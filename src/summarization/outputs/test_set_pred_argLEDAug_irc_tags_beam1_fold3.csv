Allowing the application, that although the wife upgraded her education during the marriage with encouragement and financial support from the husband, she was entitled to maintenance for an indefinite period. The court reviewed the means and needs of the parties and awarded spousal in addition to child maintenance. The court recognized the indirect financial consequences to a custodial parent in raising children.","The wife sought a divorce and maintenance for herself and the 5 year old daughter of the marriage. The parties had been married 10 years. The wife sought separation from the husband, who worked in the oil rig industry, and child support. The husband had recently retired from his employment and was caring for the child. The two parties lived separate and apart for over 1 year. The petitioner sought spousal support in the amount of $1,500 monthly for the support and maintenance of herself and her daughter and sought to have the Separation Agreement incorporated into a Corollary Relief Judgment so that jurisdiction could be expanded. The respondent sought to incorporate into the judgment the costs of the divorce and child care. The mother sought to terminate the marriage, alleging numerous financial consequences to a custodial parent not reflected in the direct cost of supporting a child. HELD: 1)The wife was entitled to spousa support for the period of 1 year to which she was ordered to pay $1 million. 2)The respondent was to pay the petitioner $1.5 million monthly for support and the child care expenses. 3)The petitioner was to bear the costs associated with the child's care. 4)The child support was to be paid in the amounts of $2,500 to the respondent. 5)The support deadline should not be placed upon the wife when she has the direct responsibility of raising the child and when the availability of more gainful employment within the foreseeable future is uncertain."
1994canlii4796.txt,"The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act. 2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy. The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused. 3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan. 4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer. In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan. There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension.","The applicant sought a declaration under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act that her interest in a group registered retirement savings plan (later defined as the 'Group Plan') was not subject to a security interest she granted to the applicant. She further sought an order restraining Crown Life from arbitrarily cancelling her participation in the Group Plan. HELD: The application for a restraining order was denied. 1)The provisions of s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act do not apply to the application. The taking of security interest by way of a loan agreement contravenes s.146(2) and s.147(3) as the provisions of the personal property security act do not exist. 2)The applicant had not retired and there appeared to be no evidence of her interest under the Group plan. The provisions of S. 146/2(3)(c) of The Personal Property security Act had not been applied. 3)The application for an order prohibiting Crown Life's interest in the group plan was dismissed. 4)The loan agreement contains no provision enabling Crown Life to collapse the applicant's account in the plan and thereby create an attachable pension refund. If it did, such provision would violate s.7.02 and s57 of the PPSA Act. 5)The provision of s 146(3(3)) does not apply. The provision of the'special purpose pension fund' under the PPPA Act does not exist in light of the provisions in s.150(2). 6)The only provision that could be applied to the individual was the provision that the taking of a security for loan on the Group plans contravene s.155(2), s.136(2); and s.(3)of the PPAA Act and the provisions that the applicant must have obtained a pension from the insurance company or be a party to a registered retirement income fund (RRIF) authorized by the PAPA. 7) and 8(3). 8)The borrower did not have to be a registered or employee association to have her interest be realized. 9)The court was of the view that nothing in the Plan Contract or the Income tax Act prohibits the applicant from pledging her interest. Since Ms. Corscadden has not retired or any pension from it, there appears to be an appropriate condition for the repayment of her indebtedness to the plan. 10)The Court was of a view that the provisions contained in the PPRA did not apply in the circumstances of"

The City applied for a review. HELD: The City's application was allowed. Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question. Pursuant to section 72 of the Act, therefore, these particular terms of the collective agreement applied since they were, when considered in light of the balance of the agreement, more favorable to the employee than the requirements of the Act.","The City applied to review a certificate issued pursuant to s. 60 of the Labour Standards Act, s. 1978 for a reduction in the assessment to $511.08 for overtime paid for hours worked over 32 hours in a weekcontaining a public holiday.

At the hearing the Director filed another letter reducing it to $300.41 (including an annual holiday) and the City applied for an order as to costs. HELD: Application allowed. 1)The collective bargaining agreement agreed to by the City and the union was deemed more favourable to the employees than the Act. 2)The provisions of the agreement should govern, and not those of the Act, the City admitted. 3)The agreement's provisions governing pay for holidays were more favourable than the act. 4)The City filed various documents, including copies of the collective bargaining agreements it has with the Amalgamated Transit Union. 5)The provision of the rate of pay was more favourable in the circumstances than the rest of the legislation. 6)The legislature intended the rate-of-pay provision in any agreement to be read and evaluated in the light of the other provisions of an agreement before comparison was made with its counterpart in the Act and 7)The benefits of holiday pay were more than the costs."

Dismissing the appeal, that the Board had correctly interpreted its jurisdiction and made findings amply supported by the evidence arising from the de novo hearing.

The petitioner had agreed to pay $3,000 per month which included child support but the support was reduced to $1,000 and was irregular and late. The two children were living with the petitioner and although old enough to hold jobs, had been unable to find employment. The petitioner's income exceeded $80,000 annually but he had been suspended with pay and the status of his employment was uncertain. HELD: 1)It was premature to fix the amount of spousal maintenance as asked for by the applicant. There were too many unknowns including the future of the petitioner's future job and income and how much the applicant would require should she go to university in the fall and what the children would do about future education. 2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the maintenance. 3)The petitioner was directed to pay $1,500 plus $200.00 per month until the shortfall was paid in full.  4)The applicant was awarded costs of the application.","FIAT. The parties separated in the summer of 1994. All other issues raised in the divorce proceeding were left in the custody of the mother. The husband had reduced the monthly spousal support to $1,000 per month from $3,000 in 1994. The wife sought interim support based on some maintenance guidelines suggested by the Government. HELD: 1)The matrimonial home had been sold and it was expected that each party would receive approximately $30,000. The net proceeds from the sale were to be distributed to the needy. 2)The application was premature. There were too many unknown factors surrounding the future situation of either party to conclude that what the applicant asks for is fair and reasonable. There was uncertainty as to the husband's future job and income. There is no evidence as to what the wife will require if she does go touniversity this fall. There are uncertainty asto what the two children will do about future education. 3)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the $1500 maintenance he consistently paid up to December 1995 to $800.00 without at least consulting the wife. She was entitled to adjust the amount of maintenance she had paid in the interim. She should have commenced the monies in direct way rather than in monies and commissions. 4)The court was of the opinion that the petitioner was entitled not to unilaterally trim the maintenance he had paid up until December 1995 without at all consulting with the wife and to commencing the monied portion of the monorail which had been directed towards the purpose of commencing in April rather than on a direct way."
1997canlii787.txt,"After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, the plaintiff, a supplier of materials to the sub-contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub-contractor. The Bond contained a provision limiting the liability of the surety and the principal to make payment to any claimant not having a contract directly with the principal. Dismissing the action with costs, that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier. With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work. As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff. Therefore, the supplier was not entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond.","After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, a supplier of materials to the sub- contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a Labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub contractor. The contract stipulated that the respondent be the supplier of the materials to its subcontractor. The respondent failed to perform the contract work and abandoned the job site. The sub-contracted company applied for a Labour & Materials Payment Bond which allowed it to recover the balance owing by the subcontractor and to recover its holdback fund. The applicant, which had been the respondent's subcontractor, brought a claim against the general and surety for payment under the Bond. The defendant argued that the mechanics' lien fund, which would have been available to all subcontractors if the Mechanics' Lien Act had applied, would have consisted of 10% of the value of the work performed by All Ports until the subcontract was complete. The plaintiff sought to recover all of the money owing to its sub- subcontractor or the 10% holdback. HELD: The claim of the plaintiff against the respondent and London Guarantee was dismissed. The Mechanics'Lien Act does not bind the Crown. If the Act had been applicable, the respondent would not have been entitled to recover anything due to the third party statutory liens. The claim against London Guarante was dismissed as not having authority to enforce the Bond or to recover costs. 1)If the Mechanics's Lien act had been applied, the supplier would not be required to pay directly to suppliers and labourers for All Ports unless some other party had a prior claim to the holdback funds. 2)If a Mechanics' liens Lien was applicable, Rideau Construction would not been entitled in the amount owing to All Ports. If it had been relevant, the plaintiff would not recover anything. 3)If an action by a subcontractor under the Act, the defendant would not automatically recover lien or privileges from the respondent. If a Mechanics's lien Act was applicable the defendant could not have set off its claim against all Ports unless a third party had prior claim. 4)If it was not for the Mechanics', Lien and Credit Union Act, then the supplier's liany and the principal would have limited to that amount owing by All Ports.

1999canlii12427.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching contrary to s.271(1) and 153 of the Criminal Code. The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor. The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused had touched her vagina and breasts numerous times on numerous occasions. She alleged that he masturbated himself over top of her clothing. He also touched her breasts and buttocks several times while she was sleeping. She called the police. An expert testified that this could be attributed to the passage through puberty into society that seems to put greater emphasis on body image as opposed to brains. HELD: The accused was acquitted. 1)The accused had an opportunity. He had an obligation. He was charged. 2)The evidence tends to confirm the accused's evidence. The accused has not shown that he is guilty of either of the sexual assault or touching allegations. The complainant's evidence of his behaviour and his anger and self-regard are not supported by the evidence of expert testimony. There is no evidence of either. The Court cannot conclude that either of his alleged offences is condoning or justifying the behaviour of the Sexual Offences Offences. The only evidence that is supported by expert testimony is that of his repeated visits to the complainant's house. He has explained his behaviour to the extent that he has been seen pulling knives on her in the bedroom. He is not a person who would have taken flaunting or shower-watching seriously. He would not have done it for the money or the attention of his children. He does not have the means to justify his behaviour. His anger and lack of remorse are not rational factors to justify this kind of behaviour. He lacks the moral compass and the evidence to convict him of his crimes. His lack of self-control and anger are not justified in the face of all the evidence. His repeated visits and inappropriate touching of the victim's body and his repeated attempts to contact her in a manner that is not consistent with his own behaviour. It is doubtful that he would have done anything to the money, attention and attention that he does not possess. 2)'The Court cannot infer from the evidence that the Sexual Assault and Touch Allegations are Alleged. The Crown must have shown that the offences are condoning and justifying his behaviour with respect to his children and his family. The 'discipline' of the accused is not an appropriate word for the offence he is accused of. 3)The Court must look to the evidence for its consistency. The following evidence tends towards confirming the accused’s evidence: The Court must consider the following: 1)There was no evidence that he was sexually abusing his children or that he"

She raised s.9 and 8 of the Charter in objecting to the arrest and seizure of the duffel bag. The voir dire occupied 5 days. HELD: 1)The four requirements set out in R. v. Feeney for a warrantless search were satisfied. The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the duffel bag was incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. 2)The accused had no expectation of privacy with respect to either her friend's residence or the bag. The decision in R. v. Edwards was squarely on point. There was no evidence tying the accused to the gym bag. It was of a different description than the one used in the drugstore robbery. The accused never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it. The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence. 3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter. To exclude the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused objected to her arrest and to the seizure of a duffel bag containing a quantity of narcotics. The police conducted a voir dire as result of opening of the trial. A great deal of evidence was presented, the majority of which was elicited in very detailed and extended cross-examination.

The arrest and seizure of the duffle bag were both lawful. Pursuant to s. 9 and 8 of the Charter the police need not demonstrate anything more than reasonable and probable grounds. If there were any violations of the accused's rights under the Charter, the police would be entitled to search an arrested person for a weapon if under the circumstances it seemed reasonable to check whether the person might be armed.

The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child.

The Notes will presumably supply some details of the required disclosure as well as some details relating to the required disclosures. The notes will presumably provide some details as to the reasons behind each stop."
2006nssc139.txt,"The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage. The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment. The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child. The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home. Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity. The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","The wife commenced divorce proceedings in November 2004.She sought custody, access, child support, spousal support and costs with a division of property. The husband sought a variation of the provisions regarding child support and spousals. The parties had separated in 2005. The wife had commenced the proceedings in early 2004. She sought custody in the joint custody of both parents, to be paid in part by the father and the mother, and to have the matrimonial home of the wife occupied by the child for the duration of her stay in the area. The father alleged that the agreement was forged to assure him that his child would not be removed from his home town and that he was prepared to give her his equity in the home and possessions, as well as a capital cost deduction of $10,625 for the net income of $22,878. The mother alleged that in order to keep the wife in the jurisdiction, the father had to pay child and spouse support in an amount that was not justified by his actual income or the circumstances of the parties lives. The evidence showed that the parties had discussed the issue of mobility in the past and that it had not been an issue between them. The agreement was based on the principles of separation and was not uniform in all respects. The principles of fairness, equity and justice were clearly unequal favouring the wife. The court ought not to interfere with the agreement between the parties. However, in light of the fact that there are significant changes in the circumstances the court can review the terms of the Separation Agreement in this divorce proceeding and set an appropriate amount of child support."
2006skqb382.txt,"The petitioner seeks child and spousal support. The parties signed a separation agreement and interspousal contract in July 2004. With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1) The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum. The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'. This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support. The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist. 2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program. Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year. The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006. It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000. Child support will be ordered based on $53,000 on an interim basis.","The petitioner sought child support and spousal support pending trial. The parties signed a separation agreement in July 2004. The agreement provided that the respondent was to pay one half of the net income to the petitioner by way of equal monthly payments of spousals. The interspousal contract provided that support would be based on division of income until July 2011. The petitioner had been taking home study courses and the respondent had been receiving ongoing spousousal/offences in the form of computer consulting. The respondent and the petitioner had agreed that the petitioner should continue her homeopathy training and education even if the respondent's employment was terminated. The wife alleged that the parties had reached a substantial change in circumstances in which the respondent would have to take some steps to continue his employment. HELD: 1)The agreement was not intended to vary the spousaling support obligation in the event of a material change in circumstance. 2)The petitioner was entitled to support under the agreement and the circumstances as they presently existed. The court noted that the interspoiral contract did not contemplate a variation of the spouseal support obligation. 3)The parties agreed that when the Court was asked to make an interim order and there is an existing interspouseal contract which deals with spousa support, it is often not feasible to apply Miglin, supra, analysis. In this case the petitioner was seeking support under an interspousing contract. The amount payable shall be reduced in an amount equal to 40% of the petitioner's income that she has earned. 4)The court was concerned that the stubble income of the respondent remained a taxable income for the purposes of the contract. It was not in the sense of an interim application that the Court would be hesitant to make such an order. The stubble amount of income was $65,000. 5)The respondent was entitled not to impute income but to pay the sum of $65 per annum to the wife. The issue of costs was left to the trial judge.  6)The interspoleal contract does not contemplate variation of spouse support in the circumstances. It will be for the trial court to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference in paragraphs 7.3 and 7.5 to adjustments which will consider the likely future earnings based upon whether the respondent is no longer employed and whether he has the means to pay those expenses. There was no question that the $65 stubble was a result of the husband's decision to take a corporation out of"
2007skqb376.txt,"The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated. The application is dismissed.","The petitioner asks the court to vary the child support order granted the day after the Justice R.D. Maher changed the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. The respondent argues that there has been a clear declaration in two separate writings of the oldest child's desire to have primary residence change from her father to her mother. Further, there is some evidence that the younger child wishes to also live with her mother or, at the least, live in the same residence as her older sister. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1)As no material change has been demonstrated, this application must be dismissed. 2)As little change has actually been demonstrated the Court must be satisfied that there was a material change in the circumstances of the child since the last custody order was made. 3)As the evidence before the Court was too much conflict on the affidavits, a hearing was often ordered. 4)As there was no material difference in the situation the Court found that the respondent's application must not be dismissed as there was not a material one."
2009skqb36.txt,"FIAT: This is an application to determine interim parenting for the child, Kaira, who is 2.5 years old. There is conflicting information about the nature and extent of the petitioner father's parenting duties. The respondent has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child go with her. The petitioner would like Kaira to remain in Saskatchewan and have regular contact with each parent on alternating weeks. HELD: 1) The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The Court cannot determine on conflicting affidavits what the primary parent status quo is. 2) It is in the best interest that the child see both parents. There was a similar course in Saskatoon that the respondent could have taken which would have made more frequent changes possible, but her affidavit indicates she thinks the Saskatoon course is inferior to the one she is taking in Victoria. 3) Pending trial the child shall be parented by the petitioner for 28 days, and thereafter by the respondent for 28 days and such parenting shall continue to alternate for each 28 day period thereafter until further order.

There is conflicting affidavit evidence respecting the nature and extent of the father's parenting duties while the parties lived together. The mother, Lesly, has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child with her. The issues of parenting and mobility are clearly unresolved and may go to trial. HELD: The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The residence Status quo in that case is Lesly. She has chosen not to take school in Victoria but that does not mean that even if Lesly is the primary child that the child will continue to live in Regina and therefore, the status quo is to be maintained unless there are compelling reasons not to do so as were found in both cases. The respondent cannot determine on conflicting affidavits what the primary parenting status quo was. Lesly has chosen, albeit in a different location, to have KairA with her and she will continue with the child's frequent visits to her parents. The issue of parenting, mobility and change in residence status in this application is to determine the primary status quo. HOLD: The status quo remains Regina and the child shall, until trial, live in the city. The primary parent status quo for this case shall reside in the Regina and pending trial Kairala shall reside with Lesly until trial. The distance from Regina and Victoria should not be in the way of the child living in the country. The applicant shall pay for the cost of transporting Kairas to and from Victoria. The costs of transporting the child to andfrom Victoria shall be primarily borne by Lesly because she has made choices which have resulted in greater expense to insure that Kairae sees both parents.

2009skqb445.txt,"The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances. The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1) There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence. In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos. The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","The accused was charged with possession of stolen goods and conspiracy to sell drugs. The accused was to appear on a charge under s.7, 11(d) and 24 of the Charter of Rights, Part of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule to the Canada Act 1982. The motion sought to have the accused provided with full disclosure in usable format. The issues were whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence had been provided; and whether the format was reasonably accessible. HELD: The accused's disclosure was requested in a fashion that would be appropriate for the preliminary hearing to proceed. 1)The disclosure was provided in a reasonably accessible manner. It was not necessary to obtain hard copies of any documents. The Crown provided hard copies. 2)The nature and format of disclosure provided to date was appropriate in that it has been provided in reasonably accessible fashion. It does not detract from the right of the accused's defence to make full answer. 3)The format was appropriate. The disclosure was well-conceived and the material was reasonably available. There was no need for the Crown to provide hard copies or hard copies in any format. There is no need to provide copies of all the police officers' notebooks in full, in chronological order. The cost of obtaining the police officer's notebooks in whole, in a chronological order is significant not just in terms of printing costs but in counsel's time in locating it. In this case, the Crown should provide hard copy of the notes made by police officers in their notebooks. 4)The notebook format was suitable as there was no evidence that the notes related to specific cases were not available to the defence through the electronic disclosure. The notebook format suited the accused and was reasonably convenient. 5)The standard of disclosure was appropriate given the nature of the evidence gathered. The notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the accused in hard copy in chronological fashion. 6)The use of hard copies was appropriate as there is no evidence of the specific task or specific time period that was required to access the data. The use of non-destructive tools was appropriate but not necessary. The ease and cost of locating the documents was high."
2009skqb506.txt,"The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession. The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person. The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","The tenant appealed a decision of the Office of Residential Tenancies. The tenant had signed a 3-year lease in the landlord's home and had attempted to rent it for the past three years. The landlord had refused to vacate and the tenant sought an order for possession. The hearing officer found that the landlord had breached the tenant's rights by serving notice to vacue and sought an Order for Possession of the rental unit. The Landlord appealed. Appeal dismissed. The tenancy agreement between the landlord and the landlord was a written tenancy agreement. The Hearing Officer found that although the landlord signed the agreement in good faith, it was only for the tenant to give notice of vacate if there was a second tenant living in the premises and if the tenant was not prejudiced by any error or omission in the written agreement. There was no valid tenancy agreement in force between the tenant and the second tenant. The applicant had signed the lease in goodfaith and was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. The second tenant had rented out a portion of the house to the tenant in good-faith and had signed another 3- year lease. The third tenant, who lived in the home with her children, sought an orders for possession in order to allow her to move into her new home. The first tenant, the landlord, sought possession of the property under a written lease agreement. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The tenancy agreement was not valid. The Court held that the hearing officer made an error in law in finding that the tenant did not have the authority to vacuitate. 2)The hearing officer did not err in law by deciding that the tenants had not signed the written tenancy agreements. 3)The Act applies to tenancy agreements, rental units and other residential property. Section 7 of the Residential Tenancy Act provides for the equitable distribution of rights between landlord and tenant. Section 8 of the Act provides that a landlord may make an order pursuant to s.2(f)(i) of the residential Tenancies Act for possession of a rental unit for the purposes of section 70 of the tenancy agreement and for an order respecting the rights of a tenant to pay rent until such time as the issues are settled. 4)Section 7 of The Residential Tenances Act provides the terms of an application for possession and for relief pursuant to section 70. The Act applies only to tenancy agreement, rental unit and circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. 5)The Hearing Officer did not make an"
2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","The parties were previously divorced and had been together for seven years. The petitioner now sought access to her daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties had been married for seven and a half years. They had two children, one of whom was 11 years old. The respondent had previously been convicted and incarcerated for sexually assaulting the petitioner. The child had a close relationship with the respondent and her mother was his biological mother. The relationship between the respondent's two children and the petitioner had spanned the years 2000 to 2007. The residence was small and there was insufficient room for everyone once the petitioner's daughters arrived from British Columbia. The marriage had sprozed and the respondent had provided child care and assistance during the petitioner’s first two years in the residence. The appellant claimed that because he was a “step-parent” to the petitioner, he did not need to establish that he had a ‘sufficient interest’ in order to bring this application. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The respondent demonstrated that he was not only a person of sufficient interest but also a person with a sufficient interest in the relationship. He had established that he stood in the place of parent to the child and that his role in the home was limited and sporadic. The court found that the respondent demonstrated he was capable of providing support and assistance to the children. 2) The petitioner had not established that his position in the situation was limited to the benefit of one child and therefore was not in the best interests of the petitioner in the circumstances. The evidence did not support his position. The Court found that access was not warranted in this case."
2011nssc455.txt,"The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","The accused was charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The accused sought severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases: to allow three separate trials in all; and to separate for trial all of the so-called status offences. The only possible link conceded was the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the gun on both days. The second proposed basis was to separate all of these so- called status offences from those pertaining to April 8th and April 14th. The Court was made aware that the Crown has in the wings of a ballistics report containing expert opinion evidence that match has been made between the gun used in the April 8 and 14th shooting and that found by the arresting police officers on April 14. The Crown argued this was a case where severance was required in the interests of justice because it would allow the accused to better represent his right to a fair trial and to better control his defence in a single trial. The court was able to observe the videotaped interview of the accused conducted by the police in the early morning hours of April 15, 2010 and it was clear that the accused adamantly disclaimed any association with the subject handgun whatsoever. He maintained that the gun was not his and that he had nothing to do with it on April 8 or the 14th either. The evidence that the guns were not his or were not of the type were found in the accused's possession or use on those two days was not admissible. The appeal against severance on both bases was dismissed."
2_1999canlii12669.txt,"The respondent seeks an order for interim spousal support. The parties were married in January 1991 with three children and ceased to cohabit in December of 1996. The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT. The respondent sought an order for interim spousal support. HELD: The Court concluded that relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should not take the form of spousAL support. The Court should not substitute the traditional form of support which is the reduction in the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The petitioner's income is $580 per month. The Matrimonial property valued at $293,874 is rented out and the difference in value relates to a section of land which contains the matrimonial home. The difference in values relates to the amount of rent paid by the respondent in the marriage. The $2,292.58 is the result of an arbitrary and artificial attribution and is the basis upon which the respondent's income was adequately provided for. The Federal Child support Guidelines would stipulate a payment of $442 per month with the CPPP benefits to be paid in the amount if they were received by the Canada Pension Plan. The CPPP benefit was not included in the calculation of spic and span. The remaining monies should be paid by way of monthly payments in the sum of $500. The balance of $6,000 should be given to the respondent by monthly payments of $1,111 if he is required to pay out an additional $500 and the CPP benefit was ordered in the alternative of $10,000. The remainder of the monies owed by the petitioner to the husband should be deducted by spousals to the petitioner in the event of a request for spousousal assistance. The court awarded the balance of the $6 million to the wife with the option of monthly payment in the formof monthly payments. The CPP benefit will not affect the children as the CPPs are receiving $508 by wayof the Canada pension plan benefits. The PST benefit was awarded for the mother with the balance to be used by monthly payment of the balance in the $500 case. The CNSP benefits were not included as an alternative to the CPPS because they were not part of the petitioner's monthly income. The husband's CPPS income was $2 million at the time of separation and he was entitled to $10 per month in the meantime. The wife's CPSP income was also awarded as part of her income. In the alternative the husband was entitled $10 in spous and equity in the joint venture and the balance should be left to the spouse by monthly spousally support payments of the sum in the figure of $5,000 and the husband's spous"

The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault. The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.","The two accused were charged on separate informations with assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and wilfully damaging the windows of a car contrary to ss. 430(4) of the Code. HELD: The accused were found not guilty of the first count on information 24414281. The Court found that the evidence applied over to the other information.  1) The physical altercation in this case was precipitated by jealousy or by a drug deal gone bad. There is no doubt that the accused were the aggressors throughout. He smashed in one, if not two, car windows, he chased after the complainant with Dagenais' help and then rushed up the stairs toward the trailer. This was threatening behaviour and the accused said they were going to punch the complainant in the face. 2) The accused admitted to breaking the front passenger window of the car but denied any involvement with the altercation. The evidence was that Dagenaisi choked him at one point and he was forced to watch and do nothing. The Crown and the defence both filed a report from a doctor who examined the complainant later in the day. The doctor testified that the complainant had two puncture wounds to his face, elbow and lip and that he suspected Dagenaises was involved in the punch. He testified that Dagendais choked him and he got choked at one time.  3) The Court was satisfied that the injuries were not that severe and that the altercation was not caused by either the accused or Dagenaias' involvement. The actions of the accused was aggressive and the judge believed that the plaintiff when he said that he felt threatened. This is threatening behaviour that the defendant when he stated that he was not there to apologize. As the complainant said, he felt assaulted."
2_2010skqb402.txt,"The defendant applied for dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution. The claim was issued November 1, 1999 and is based in debt for goods and services provided to the defendant. The value of the claim is $521,283.99 and refers to provision of materials, products and services in 1995 and 1996. The statement of defence was filed November 12, 1999 and amended in 2002. In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary. A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48. In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided. Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference. There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case. The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short. While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance. Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial. The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action. The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied.","The defendant applied for the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The plaintiff had issued a consent order in 1999 which authorized the appointment of a Band Councillor as the proper representative for the First Nation. In 2002 the consent order was amended to order that the defendant return $40,000 paid by the plaintiff to the plaintiff. In 2004 the plaintiff filed a motion seeking to dismiss the action for wantof prosecution on the basis that the defendants had refused to return the $100,000 that had been paid by Ochapowace to McDiarmid. In 2006 the defendant filed an application seeking to have the action dismissed for wanton prosecution on behalf of the First Nations. The respondent brought an application requesting an order returning the $40 million paid by both Ochampowace and McDiampowacy to Mcdiarmid and retained by the latter are live issues raised by the pleadings. HELD: The application for dismissal for want for wantoffence was granted. 1)The delay was inordinate and legally inexcusable. Although the plaintiff and Ochapeowace had been in agreement that Laird Allary was the appropriate person to be examined for discovery, the circumstances under which this payment was made by O.Chapowance to McDarmid were still issues raised. 2)The plaintiff was permitted to pursue its claim. The onus is on the respondent to demonstrate its seriousness in bringing this matter to trial. 3)The respondent, which had undertaken extensive examinations and conducted numerous discovery conferences, did not provide the sought after undertakings. 4)The applicant failed to meet the onus of proving serious prejudice. 5)The affidavit filed by the respondent that LairD Allary had been examined for the purpose of representing the plaintiff was not a factor to be considered.  6)The evidence did not exist at the time of the discovery. 7)The defendant did not have the means to obtain the undertakings required to complete them. 8)The petitioner was not responsible for the delay in bringing the action to trial on its own. 9)The court was cognizant of the fact that the delay was beyond the scope of the ICC case and it was pertinent to determine whether the ICC action should proceed. 10)The Court was cognisant of issues including the delay between the issuance of the consent orders and the examination of the defendant's records. 11)The parties were in agreement the defendant would be examined by Bellanger."
2_2011nssc486.txt,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children, one of which was in the mother's custody. The mother had been very good to the father but also became hostile and dismissive. The father resisted any change to the arrangement and, in the interim, sought $502 per month in child support to cover the mother’s expenses. The parties had discussed and agreed to a parenting plan in the hope of preventing a repeat of the 2000 relationship. The plan was not based on the best interests of the children but rather on the mother and her witnesses. The evidence from the father and his witnesses differed materially from that given by the mother. The court found that the information provided by the father, his witnesses and the mother in respect to the serious and damaging allegations regarding the mother was credible. The information provided from the mother, his and her witness, was not credible. Decisions about the children’S education and health and dental care must be made by the parties, and the court retains the discretion to modify the set-off amount where, considering the childrens needs, it would lead to a significant variation in the standard of living experienced by the children as they move from one household to the other."
2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to declare him a dangerous offender. The accused had been convicted of assaulting a peace officer. The offence had a serious personal injury offence, which included two counts of assaulting the officer. In the context of the other offences, the accused had committed violent offences against police officers and had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and been recommitted to the Penitentiary and breached a conditional sentence order once. The Crown alleged that the accused exhibited extreme indifference to the officers and was in a combative or assaultive stance. HELD: The accused was sentenced to a term of 10 years for the offences of violence against a peace Officer and a term for use of violence in the sense of'serious personal injury'. The accused's offences were serious personal injuries and the offences were violent. The court found that given the accused's lengthy criminal history and the fact that he had been involved in many violent offences, it would appear that the offences he had committed were serious, but not so serious that a sentence of 10 year would be appropriate. The Court found that the offence was a'serious Personal Injury offence' as defined by s. 752. The offender had a lengthy and violent history and had multiple convictions. The offences were of serious personal injence. The fact that the weapon was of such a size that it could be used in a serious way could cause serious damage. The impact on the officer was severe. The officer was injured when he fired the weapon at the accused. The assault was of longer duration and the victim was affected by the actions of the accused by the action."
3_1995canlii4402.txt,"The respondent expropriated a parcel of land owned by the appellant. Prior to a hearing, all claims for the case were settled for the sum of $20,000. The appellant's solicitor presented solicitor and client accounts of $19,420 plus taxes. The respondent directed taxation, and the appellant's solicitor submitted further accounts for services and disbursements of the taxation hearing amounting to $7,212.24. The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000. He proceeded to tax the account at $14,000, disallowed any costs of the taxation hearing, and disallowed a claim for interest on interim accounts submitted by the solicitor. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal and confirming the taxation, that the taxing master did not make any errors in law. He was entitled to consider as one of the relevant factors the relationship of the total account to the recovery.","The appellant sought to expropriate land which included almost all of the appellant's backyard for the purpose of widening the Bedford Highway. The expropriation resolution was filed at the Registry on September 7, 1993. The effective date of expropriations was September 8, 1993 and the effective date was set in 1994. The appellant received an appraisal report from the respondent's solicitor and in a decision in August 1994 he reduced the account to $14,000 plus taxes. The respondent appealed the decision of the taxing master to abandon the expropriated land retaining only an easement necessary for the footing. At the hearing, the taxmaster awarded $5,855 in full compensation for the appellant interest. The appellants suggested the taxman disallowed any services that were actually incurred. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the taxation of costs by the tax master confirmed. 1)The appellant had no liability for legal services, and after the expatriation they had not been placed substantially in the same position as before. 2)The appellants were correct in describing the appellant as a professional expropriator. 3)The appeal was based on an incomplete accounting of the expounded expropriational process. The accountant had prepared a solicitor-client account to the City in the amount of $19,420 plus taxes representing approximately 100 hours time spent on file. The solicitor-manager account was taxed by the City and in the decision in November 1995 he reduced it to $12,000. 4)The court was bound by the decision as it was of the Court of Appeal."
3_1995canlii6053.txt,"The accused was charged with failing to appear at his trial on a charge of impaired driving. The impaired driving charge was subsequently stayed. When the charge of failing to appear came on for trial the accused claimed a 'lawful excuse' for his failure to appear on the impaired driving charge. His excuse was that the next shift at work had failed to arrive on time and that this had made it impossible for him to get to court on time. This excuse was rejected and he was convicted. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Whether an accused has a lawful excuse is determined with reference to common law principles. It normally includes all of the defences which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 2)The Court was unable to say that the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor could it say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.","The accused sought to overturn his conviction for failing to attend court by arguing that the trial judge ought to have accepted his excuse for not appearing. At issue was whether the accused advanced a 'lawful excuse' for not attending court. HELD: The trial judge rejected the accused's submission that he had a 'lawsful excuse'. 1)The Crown had stayed the original impaired driving charge against the accused stayed. The defence argued that the judge should have accepted the accused\'s excuse for failingto attend. 2)The accused had previously informed his lawyer of the court date. 3)The trial judge abandoned the defence of the accused failing to appear by telephone or by text message. 4)The Supreme Court of Canada commented on R. v. Holmes which indicate that a 'Lawful excuse"" includes all defences the common law considers sufficient for an excuse. It can also include excuses specific to particular offences. If Parliament does not give some indication that it has assigned a particular meaning to 'excuse', the word will be taken to have the same meaning as 'excus' under the common Law and as used in s.7(3) [now s.8(3)] of the Criminal Code."
3_1997canlii11217.txt,"Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them. The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996. The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions.","The petitioner brothers were three brothers from the District of Perdue, Saskatchewan who carried on a family farm operation and operated a farm implement dealership business. In 1985, the accountant for the petitioner firm recommended that they become involved in certain real estate partnerships in order to derive certain tax advantages.

The respondent, in turn, received an ex parte order directing him to preserve and retain intact and in specie various market securities (the Securities) previously owned by the petitioner and purportedly seized by the respondent in the amount of $50,286.77.

The accountant for respondent, who now resides in Surrey, British Columbia, has confirmed that he is indebted to the petitioner in the sum of $3,000., and that he has ceased to meet his liabilities generally as they becomedue. HELD: The Court found no extenuating circumstances which would warrant the granting of a receiving order. The material discloses very substantial financial hardships visited upon the petitioner as result of the respondent's refusal to pay the debts owed by him. Further, the evidence establishes that the petitioner is awealthy individual who is quite capable of paying his debts but has simply chosen not to do so. He earned over $1.4 million in his last four years as professional hockey player. He has the means to pay his debts and should be required to doso. Therefore a receiving Order shall issue."

The father would have access on alternating weekends and for a three hour period one weekday provided the child was returned by the bedtime set by the mother. Although both parents genuinely love the child and were equally competent caregivers, neither demonstrated that sole parenting offered an advantage to him.

3_2002skca56.txt,"A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users. A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services). The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order.

3_2003canlii64101.txt,"The mother moved for the dismissal of the pending permanent care trial, arguing that, applying the reasoning in a recent Court of Appeal decision, the court had lost jurisdiction. No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties. The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel. Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed. The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial. When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act. When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date.","The mother sought a dismissal of the motion under the Children and Family Services Act by which the court had lost its jurisdiction to hear the case. The trial was to commence tomorrow. The court had previously held that it would not order reapprehension. It would instead prefer to have the matter proceed beyond the overall deadline. The applicant had made no effort to contact the Department of Community Services, who had already made a decision regarding the permanent care application. Allowing the application and extending the trial to tomorrow's time would not be in the child's best interests. In the B.F. case, the trial court extended the statutory deadline for the first disposition hearing and then conducted the trial which gave one of the dispositions authorized by s. 42 of the Act which was to be reviewed within the statutory deadlines. Jurisdiction was not lost. In this case, which was the first case to be decided under the Child and Family Protection Act, the court has not lost its ability to hear this matter."

HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack. The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As stated in McCallum, the fact that the effects of alcohol may have been exacerbated by the accused suffering from fatigue does not provide a defence to the charge.",The accused was charged with having the care or control of a motor vehicle while his ability to operate a motor Vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The accused's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The accused's blood alcohol content was.60. The court found that the accused's symptoms of impairment were the result of a panic attack not from the consumption of alcohol. 2)The evidence did not support the accused’s diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (G.A.D.). The court noted that the symptoms of G.A.(D.) were found to be similar to a panic attacks. 3)The court found no evidence that the defence or accused of common sense impairment was necessary to establish that the evidence supported the accused being in such an attack.

The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim. The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674. HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption. 2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant. 3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing. 4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis.","The Workers' Compensation Board denied benefits to the applicant for the death of her husband on the basis that the applicant had not applied for benefits within the six month period contemplated in the Workers' compensation Act.

The Saskatchewan Workers' Pension Board had previously been found to be within the meaning of s30 but had now been found not to apply the presumption contained in s45.  6)Section 46 did not apply in the circumstances. 7)The Saskatchewan Workers “properly” stated that s45 should not bar a person from compensation where the board considers that the claim for compensation is just and should be allowed. 8)Section 48 did not include a finding that the deceased had a second or third condition, which was the result thereof. 9)The Board was aware that the husband had been performing work duties at the university and not while he was on campus to attend class or to study. 10)The findings of the trial judge were not relevant to the application of s45 or s45 in the sense that s47 was not applied in the meaning under s30 and were therefore not relevant. 11)The issues raised by the appeal were whether the board erred in its interpretation of s50 or whether the privatives clause was patent unre"

By this fiat an order was granted pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 344 itemizing the household contents and personal items removed by the respondent from the matrimonial home in order to allow for a Writ of Delivery and prohibiting the respondent from disposing of any of the assets that the respondent had removed from the matrimonial home and also requiring him to pay all outstanding utility payments and other expenses associated with his occupation of the matrimonial home. The judge declined to cite the respondent for contempt.,"FIAT. Following a trial before me in November 1993, the Courtissued a judgment dealing with a number of issues including the division of matrimonial property. The judgment dealt with the division into two parts: the first part sought an order pursuant to Rule 344 to prevent the respondent from violating the previous order of November that nothing be removed from the matrimononial home or any assets disposed of. HELD: The motion was motion denied. 1)The Court had previously held that a formal extension of the judgment of December 1993 had never been issued. The Law permits the Court to vary its judgment and to give directions on how the judgment should be carried out whether or not a formal order is issued by the Court. 2)The prayer for relief sought was allowed in part. The prayer for return was allowed on short notice. The court was left with no alternative but to assist the petitioner in regaining the assets taken out of the house."

He contends that the trial judge so concerned himself with the question of credibility of the complainant and the accused that he overlooked his duty to consider evidence of a witness, 'together with the rest of the evidence, with a view to determining whether it raised a reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt, irrespective of whether he believed the evidence of the complainant.' HELD: Appeal dismissed and conviction accordingly affirmed.  1)Great deference to findings of credibility made at trial should be shown. 2)The trial judge did not say that he found the accused guilty only upon the credibility of the complainant and the accused. He said that he found the Crown's evidence to be credible, and the accused's evidence not to be credible. The Crown's evidence was comprised of both the complainant and the witness. 3)The trial judge's findings are supported by the evidence and his conclusions are not clearly wrong so as to make the conviction unreasonable.",The accused appealed his conviction for assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.

4_2007skqb438.txt,"The parties have two children, a son born March 1990 and a daughter December 1991. A trial on the issues of the son's residence in 2006, the parties' income for the purposes of child support and any s. 7 expenses was held. HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son. This is a period of no more than 5 months. Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.  2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629. The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3) The parties have been divorced since 1998. The son has played baseball since 2004. The daughter has speed skated since 2001. The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father. It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years. The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription. The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%. Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5) Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794. His income is considerably higher now. His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","The respondent father applied to vary an order made May 14, 2002 by the court. The order provided for child support payable to the petitioner mother on behalf of the two youngest children, Michael, born March 15, 1990, and Jessica, born December 30, 1991. The parties were divorced in 1998. The petitioner mother and father lived with the mother since the parties divorced in February 1998. In 2006, the father decided to move from the west side of Saskatoon to a larger, more expensive apartment in the east side and added an additional $1,000 to the total. The respondent father did not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9. HELD: 1)The parties were responsible for their proportionate share of expenses according to their income. 2)The respondent was not entitled to costs in the amount of $500 as he did not produce receipts for reimbursement. 3)The evidence that the father paid half of the expenses was not accepted. 4)The father was discharged from his employment as a truck driver. 5)The petitioner mother's income was $25,672.37. The father's proportionate shares were 80% and 20% of the mother's was 20%. 6)The court was not able to order the mother to produce receipts. 7)The onus is on the parent wishing to invoke the operation of s. to demonstrate to the court's satisfaction that a shared custody arrangement as contemplated by s. is in fact in place and has been in place for some time. While it is not necessary that there be in all circumstances written or oral evidence that it is in place to determine the appropriate level of child support, it is instructive to take into account three factors in determining the appropriate amount of childsupport, namely the Table support applicable to each party; any increased costs associated with the shared custody arrangements; and the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of each parent and children for whom support is sought. 8)Costs in the amounts of $2,000 were awarded to the mother."
4_2007skqb51.txt,"FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s. 7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, October 2005. While he acknowledges an obligation to pay child support and there is an issue as to his income and whether the interim order should be made retroactive. HELD: 1) The respondent is entitled to pay $185 per month directly to the child care provider which represents one-half of the current child care costs for employment purposes.  2) The petitioner is entitled on an interim basis to $185 in monthly child support. On an interim, there shall be an order that the respondent continue to pay retroactive child support to January 2006. 3) The parties' verbal agreement following their separation that the petitioner would have the children during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday was not changed. 4) The Court was not prepared to deduct the $9,600 from the petitioner's 2006 income."
4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 1,200 postings on the website, which included 11 stories that were the subject of the charge. The site encouraged stories, and the defendant encouraged others to submit stories. The sentencing judge found that the defendant was more of a voyeur than actively sexual with girls and that denunciation and deterrence were the dominant principles of sentencing. The accused had not accessed the internet since he was arrested and stated he did not own a computer, he had never owned a computer and did not intend to again access the internet. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years and an order of finding in counsellor to be put on probation. The sentences were set out to discourage the dissemination of child pornography. The Court found that a conditional sentence would not be strong enough to deter others who might be inclined to engage in the activity of distributing child porn. The offender had no criminal record and was now serving the social purpose of looking after his ailing mother who lived on an isolated acreage and who will be punished if he is incarcerated. The sentence was considerably shorter than the maximum sentence of 12 months, which would not outweigh the deterrence benefits of a conditional sentencing."
4_2009skca102.txt,"The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","The Crown appealed a manslaughter sentence imposed in the death of their 7-month-old daughter. The mother pled guilty to manslaughter in February 2009 and was sentenced to 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis of the facts.  1) The essential facts were not in dispute. The respondent was a high school student and had a troubled history of abuse, domestic abuse and sexual abuse. She had stopped working after the incident because of the stress of the children and because she was afraid of losing custody. 2) The respondent had a history of mental health problems, including depression, alcohol abuse and substance abuse. Her circumstances were not similar to those of the father. 3) The sentence imposed was not appropriate for the age of 18. The severe trauma and mental health issues of the child did not warrant a sentence of four years less one day. 4) The court noted the father's dysfunctional upbringing or dysfunctional life was put forth as an aggravating factor. 5) The sentencing judge did not give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability in it and failed to address s. 718.01 of the Code. The court was satisfied the sentencing judge should have been guided by the decision of this Court in R. v. Hathway, [6] where it held that a comparable sentence for child abuse in the context of a similar offence was imposed in Saskatchewan. The sentencing court directed the court to a very narrow range of authorities, which is that case identifying the appropriate range of sentences, case identifying a case, case from another jurisdiction with sentence at the low end of the range because of its personal circumstances of the accused. The judge was clearly alive to the seriousness of the offences."
4_2011nssc71.txt,"The judge declared the defendants could pay legal fees from third party loans without offending two prior execution orders that prevented them from disposing of any property. The declaration was explicitly made on the assumption that the loans would not be secured against the defendants' existing assets. Later, the defendants' counsel wrote to the court essentially indicating he could not confirm the loans would not be secured against any assets. The court issued this supplemental decision. In the absence of any evidence the loans will not be secured against assets already subject to the execution order, or will not otherwise reduce those assets, the order and declaration sought can no longer be granted.","The defendants sought an order confirming their ability to pay certain amounts for billed and unbilled time without the terms of two execution orders previously issued against them, as well as their moving parties. The plaintiffs sought an Order confirming their borrowing ability and allowing them to pay the retainers and legal fees they incurred in the motion hearing. The moving parties objected, alleging the court had misapprehended their oral submissions. HELD: The order was refused. The court was unable to grant the requested order. It was not clear how the third party loans came from or if they will reduce the exigents' assets available for execution."
4_2015skca111.txt,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","The father was ordered to pay retroactive child support for a period of time varying from a previous order to one in which he had received an immediate driver’s licence suspension and applied to vary the interim order which had resulted in the father abandoning his request to change the primary residence of his daughter to another residence. The parties had agreed in 2011 to fix support by varying the previous order. In 2012, the father applied to have the Court of Queen’S Bench in charge of the child support application. In doing so, the court distinguished between an interim order and a final order. The interim order was a final one made pursuant to the parties’ agreement and the final order was not final. The final order made by the court was the one which set out the amount of child support payable for the period from January 1, 2009 to August 31, 2012. The individual’d child support obligation was reduced to $1,500 per month from the original order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The court drew a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. The court reviewed the various cases that dealt with the same issues and concluded that the court had not reached the conclusion it had reached in the individual cases. 2)The plaintiff had failed to establish that the defendant had not been properly advised of changes in circumstances. The defendant’ s position was that the Court could not make a determination based on the evidence. 3)The defendant had failed in his obligations under the previous consent order to vary his child support order. There was no evidence that he had failed or misapprehended the facts. 4)The Court reviewed the numerous other cases that had been tried in relation to the same child support orders. 5)The appeal was allowed on the basis that the trial judge had not properly instructed the defendant to vary a previous support order and that the issues on appeal were whether the defendant”d have the jurisdiction to vary that order? 6)The evidence that the applicant had failed, in relation, to inform the parties of the material changes, was not relevant to the trial court”s determination and the appeal was adjourned for a further time."

The Plaintiff called several expert witnesses who testified that, in their opinion, the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire. Ford called one witness who was the designer of of the truck's fuel system and a Ford employee. He testified that the defective fuel line could not have leaked sufficient fuel to cause the fire.

The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing.

5_1998canlii13955.txt,"An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits. The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","The respondent SGI terminated the respondent's benefits pursuant to s. 197 of the Act. The respondent applied to the court pursuant to S. 197 for an order setting aside such termination. HELD: SGI's benefits were terminated. The deceased farmer was a farmer and received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis that he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. The primary objective of SGI was to find that the deceased was suffering from post-accident depression and thus had a valid reason for his termination of benefits. The court found that SGI had not properly prepared the victim's benefits in accordance with s. 129(1)(e) of the act. SGI shall pay the difference, if any, between the amount paid to the victim for the period September 24 to October 23, 1997 and the amount required to be paid pursuant to the judgment for the September 24 date to the date of the commencement date of his employment in Alberta. The victim was awarded interest on such a date as was calculated by SGI. The Court ordered that the benefits be terminated."
5_2000canlii3680.txt,"After being sexually assaulted, applicant was voluntarily released from Canadian Armed Forces. She applied for and was denied a pension. Civil proceedings were commenced and the Crown defended on the basis that before initiating civil proceedings, applicant was obliged to appeal denial of pension or seek review by Minister of pension rejection. Applicant applied to strike out that portion of defence application allowed. The applicant applied for and was denied a pension. Therefore no pension was at this time payable to her. A review by the Minister would require new information and the appeal period had expired. The applicant should not be denied her right to proceed against the Crown in such circumstances.","The plaintiff was voluntarily released from the military after a seven year period following the sexual assault. She applied to Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) for a pension. The VAC denied the plaintiff's application and the limitation period for appealing the decision had expired. The Crown brought an application to strike the plaintiff’s statement of claim on the basis it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The plaintiff brought an action for damages against the federal government seeking a pension under s. 111 of the Pension Act. The defence of the Crown in this action was that, having been denied the application for a benefit by the RCMP, and having failed to appeal in time, the plaintiff was prevented from bringing this proceeding because she failed to pursue the administrative process. HELD: The plaintiff was not entitled to bring this proceeding on the grounds that, pursuant to s. 11 of the Pensions Act, the action against the Crown had been commenced in tort. The limitation period was expired and the plaintiff could only proceed with the action for civil action. 1)The court found that s. 10 of the Act, s. 91 of the Liability and Proceedings Act or Crown Liability & Proceedings Act could not be read having regard to the authorities to amount to the proposition that having been refused a pension by the government for sexual assault the plaintiff is now barred from bringing an action against them for damages. 2)The plaintiff had never made an application for pension. It was inconceivable that having received a pension in the course of her service that she was precluded from bringing the proceeding because, assuming an individual accepted the Minister’ denial but believed for reasons unrelated to the pension application they were entitled to relief or remedy against the employer. 3)The Court noted that s.(1) of the LAA could not possibly be read as imposing an obligation on the employee to apply for a pensions and further obligation upon him to prove that pension is not payable. The Court noted the following in dismissing the plaintiff: 4)Section 111 of s. 8 of the CEA cannot be read either because s. 9 of the pension act or s.111 of the Canada Pension Act cannot be interpreted to amount either to s.(2) or (3) to the contrary. The provisions contained in s.(4) of s.(8) of The Pension Act or of the Code of Conduct cannot be put aside to amount in the proposition the plaintiff had failed to bring an action pursuant to the provisions of the (1) and (2) of S. 11(3) of P"
5_2001skqb463.txt,"This judgment applies to both QBG No. 1040/98 and QBG No. 1041/98 respecting the contract between the city and Triple P Holdings and the January 21, 1997 contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required. The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.","The plaintiffs brought a motion to dismiss the action on the basis that the plaintiffs had failed to apply the rotation of truckers described in the general contract between the city and the Independent Truckers Association. The defendants had pleaded that there was no privity of contract between them and the City and thereby prevented from enforcing the terms as agreed by the City, the Association, the contractor and the trucking association. The plaintiffs had intended to present the case that the contract was the whole arrangement between the City/A.R. and the union, the union and the city of Regina and thereby excluded the plaintiffs from enforcing their terms. The issue of privity could have been a critical issue in different circumstances but in the end this case would not turn on the question of privities."

The only material difference in testimonies was whether there was a half-ton truck in front of the plaintiff's vehicle when the collision occurred. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was not proven on a balance of probabilities. The physical evidence did not assist and the court was unable to conclude that one version was correct and the other incorrect.,"The parties were involved in an accident which occurred in the turning lane of a roadway. A tractor-trailer slowly inched up to a car driven by the plaintiff and nudged it causing damage to the back bumper, a slight denting on the trunk lid and some damage to tractor-unit. The ultimate disagreement was whether the defendant ought to have seen the plaintiff's vehicle in front of him and therefore, stopped his vehicle thus avoiding the collision. The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff. The physical evidence did not support either version of the facts put forth by the parties. HELD: The plaintiff’s claim was not dismissed.  1)The scales of justice were evenly balanced and the evidence was, at the end of the day, equivocal. The evidence could not support both versions of the events related to the court by the defendant and the plaintiff respectively. 2)The evidence was not equivocally supported either version the facts suggested by the plaintiffs or the defendant respectively. The psychological evidence did however support either versions of events related the court’d to the action by the defendants."

The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply abnormal obsolescence to the owner's property. The issues also relate to 15 other properties and as the issues are the same for each property they were decided by the Assessment Appeals Committee on one appeal. The Assessment Appeals Committee dismissed the appeals, finding the issue not to be a matter of the Assessor's Discretion but a matter of professional interpretation of data. The Committee found the Board of Revision did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err on the issue of abnormal obsolescence for size. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted on two questions of law.  1) Did the Committee err in its interpretation and application of the Saskatchewan Assessment Manual by failing to find that economic obsolescence for size must be categorized on a MAF by MAF basis? 2) Did the Committee err by failing to find the Assessor should have used the comparable unit method to determine whether an adjustment for obsolescence for size should be applied to the applicant's property? 3) On the use of invalid sales leave was denied on the basis the question of the sale is a question of fact and in argument the applicant said for its purposes the impugned sale did not matter. 4) Leave to appeal was denied on the issue of the standard of proof that there was no error demonstrated.","The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act.

Leave to appeal is denied. The Committee made no error and the issue has been decided by the Court; leave to appealed is denied on the basis the sale and the question of standard of proof are questions of law and not an appropriate method of assessment.

Leave was granted for leave on the question the sale did matter. The question of whether to be sufficiently meritorious to place before the Court either the judge hearing the application for leave must have a serious doubt about whether the tribunal appealed from correctly decided the question, or the question must be of such broad importance that it merits the attentionof and determination of a higher court irrespective of if the judge has any doubts about the accuracy of the Tribunal's resolution.[4]"

The issue is whether the plaintiff's claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act, and if so, whether the affidavit filed in support of the issuance of both of the pre-judgment garnishees complies with s. 3(2) of the Act. HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.  1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons. 2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand. Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement. 3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant. The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing. Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing.","FIAT.

5_2006nsca41.txt,"The plaintiff company commenced an action against a former employee/shareholder for breach of fiduciary and employee duty. The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company. The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action. The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","Electric Limited, one of the appellants, applied for an order permitting the appellant to withdraw his admissions and add a claim for an 'oppression remedy' pursuant to s. 5.03 of the Companies Act and for leave to the appellant, to commence derivative action. The appellant had previously been granted leave to amend his defence to include a claim regarding the retention of an accountant at the Company's expense and requiring disclosure to the accountant. The parties had reached an agreement whereby the appellant would commence derivative actions against the defendant. The defendant subsequently retained new counsel and the parties agreed to an amendment to the defence permitting the application to withdraw the admissions and for an opportunity to purchase the plaintiff. The new counsel sought to amend the defence to add a third defence and asserted that the appellant's rights as a shareholder were suspended by the consent order and not his rights as former shareholder. The dissenting counsel sought leave to appeal. Allowing the application dismissed as the appellant had not shown a material error of law or serious breach of the law by the appellant's application."
5_2006nssc43.txt,"The plaintiff alleged that a small piece of metal seen dangling from beneath the defendant's tractor trailer flew out from under the trailer as it passed the plaintiff's vehicle and hit her engine hood, bounced in the open window and caused her to lose control of her vehicle. She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control. The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled. Application for summary judgment granted; the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success. The plaintiff cannot resist a summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff's credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge.","The plaintiff was driving from Halifax to Seabright when an object fell off his vehicle and bounced on to the engine bonnet of her vehicle. She claimed damages for injuries to her arms, shoulders and neck. The defendant engaged two experts to examine the piece of metal and reported it did not come from the tractor-trailer. The experts concluded the piece had not flown from the truck and therefore there was no issue to be tried. The plaintiff applied to dismiss the action on the basis that the experts' reports did not show the piece was lodged in the truck. Dismissing the application, that the defendant met the threshold test in that it must meet a threshold test, namely that there is no material fact in issue, and must present evidence which lends some support to the claims it advances. The evidence from the accident reconstruction company and the experts who examined the piece did not support the bare allegation that the piece flew from the trailer. Furthermore, the plaintiff failed to adduce evidence supporting the bare allegations made in the pleadings."
5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drugs. The accused was found to have consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol content exceeded.08. The police officer made a blood sample demand and the accused was convicted. The defence raised a number of issues, including whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a blood demand pursuant to s. 254(3)(b) of the Code, whether the accused had reasonable or probable grounds for making such a demand, whether his condition was impracticable to the attending physician, whether he had reasonable custody of the accused and whether the Court had a duty to inquire into the medical condition of the person; whether the Crown had reasonable, probable grounds in the circumstances to make such a request; whether an accused was in care or control of the motor vehicle pursuant to the presumption in s. 258(1)(a); whether the court was entitled to remedy the exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis as it had found in R. v. Leedahl. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged. The Court found that the officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the victim and wisely waited until medical personnel made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. The totality of the evidence would lead any reasonable person to that conclusion. The court found that officer Kiesman had reasonable (and probable) grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impractic to obtain a sample. All of the requirements of s.254(3) have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt."
5_2008nssc113.txt,"The mother of two boys, ages 12 and 13, applied to vary access to add a condition that the father only be allowed to drive with the boys in the HRM, on roads with a speed limit of 80km/hr and under. She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party. Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work. She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","The father applied for a change to the Corollary Relief Judgment, alleging that the mother had denied him access and communication with his 3 and 12 year olds. He had been denied access for four years and had been using marijuana only three days a week. The father had been granted access for 12 months. He argued that his children would benefit from the access provided by the marijuana use and that there was no requirement for restriction upon his marijuana use in the Corllary Relief judgment. The assessor believed that the marijuana issue posed no risk to the children as the children had expressed their concern about his medical condition, his marijuana usage and his driving ability. Therefore, the father requested that all restrictions on his access be removed including the provision restricting his marijuana consumption to eight hours prior before driving. The mother objected to the restrictions because she believed they would result in potential harm to her children. The doctor confirmed that the evidence showed that the children would be able to drive safely on routes that permit speeds over 80 km/h if the drive was lengthy. The evidence showed the father was not seeking to alienate his children from him and that his use of marijuana was not a risk to his children."
5_2008skca56.txt,"The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment. The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and using a weapon, to wit a baseball bat, contrary to ss. 267(a) of the Code. He was tried by a jury, which convicted him. He appealed both his conviction and sentence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Court found that the appellant's testimony was not sufficiently inconsistent. 2) The Appeal Court distinguished between the testimony of Testimony-In-Chief and Cross Examination and its support by the evidence at the preliminary inquiry. 3) The appeal against conviction was dismissed. 4) The sentence was entirely correct to the circumstances of the case. The accused had not wavered in his allegation that the accused touched him sexually without his consent and that he struck him on the back three times with a baseball bats. 5) The accused would not have been able to identify the accused if he had been arrested in his home. The Court noted that the Crown's and the appellant’s witnesses were experts in the field of forensic evidence and were able to distinguish between the accused’ s and the defence’ss. 6) The charge that followed 2 days later was entirely incorrect to the situation of this case. 7) The evidence at trial was so extensive that the Appeal Court was unable to take its eyes off the case and were unable to determine its relevance. 8) The Crown’d been given two years less a day to appeal. The appeal was allowed in part because the Court found the Crown”s witnesses to be unreliable. 9) The court found that it was appropriate to set aside the sentence and allow the appeal in its entirety. 10) The issue of whether an appellate court can take into account the effect of sentence on deportation appeal rights has arisen before in Canada. The R. v. Leila case was one of those cases that would have been relevant but which were not decided on the basis of the evidence. 11) The defendant was found not guilty."
5_2009nssc218.txt,"The defendant was found guilty of attempted murder after he used a handgun to shoot the complainant outside a bar. He had a previous record for non-violent offences., defendant sentenced to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment; aggravating factors included the defendant's possession and use of a handgun in an area where a number of people were close by and that a bullet had found its way into a nearby residence.","The two accused were jointly charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in relation to shootings in the early morning hours of December 10, 2006. The accused had been acquitted of the first count of murder following a preliminary inquiry and remained in custody until October 2008 when they were released on judicial interim release under the Adult Bail Supervision Program. The court found that the two accused had a record of 17 months pre-trial custody while on remand, which included periods of curfew, a residency requirement and a requirement that he not attend certain areas in the municipality. The deceased had been shot in the leg and the accused was charged with attempted murder. The evidence in the present case points to the presence of at least 2, probably handguns being fired in the area where the victims were killed. HELD: A sentence of 9 years for each 10 months spent on remanded custody and a credit for time spent on pre- trial release for the firearm were appropriate. The offender was sentenced to a sentence of 10 years imprisonment with a credit of 9 months for time in pre-rial custody. The sentences were to be based on the facts of the case: the deceased had a previous criminal record for non-violent offences such as fraud, possession of a controlled substance and careless storage of a weapon; the deceased was found to have had one firearm at the time of the shooting and had one in his possession at the relevant time. The firearm was found in the deceased's vehicle and he was prohibited from leaving the area near the scene of the shootings. The victim had a Grade 10 education and had indicated an interest in upgrading his education. The shooter had a prior criminal record that included convictions for fraud, theft, possession a controlled firearm and careless storing of a gun. The defendant had a history of threatening other people and had a firearm while on bail. The Court found that it would appear that the accused had some mitigating factors to consider in order to reach a fit and proper sentence: the use of a firearm, the deceased, the threat to the safety and security of his community and the defendant's family were all at risk because of the presence and use of handguns. The case demonstrated that the presence in our community of illegal handguns and those who are prepared to use the handguns they carry regardless of the consequences to others are at high risk of violence and the offender possessed a high risk to himself and others due to the use and possession of firearms; the presence, if not the presence; of handguns in the community; the defendant was prohibited in his residence from"
5_2011nsca46.txt,"The defendant, who was found guilty of the careless use of a firearm, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace and possession of a restricted or prohibited firearm applied for bail pending appeal. He had been found, in his residence, with a firearm licensed in Alberta but not licensed to be brought into this province or possessed here. The defendant had residences in both Alberta and Nova Scotia but his Halifax residence was now up for sale and he travelled extensively around the world for his work. Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction. Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions. The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","The appellant was convicted of seven offences, including careless use of a firearm, pointing a firearm at a person, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public, possessionof a weapon at an unauthorized place (Criminal Code s.95(1)) and assault with a weapon (267(a)). He contended the trial judge erred in failing to find a breach of the Charter when the police entered the appellant’s condominium and failed to grant remedy; in failing not to find breach of a Charter when police entered his condominium; in making the appellant surrender his passport and in failing, in failing and in the manner in which he was required to surrender, the minimum sentence provisions of s. 95(1) were unconstitutional. The appellant appealed his convictions and sought interim release. He argued the trial court erred by failing to address the gravity of the offences, the seriousness of the charges, the principles of reviewability of convictions and the enforceability of the s.87(1)(a)(1) provisions. HELD: The appellant was released on terms and in writing on the condition that he surrender his firearm and passport, that he not engage in any dangerous or prohibited activity outside of Canada, that his arrest and detention were not necessary in the public interest and that his proposed release plan was wholly inadequate."

5_2014skca95.txt,"Civil Procedure – Appeal – Leave to AppealLand – Certificate of Pending Litigation The appellant sought leave to appeal the chambers decision not to vacate the certificate of pending litigation registered on behalf of her estranged husband, who was deceased. The respondent’s solicitors filed the certificate of pending litigation after his death. The appellant transferred the land subject to the certificate of pending litigation into her name only and entered into an agreement to sell the land, which could not proceed with the certificate of pending litigation. HELD: The appeal was of sufficient merit and it was not prima facie frivolous or vexatious. The appeal, however, was not found to be of sufficient importance to the practice of law or the Court of Queen’s Bench to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal. There was no new, controversial or unusual issue of practice raised by the appeal. The issues were determined to be better left for resolution by the Court of Queen’s Bench after hearing vive voce evidence at trial.","The applicant sought to appeal from a chambers judge's decision not to vacate a certificate of pending litigation registered on behalf of her estranged husband, who was deceased and his estate was represented by his executors. The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The applicant had not considered whether the chambers judge had exceeded his discretion in exercising his discretion within the criteria set out in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hamp; in Chambers. The judge had previously held that leave was not required. The court applied to review the chambers decision and to frame the grounds of appeal as falling within the adjudicative framework applicable to appeals from discretionary orders. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The proposed appeal did not raise a new or controversial or unusual issue of practice, nor did it raise a valid question of law based on the facts of this matter, it did not transcend the particular in its implications and it did have some merit. 2)The applicant did not bring a new and controversial or unorthodox issue of law or raise a particular question of fact. Nor did it have the potential to be a cause for concern. The proposed appeal would involve revisiting an interlocutory order that preserves the status quo pending final decision after trial. 3)The application for Leave to appeal could be interpreted as setting out two grounds of appeals that appear to allege the chambers court either committed an error in principle or disregarded material facts when he decided not to vacuum the certificates of pending lawsuit against the lands in question. However, the proposed appeal does not raise new or unusual or unsettled issues. Rather, it may raise a legitimate question of Law based on facts of fact, it does not bear heavily or potentially prejudiced the prospective outcome. 4)The Court was not prepared to accept a party's claim that the lands were sold for less than the cost of the certificate sale."

Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s. 15(1), 24(1) and 52(1)(b) of the Charter of Rights for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the rights of the applicant as guaranteed under s15 and s7 of the Canadian Charter of rights and Freedoms and that the applicants be reinstated as full time members of the respondent immediately and that pay to the applicants all compensation due to them as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest, and costs of the proceeding. In this case, the respondent's position was that the Snider decision did not apply and, in addition, the collective agreement did not permit the discrimination claimed. Dismissing the application, that s.15 of the charter does not reach private activity within a province and, therefore, is not likely to apply. In the area of private discrimination, an entirely new system of civil liability in competition with the dispute resolution mechanisms fostered by human rights legislation would result."

RCMP had investigated a tip that a large crop of marijuana plants was being grown on a private property located in a clearing off a woods road. They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants. At trial, the court held their right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure had been violated, and acquitted them. The Crown appealed the acquittal. Per Roscoe, J.A., Chipman, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that there was no s. 8 breach because the respondents did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the field where the marijuana crop was growing. The court reviewed case law regarding 'open fields', and 'uncultivated' lands, and adopted the reasoning in Oliver v. United States, 104 S.Ct.1735(1984) in reaching its conclusion. Per Pugsley, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that the respondents had a reasonable expectation of privacy in activities carried on by them on their private property. As there were no exigent circumstances, the search was not reasonable and the evidence should be excluded.","The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana and were acquitted on the basis of a voir dire held to determine the admissibility of evidence obtained by the police as a result of the seizure of 100 marijuana plants. The voir net was held to find whether the evidence should be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter or ordered by the Court of Appeal. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge erred in concluding that the evidence was not admissible. The trial judge's finding that the police had only a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched did not render the trial unfair. The evidence existed irrespective of the violation of the s. 8 Charter."
6_1996canlii6791.txt,"Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless. The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse. At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages. They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.","The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their two boys. The mother, who had been the mother's counsellor, and the father, who were both medical professionals, claimed that the mother, wife, and child and family counsellors (who had been hired by the father to libel the plaintiffs and wrest custody from the father) had wrongfully accused the children of physical and sexual abuse. HELD: The Court dismissed the application to vary the custodial arrangements and ordered the trial to take place in Unified Family Court. The Court held that the facts brought into conflict different fundamental societal interests: society's interest in the protection of children from abuse, society's Interest in the preservation of the good reputation of its members and society's interests in the fair and effective administration of justice. The following issues were examined: 1)Did the co-defendants collaterally libel the children; 2)Had the counsellori been properly trained and properly supervised, the Court would have dismissed the applications to vary custody; 3)Had there been any breach of the children's privacy, the evidence would have shown that the alleged abuses were not limited to the father's home; 4)The evidence would not have supported the allegations as they were based on allegations made against the father by the children themselves. The evidence would also have supported dismissal of the application."

He sought a declaration that a member of the police service must be informed of any investigation of his conduct prior to the commencement of the investigation as required by s.54 of the Police Act.; the Act does not permit the amendment in Form A discipline notice since it is a statutory form. The relief sought regarding disclosure had been abandoned by the applicant. The applicant argued that the fundamental questions to be addressed revolved around issues of statutory interpretation that must be resolved on a standard of correctness and the alternative remedies were not adequate. The respondent took the position that this Court should not entertain the application as there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act by way of appeal to the provincial Police Commission; that the Chief was entitled to amend the notice and would be entitled to grant leave if required; the hearing officer erred in holding that s.54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the subject member. HELD: The application was dismissed. There is an adequate alternative remedy which should be pursued. There were no 'special circumstances' upon which the court should exercise its discretion to determine the merits of the application.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of prohibition to prevent the respondent hearing officer, in his capacity as Hearing Officer under The Police Act, from proceeding with the hearing into the applicant's conduct pursuant to discipline charges brought against him by the respondent police chief. The respondent had refused to provide the applicant with a copy of the Form discipline notice. The applicant had taken objection to the prosecutor's request to amend the Form notice of the discipline offence with which he was charged and with the failure by the Chief of the Police to provide notice to Cst. Young of the Discipline proceedings as required by the Act. The hearing officer held that s. 42 of the Act provides a complete discretion to the Chief to amend charges without the need to obtain leave to do so from the hearing officer or, in the alternative, that the hearing hearing officer had the discretion to grant leave to amend and leave was granted. The appellant also sought a writ of prohibition preventing the respondent from proceeding in the hearing process. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court held that there was no evidence that the applicant’s right to fair hearing had been affected. 2)The alternative remedies were not adequate. 3)The convenience of the alternative remedy, the nature and extent of the error, and the appellate body (i.e., its investigatory, decision-making and remedial capacities) were considered. 4)The applicant was in good standing to file an appeal. 5)The court reviewed the relevant factors and concluded that the category of factors should be closed except for those in the context of the Court’ s natural justice jurisdiction. 6)The application was not allowed to proceed on its own. The court reviewed all the factors which should be considered in making the determination of whether or not an alternative remedy was adequate. 7)The procedural issues were resolved on a standard of correctness. 8)The issues were not likely to be resolved on appeal. 9)The respondent had not provided adequate notice of his investigation. 10)The factors set out in Selinger v. Ontario set out the factors to be considered. 11)The Supreme Court reviewed the factors in the decision of the respondent Hearing Officer in relation to the application of the applicant to the Saskatchewan Police Commission. 12)The Saskatchewan Police Department was in the position to determine the appropriate remedy. 13)The jurisdiction of the Saskatchewan Supreme Court was considered. 14)The appellant was awarded an alternative to the hearing in the form of a writ. 15)The parties were to"
6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT. The applicants, charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana, plead not guilty to the charges. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two provisions of the authorization: a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance and a search warrant authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. A search warrant to search the applicant's residence in April 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones. The Crown sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and a warrant excluded from trial and sought to set up a stay of proceedings on all charges. The applicant sought to use the provisions of s. 186(1)(a) of the Charter to set off the electronic surveillance. HELD: 1) Leave must be obtained to cross-examine. Leave must not be left to the exercise of the discretion of the trial judge. Leave should be left where the trial court is satisfied that cross-examination is necessary to enable the accused to make full answer and defence. As information obtained from the electronic monitoring was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant and the subsequent search warrant both of these warrants should be set aside on the basis they are derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful. 2) The authorization for surveillance should be put aside as information obtained through the electronic eavesdropping was utilized to obtain the video Surveillance warrant and both of them were a derivative of that authorization which was alleged to Begrand Fast. 3) The applicants seek to have all of the evidence obtain pursuant to these authorizations, authorize, and warrant excluded in trial and state it is also an appropriate case to direct a stay on all Charges against both applicants. 4) Leave to cross examine is not the general rule, it is justified in these circumstances in order to prevent an abuse of what is essentially a ruling on the admissibility of evidence. The 1993 amendments to s. 187 of the Code provide that evidence obtained at preliminary inquiry relevant to this application is admissible, subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence. 5) Leave should not be permitted to cross cross-amine in any event except in exceptional circumstances. Leave to re-examined the applicant pursuant to s.(1)(c) and (2) of s.(3) of this Code should not interfere with on appeal except in cases of a denial of a preliminary inquiry. Leave for leave to cross -examine should be permitted in any circumstances."
6_2003skqb170.txt,"The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity. The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal. Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.",The appellant was convicted of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. His sentence was suspended with a 1-year probation order. He appealed from the conviction. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The court found no error of law or miscarriage of justice as it was not necessary to substitute an acquittal for the conviction or a new conviction. 2)The trial judge erred in law by making findings of fact based on evidence that did not exist; 3)The judge failed to apply the appropriate test for a prima facie case of assault. 4)The fact that there were no photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of fact. No miscarriage ofjustice resulted.  5)The conviction was set aside and a fresh trial ordered on the ground that the trial judge failed in his test. 6)The Court was of the opinion that the error of laws was not applicable in this case.

I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'. He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them. [5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5. [6] We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access. The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise.

This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed. The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","The accused was charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The accused was found to be the driver. An approved screening device demand and a breath test demand resulted in an 'F' on the accused's breath. The officer noted an odour of liquor on the the accused’s breath, that her eyes were glossy, and her cheeks were flushed. The breath test result indicated that the accused had a blood Alcohol level of at least 100 milligram. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s258(1)(g) for the intended purpose of proving the accuseds blood alcohol levels. It indicated that both the accused and the technician had taken samples directly into an approved instrument. The certificate showed the accused blowing into something that she described as an “intoxilyzer”. The technician testified that she saw the accused blow the instrument into the device and it did not advance any of the other models that she had designated. She also testified that the device had a striking out of the word and symbol 'Breathalyzer®' and the writing in of the letter '2' was clearly made by the technician. The technicians did not specifically designate the approved instrument nor did they state in the certificate that it was an approved device. There was no evidence of the accused having any other symptoms of impairment. The Certificate of Analysis was dismissed."
6_2005nsca65.txt,"Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information. The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences. Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered. The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences. If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal.","The Crown appealed the acquittals entered by the Provincial Court judge on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons. The Information alleged that police officers who were in attendance at a residence as a result of a fire were advised by firefighters of two sawed off shotguns in the home. The defence argued that the notice of possession had been provided by the Crown in relation to the date of the offence, but the trial judge failed to prove that the date was not an essential element of the offense. The Crown appealed. Allowing the appeal, that the trial court erred by granting a directed verdict based on the discrepancy between the date the offences alleged in the Information and the evidence presented at trial because the evidence was not material with respect to (a) the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed, if it was proved the indictment was preferred within the prescribed period of limitation, if any; or (b) if the reason for the directed verdict was that it was too late to amend, that was a reversible error of law."

The parties have agreed to an order of joint custody with the child residing primarily with the petitioner. The petitioner wishes to move from Saskatoon to Edmonton. HELD: Based on the loss of the respondent as an active co-parent and the petitioner's vague and uncertain plans for the child's care in Edmonton, it is not in the best interests of the child that he be allowed to relocate to Edmonton with the petitioner.","The petitioner and the respondent are the parents of the child. The petitioner separated in October 2003. They agreed to an order of joint custody with the child primarily residing with the respondent. The respondent opposes the petitioner's move to Edmonton. The issues on the relocation are whether it is in the best interests of the baby to relocate to Edmonton with the petitioner; if so, what is an appropriate access schedule for the child to have with the applicant. HELD: 1) The respondent is the father of the children. The child has had his primary residence with the mother. The parties agree that the child should have as much contact with each parent as is consistent with the best interest of the party. The evidence on the respondent's concerns on the proposed relocation of the petitioner is that she has vague and uncertain plans for the future. The applicant's current access schedule is with the parties' child. 2) The petitioner has had her fair share of family events and activities in Saskatoon. The relationship with the Respondent and the child has been important to her. The Respondent's concerns about the respondent moving to Edmonton are minor and they are minor. However, based on the petitioner as an active co-parent and the applicant's vague and unclear plans for her child's care in Edmonton, it is not in the respondent’s best interests to allow her to relocate. 3) The applicant’ s position in Edmonton should be reviewed. 4) The Respondents’ position on the best Interest Test is limited to the best wishes of the parties. The court reviewed the best intentions of the Respondents and found that based on their loss of Harley as an access parent and Charlene’ll have access to the child on a consistent basis with the children’re best interests, the respondent should be allowed to relocate with the appellant to Edmonton, Alberta. 5) The court found that the respondent was not able to move with the baby because of the respondent and the petitioner’d vague and incomplete plans for their child. Based on the loss of the Harley as a participant in the child’S care in Saskat, the petitioner would lose contact with his extended family in Edmonton.  6) The Court reviewed the respondent in Edmonton and found it was not in their best interests for the respondent to relocate the child from Saskatoon to Edmonton and then to make an order for an interim access order. The Court allowed the respondent, who had a grade 12 education and a job in the business administration department, to move to Alberta with the"
6_2007nssc119.txt,"Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies. Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history. There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down. The mother now sought the return of both children. The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect. Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation. Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency. Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately. The mother continued to require professional intervention.","The issue in this case was whether the Agency failed to disclose relevant information to the petitioner and to the court. The petitioner had moved from Alberta to Nova Scotia and had been placed in the supervised care of her common law partner. The respondent had previously been granted custody of the children, but had since moved to Nova Scotia. The children had been in the petitioner's home for several months and had not been able to attend school or school activities for several years. Upon the petitioner’s application for a protection order from Nova Scotia, the Agency requested to have it dismissed as the evidence showed that the petitioner had not made proper arrangements for the children to live with her mother. The applicant also alleged that the child protection concerns had been raised at a previous risk conference and that the respondent had refused to provide the children with the mother. HELD: 1)The petitioner”s evidence was that the children had not lived with the respondent for some time and that he had verbally and physically abused them. The evidence did not support the petitioner having agreed to return to Nova Southeastern to live in a permanent home with her father. The court found that the evidence did support the respondent” s position that once the children were placed in a home with the petitioner, they would no longer be children in need of protective services. The concerns regarding the petitioner were not raised at the risk conference. The child protection files were not prepared for the court to review and become familiar with.  2)The court found it necessary to have the information disclosed to the parties as a result of the petitioner not having been properly informed of the child’d protection history. The information was not relevant to the disposition of the three children. The parties” were not required to participate in any disposition review. 3)The evidence did contribute, but not in the way that the information should have been disclosed to other parties. The administration of the legislation supported the presumption that protection against the petitioner should be reserved for the parents of children who are already in the home. The preservation of the evidence would not be in the best interests of the public if the information was disclosed to them. 4)The children were adopted and placed in foster care with the common law spouse. The parents were to have their children placed in supervised care with their father. 5)The respondent was to assume sole responsibility for the three youngest children."

6_2008skca156.txt,"The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","The Crown appealed a Provincial Court judge's finding that the respondent was unfit to stand trial for offences committed in 2006. The Crown contended the judge misapprehended the evidence, misstated the evidence and applied the wrong legal test for fitness, applied the incorrect burden of proof and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal allowed. The limited cognitive capacity test (LGB) test is a valid form of instruction in that it requires an accused to be capable of reason, reason, conduct and protection. The respondent was found unfit to sit trial because he displayed signs of attention deficit disorder and attention deficit disorders. The trial judge also failed to apply the wrong test for integrity, common sense, or lack of insight. The Court held that the appellant had not shown that he could effectively instruct counsel in the course of the trial. The court adopted the higher threshold threshold for fitness for fitness (including best interests) as suggested by the Ontario Court of Appeal. The test was not modified as suggested. The limitation of the limited cognitive ability test strikes an effective balance between the objectives of the fitness rules and the constitutional right of the accused to choose his own defence and to have a trial within a reasonable time. The adoption of a higher threshold for unfit to continue standing is not intended to displace the presumption of innocence to which he remains entitled."

M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code. After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions. HELD: The accused is sentenced to 9 months incarceration. Pursuant to s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code, a firearm order was made for 10 years prohibiting the accused from possessing any type of weapon. The accused shall also supply a sample of his DNA for analysis. There is an order under s. 490.012(1) that the accused comply with the Sexual Offender Information Registration Act. The accused is also prohibited, pursuant to an order under s. 161(1)(a), from attending a public park or swimming area where persons under the age of 14 years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, day care centre, school ground, playground or community centre for a period of 3 years.","The 37 year old accused was convicted of sexually touching a person under the age of 14 years, contrary to s. 151(1) of the Criminal Code. He had been in a residential school for three and one-half years and had previously been convicted of sexual assault. He lived with his step-grandmother (a.M.) for some time. He was in a transitional program and had been involved in several programs with his mother. The accused had a previous criminal record, which included convictions for trafficking, assault, sexual touching, and possession of drugs. The Crown requested a s. 490.012 of the Code prohibiting S.C. from engaging in certain employment involving positions of trust or authority towards persons under the ages of 14 and prohibiting him from attending certain places as provided for by s. 161 of the code. The defence argued that this was an offence to which s. 718.01 of the Criminal Code applies and a mandatory prohibition order would issue prohibiting S.,C.from possessing firearms, cross-bow, prohibited weapon, prohibited device, prohibited firearm, and explosive substance during the period of his incarceration and, subsequently, this probation order. HELD: The sentence of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute was determined to be 10 years less a day. The maximum sentence of incarceration was 10 years. The court ordered that S. C. comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (S.O.R. 2004) and the Sex offender Information Registration Authority (SORA) for a period of 10 years, assuming he had completed high school and was working in a program or treatment facility. S.T. would not give just cause for dismissal from the SPRA. SIN: The SPRA was not available in this case. The SPRI was not an appropriate sentence as S.D. did not have any significant or related criminal record and had not previously served time in jail. The terms of his probation order and his sentence were both set out in s.718.1 of the CODE. The order that S.,c. comply comply with S.O.(R. and the sex offender registries) would be in the range of between 6 to 9 months. The SHSPRI was an appropriate punishment as S., C.E. and A.M. did have a significant educational and vocational education and had a high school education. The SpRA was an approved program for youth. The SSPRI did not provide a specific time period for S.Cs. to"
6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff purchased a home in 1998. She engaged the services of a defendant realtor who had been previously employed by the plaintiff company, 100% Realty. After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased the property in 1999.

She claimed aggravated damages against the defendants and punitive damages against them for failing to inform her that the home had been moved over 300 kilometres from its original building site. The offer of recovery for alleged latent defects was rejected by the defendants. The plaintiff sued the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged defective roofs. HELD: The plaintiff sues the defendants for recovery of $250,000 for alleged defects in the roof. The Court ordered the payment of $150,000 as realtor's fee. The defendant was found to have violated the terms of the contract by failing to disclose any of the alleged defects. The court ordered the defendant to pay $285,000 to have the roof replaced or replaced with a comparable building permit.

The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","The plaintiff, Sierra Forestry, moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it pursuant to Rule 44.10(b) of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The plaintiff sought a change of place of the proceeding, from Halifax to Windsor, in the area where the dispute arose. The defendant, SED, argued the attachment order had hindered or prevented its operations. SED brought a motion to terminate the attachment ordered pursuant to Rules 49.01 and 49.02 of the Rules and added that the mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants was not sufficient reason to dispose of the corporate veil. SIRD awarded costs of $1,000 payable in any event in the cause. SELD awarded costs to the applicant of $2,000 in any way in the causes.  1) The plaintiff did not establish that it attempted to frustrate the course of justice as it did not have a stated purpose under Rule 44.(1)(b). The mere allegation was not enough reason to displace the corporate cover. 2) The affidavit did not properly incorporate the contents of the statement of claim. The mere allegations of a link between the individuals and corporate defendant was not a sufficient reason for the maintenance of the attachment Order.  3) The applicant did not demonstrate a principled basis to justify the maintenance. 4) The mere assertion of a possible connection between SED and the plaintiff's company was not grounds for the attachment.  5) The court did not find that SED had established any of the grounds available under Rule 40.01(b)(c) or Rule 44(2) of The Civil Procedure Rule (1972) which required the applicant to establish facts, not allegations or suspicions."

Held, motion dismissed. Under Rule 14.01, the motions judge must decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. The party seeking production must establish relevance. Here, the only evidence was regarding the occurrence of the fires; there was no evidence as to the manner of the defendant's operation of the business in the second location that would establish relevance to the action regarding the first location. The commonality of a fire in separate buildings two years apart does not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating to the second fire.","The defendant operated out of a leased premises in the plaintiff's building two years apart.

In January of 2014, the petitioner filed an application for interim spousal support retroactive to the date of separation.

Brackley, 1999 CanLII 715 (SCC), the court applies the SAGE as a guide only and orders the respondent to pay interim spousousal assistance in the amount of $700.00 per month beginning November 1, 2013 and continuing until October 22, 2013 until further order of the court. The petitioner, having been the successful applicant, shall have her costs fixed at $1,200.00, payable by the respondent, at $2,200, payable at the respondent. 2) Following Lapp v. Lapp, the Court does not grant retroactive spousol support prior to the respondent being put on effective notice that the petitioner was now seeking spousAL support. At the respondent's age and given his state of health, the courts will not compel the respondent by attributing to him an income which is based upon significant overtime income. At 61 years old, the petitioner did not seek any form of corollary relief pursuant to the provisions OF the Diva Act or under the Family Maintenance Act. Nor did the petitioner seek spousala support under the provisions Of The Family Maintenance act, 1997. 3) Following a review of the provisions in the DivDivorce Act, the Supreme court adopted the rule that retroactive child support preceding commencement of the proceedings ought not to be granted in an application for interim support. The court awarded interim spouse support in the sum of $7,540.00 (on the first day of each and every month thereafter until further court order) and ordered the respondent not to exceed $1 million (on an interim basis) in monthly spousaling support."

Awarding the plaintiff $21,000 for future pecuniary loss, that his employment opportunities were less now than before the accident and he was entitled to lump sum compensation. No weight was given to the plaintiffs actuarial report since there was no history of income and no evidence of projected income from the family hotel business in which the plaintiff was expected to continue. Non-pecuniary damages of $41,000 were awarded.","The plaintiff suffered a posterior dislocation of his right hip, a compound injury involving his right knee with a disruption of the medial collateral ligament and a fracture of his third right metacarpal in the hand.

He resumed his normal daily activities and was able to participate in various sports including baseball, soccer and lacrosse. He lived in poverty and suffered from severe back pain. The plaintiff sought to recover his lost income from the insurance policy and sought damages for loss of earning capacity and restriction in his ability to participate actively in sports. Awarding $21,000 with prejudgment interest. The court found that this was not a case where evidence of future income was adduced showing a history of income and the interference in that income capacity due to the injuries. To succeed in this cause, the court required a lump sum of $41,000 from which there was no entitlement to prejudgment interests."

7_2010nsca95.txt,"The first defendant was the lessee and driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the plaintiff. The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the plaintiff. The Chambers judge found that there was no real chance of success on the arguments advanced by the respondent respecting Chrysler's alleged liability by operation of the Motor Vehicle Act. The issue was whether the Chambers judge erred in determining that the action against Chrysler had no reasonable chance of succeed. The issues were whether the law of vicarious liability extended to leasing companies, whether Chrysler was in the business of renting cars, and whether the Law of Conduct was appropriate. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The court found that s. 248 has no application on the facts of this case.  1) The Chambers decision did not err in determining there were no material facts in dispute. The lease agreement did not fall within the type of rental agreement contemplated by s. 62 of the Act. 2) The evidence raised by the parties was that the lease agreement between the appellant and Chrysler had none of the characteristics of a rental agreement as contemplated by the Motor Vehicles Act. 3) The reverse onus provision did not apply.  4) The issue had no application to the appellant. The evidence did not support the conclusion that the leasing agreement had a real chance to succeed.  5) The lease fell into the 'lease with right of purchase' exception to the definition of owner.  6) The appeal turned on the interpretation of two provisions of the Vehicle Act, s. 2(ak) and s.2(ak). The lease contains the characteristics noted in s. 1(ak); it cannot realistically be depicted as a rental contract as defined in s 62. Further support for Bazley was found in s61, which falls under the heading of 'For Rent Cars'."
7_2011nspc27.txt,"The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery. A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","The accused, a young person, was arrested after police stopped a car suspected of being involved in a robbery with a firearm at a specific address in Sackville. The police found a gun and a ring in the back seat of the car. The accused had been picked up in Fairview and two young men had been in the car when it was stopped. HELD: The accused was found in the vehicle with the gun and the ring in it. The circumstantial evidence did not support the inference that the accused was the person involved in the robbery. The court found that the circumstances in which the accused, who was sitting in the driver's seat, were more than suspicious. The evidence of the accused's involvement would have to be so strong that it would allow the inference to be made that the person who was in the driving seat was the one who was involved. The case law was not changed. The Crown did not prove the accused drove the car as it was being stopped. The Court found that although the accused had not been at the scene of the robbery, she was in it with the three young men and that the Crown witnesses were all there. The only conclusion drawn was that the police were not looking for the accused and that he was not the only person who had been there when the robbery took place. The fact that the crime was committed against a young man who was not sitting on the bench and did not have a direct drive from the address in the courtroom to the place on Northwest Arm Drive where the car was stopped, raised a reasonable question as to whether the accused knew where he was and whether he was committing the offence."

HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.",The defendant was granted a summons to argue a portion of the 18 claims submitted by the plaintiff. The defendant was not issued a summons and the matter was directed to a Provincial Court Judge. The judge was away for two weeks on education leave and will be returning to meet with the plaintiff on the issues. The issues raised by the claims were important issues to the potential plaintiffs. They asked that the judge issue a summons pursuant to s. 7(4) of The Small Claims Act to testify at a hearing on the claims. The Judge refused to issue the summons and instead issued a Supplementary Interim Ruling. The Court held that the Supplementary Intermediate Ruling was not the proper way to deal with the issues at this time. The summons was issued to the defendant and the parties were to appear at a pre-hearing conference to determine if a resolution was possible outside the Courtroom. The defendants should not have to defend a case where nothing is averred against them.

The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012. The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew. Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved. This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial? HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act. With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action. As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it. Since the parties had given notice that they wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case, the Court ordered that the deponents be produced for the purpose of cross-examination.","FIAT: The plaintiffs commenced their statement of claim under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Saskatchewan on April 27, 2009. Their claim is with respect to a construction residential contract of purchase and sale. The defendant corporation withdrew and Orion Morgan, president of the defendant corporation, asked for an adjournment of the simplified trial which was granted on May 2, 2012. Orion Morgan was then permitted to represent the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs then asked for the return of their deposit of $25,000 and the costs of plans that were prepared for them at cost of $3,533.25. At that time, the dissolved corporation advised counsel for the plaintiffs and with the court that his corporation had recently been dissolved. Counsel for the plaintiff then filed a brief of law opposing the application to have Morgan's affidavit accepted. At issue was whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear the simplified trials and if so, what the appropriate process was during the simplified. HELD: 1) The simplified trial should proceed as if the corporation was dissolved and Orion was allowed to represent it. Orion was to be produced for the purpose of cross- examination. 2) The Court was aware that there is a case law authority that has found contrary interpretation to similar provisions in other provinces. 3) The court was not prepared to follow the decisions of the Part 40 simplified trial but to follow other case law that supports the interpretation of s. 219 of The Business Corporations Act.

7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The Court of Appeal upheld the sentence of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge for the offence of unlawfully trafficking in forest products. The Court found that, after considering all of the evidence, it was not satisfied that a fine of $2,000, with a40% surtax was an unreasonably low penalty for the offences the Court established. The Crown appealed the sentence. The issues were as follows: 1) could the defendant be found guilty of illegally harvesting forest products? 2) can the defendant lawfully trafficking forest products pursuant to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act? HELD: 1). The defendant was found not guilty on count 1 of unlawfully harvesting forest product and count 2 of unlawfully possessing forest products but the Court found it was unlikely that the defendant would have been found guilty on the trafficking charge. The defendant sold wood to an undercover officer for $1.5, which was an amount that was accepted. The evidence of the conservation officers was uncontradicted. 2) The defendant harvested wood from Crown lands and used wood to heat his own home and heat the wood at his brother’s residence. The statement made by the defendant that he obtained his wood from crown lands was sufficiently ambiguous that the Court should not have taken this as an admission, proving beyond a reasonable doubt, that the wood comprising the 150 truckloads and 58 truckloads or the three cords sold to him came from Crown land. 3) if there was no evidence he unlawfully harvested wood or unlawfully possessed wood, how could he be found found guilty?"
7_2015skqb352.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – Best Interests of ChildFamily Law – Custody and Access – Interim – VariationFamily Law – DivorceFamily Law – Evidence – AffidavitThe parties were in a high-conflict situation and brought five interim applications with various requests. They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","HELD: The application was granted. The judgment was granted and the matter of increasing parenting time proceeded to a pre-trial conference, even an expedited pre- trial conference. The court found no reason to deny the application. The child was already enrolled in a Montessori program when the original order was made. There was no reason for the court to delay the trial or to make any further decisions. The matter was resolved prior to the matter coming to chambers. The fact it continued to be argued in chambers is perhaps more reflection of the lack of communication between the parties than any real issue surrounding this part of the child."

7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in the insurance premium surpluses was who was entitled to the money. Empire Life Insurance claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the insurer whose lives were insured over the years under the Policy. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be made. HELD: 1)The insurer will have the court determine, on this application, that it alone is entitled to payment of the funds in question. The argument that any monies received by Ag Credit are 'public money' within the meaning of the Financial Administration Act, 1993, they are also therefore 'public Money' under Ag Credit's Act and thus Crown property for the present purposes is non-sequitur. 2)The only conclusion drawn was that the insurer had acted in full compliance with its duty of uberrima fides in bringing the potentially valid claims of the insured clients to the attention of the Court and in resisting the claim by Ag credit to pay the full monthly premium surplus of $3,552,881.00 which was paid directly to the insurer from the date of the Policy termination to January 1, 2015 when Ag Credit terminated the policy. 3)The insurance policy and predecessor polices contained provisions for so-called 'Experience Credits'.

In 1989 the vessel was in Halifax at the end of the Marblehead race. In August 1990 an assessment of $195,785.90 was made against the respondent because the vessel had been registered in Nova Scotia and had been used in the province. Notice of objection was filed and eventually the matter came before the N.S. Tax Review Board, which concluded that the vessel did not have a sufficient presence in the Province to attract tax under s. 7(1) of the Act. Dismissing the appeal, that s. 2(4) of The Health Services Tax Act applies to all aircraft and parts brought into the province, and only in respect of flights between the province and the Carribean. It does not give the aircraft situs there to support tax which constitutionally must be 'within the Province'. In the case of aircraft operations, there must be substantial, at least more than nominal, presence in order to provide a basis for imposing tax in respect the entry of aircraft into the Province."" In Canadian Pacific Airlines Ltd. v. British Columbia, 1989 CanLII 94 (SCC), 59 D.L.R. (4th) 218 the Supreme Court of Canada had to consider whether the Social Services Tax (S.T.A.) Act applied to aircraft. The case turned on whether the provision applied to the vessel. The administration of tax in Nova Scotia was based on the assumption that the tax would apply to all airline aircraft. In addition, the Department of Finance had some legislative jurisdiction in the air space above it so that the pivotal question was whether the entry into the provincial plane of the respondent was 'within' the province so that tax would be imposed on them. The appeal was dismissed without costs."

It is an extraordinary remedy to be granted only where serious and urgent circumstances indicate a need for prompt action to protect the victim. 2)Absent such urgency, the application should be one for a 'victim's assistance order' brought to a Queen's Bench Judge in Chambers under s.7 in accordance with The Queen's Bench Rules. 3)In this case the domestic violence complained of occurred on January 28. There was no evidence that on February 1, 1995, Dolgopol was at risk of immediate harm.

There was enough reliable evidence (theoretically) to support the conclusion that the respondent was selling drugs or that this was a continuing activity and that it was on-going at the date of the application. There were at least three concerns to be addressed in weighing evidence relied on by the police to justify a warrantless search. 1)The evidence was compelling. The progression of dates in each succeeding paragraph of the Information confirmed that the applicant was selling marijuana. The graph of dates at each succeeding page of the information confirmed that this would be the year the application was made. The analyst had no notes regarding the contacts referred to in his Information and relied on receipts from paid informants to remember relevant dates. Now notes were kept. The officer confirmed that he had not spoken personally to the Justice prior to making the decision to conduct the search. 2)There was sufficient evidence to support a warrant. The fact that the application had been granted by a judge standing in the same place and function as the authorizing judge was compelling enough that it warranted a review. The court found that there was sufficient reliability evidence to justify the warrant and that the reasonsableness test was applied."

They also agree that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause. It is clear that the subject matter of the clause is a 'Participating Interest in the Program Land or a Project Area'. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement. However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole. Accordingly, the voting agreement is not caught by subsection 14.01.","The parties entered into a joint venture agreement (JV) whereby they were to sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of their Participating Interest. The voting agreement secured the follow up steps under the original commitment by Kensington which would be implemented over a lengthy period of time.

They took the position that they had exercised their right to vote by entering into the voting agreement, rather than having sold their vote by so doing. Theoting agreement secured follow up step under the Kenswell plan which would take place over a longer period of times and more rapidly and proceeding in different directions. The Respondents and Cameco preferred the KZL plan and had committed themselves to It. They also took the positions that they exercised their rights by entering the voting power by entering in the voting Agreement, rather rather having sold your vote by doing. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The words in parenthesis, rather being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture and their inability to dispose of them qua non negotiable interest. Thus, the phrase 'participating interest in the program lands or project area' is a mere phrase and not a substantive provision in the meaning of the word 'rights' in theJV agreement. 2)Ssection 14.01, with the words in the parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. The words in this parenthesis (rather than being intended in parenthetical form) were intended to recall the parties' dedication of their assets to and their failure to dispose them quas non negotiable interest. 3)The phrase 'Participating Interest in the Program Lands or Project Area' does not constitute a substantive right of refusal. Section 14.02, with respect to the words 'rights in parentheses' creates a right of second refusal.

These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant. The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years. The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars. There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years). While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant. There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay. After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here. On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice. There is a significant documentary record of the transactions. The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner. The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time. While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice. Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","The plaintiffs filed an Originating Notice and Statement of Claim in 2000. They claimed that the defendant RBC caused them to suffer losses on investments. The defendant solicitor, who was no longer employed by the plaintiff, advised them to buy stock in the companies and provided information about available gold was misleading. The plaintiffs applied to dismiss the action on the basis that RBC had refused to provide them with information about the companies that was not communicated to the plaintiffs. RBC appealed the dismissal of the action. Allowing the application and ordering the return of the matter to trial, that R.BC was responsible for a considerable period of delay and that R.(R) acquiesced to a slow tempo of litigation. The presence or absence of RBC's actions may be relevant in determining whether the delay is inordinate. On the issue of whether R.O. has suffered undue delay, R.B. must show that it is not seeking to delay litigation but rather acquiescing to a slower tempo of protracted litigation. R.A. must demonstrate that it has not caused the plaintiffs to suffer serious prejudice. The delay is entirely due to the negligence of the plaintiff's solicitor and the plaintiff himself is blameless. R.(ii) the delay of attributable to the plaintiff is of 8 years, which is inordinately high for an inordinate period of time in which to bring a case to trial. R(iii) the action was responsible, as it was, for an inexcusable delay. There can be no injustice in bearing the consequences of his own fault. (iv) the delays are entirely due in part to RBC failing to properly supervise and supervise the plaintiff solicitor and his failure to properly advise and supervire the plaintiff. R&D costs in the amount of $60,000 to the defendant and are inordinate in the manner of $100,000 for an application to compel production of R. O.L.

The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The petitioner was granted interim shared custody with the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month in child support and ordered to have his child in the interim care of his mother.

The applicant also submitted that the respondent had verbally abused and pestered her for several days. The parties had reconciled but then resorted to communicating exclusively via text messages. The evidence showed that the petitioner was concerned that the parties were holding the child from her and that the child had been kept from her. She decided to end the relationship. The interim arrangement was ordered that the two parties have one child, Z. The child would be in the custody of the petitioner and the respondent would receive parenting time. The mother was to have the child in interim care with her son to come pick up the parties from their house. The father was to pay child support for the petitioner until trial could be held. The children would be able to spend some time with the father. The parents were to have a shared parenting time with Z. After the pre-trial conference was held, the petitioner separated from the respondent who had been paying child support. The two parties then resorted by text message to the applicant. The essence of the communication was to try and get the child out of the relationship and to have him in the permanent care of the mother so that he could spend some quality time with his new family. The message was that the parents would be better served by having the child live with the petitioner rather than with the husband. The husband was to provide the child with a home and the child was to bring the child to the parties' house so that they could spend quality time together. The wife was to receive the child's birthday and the parties had discussed the child having a party. The son had not seen his mother for three months and had not been seen by his father for three weeks. The relationship had lasted less than a year. The issues between the parties was complex and the father was prone to anger and was prone in some cases to calling the mother to complain. The court had no authority to direct the parties to an expedited pre- trial conference. The family had been locked out for several years and had been trying to reconcile. The last two years have been difficult for the parties because of the numerous moves, changes in circumstances, changes to the child and the absence of a child. The current interim"
8_2017skqb249.txt,"HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel had constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The dispute concerned the exclusive right of the respondent to market, licence and distribute HAL's products. The respondent wanted to have the exclusive rights to market and distribute the products in Canada. Accordingly, the parties entered into three separate contracts in 2008 and in 2012, the two parties entered a software customization agreement (IDSL) and the Escrow and Software Modification Agreement (ESMA). These contracts each provided that any disputes which could not be resolved by the parties could be settled by binding arbitration. The agreements between HAL & Securtek contain an implied condition that permits the parties to appeal an arbitrators' decision on a question of law, notwithstanding the absence of such provision in the agreements. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The language of the agreements was so clear with respect to the arbitration clauses and their finality that it cannot be overridden by vagueness or inadvertent omission. The intention expressed in the arbitration clause of the agreement was clear and it would take an equally clear statement to convey different intention. 2)Leave to appeal on a questions of law simply does not fall into the category of the obvious or something that 'it goes without saying' in the factual matrix of this case. Such an implied term is not akin, for instance, to the implied term of good faith in contractual negotiation, or the implied terms of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment. The terms of the Agreement, which contain the clauses relating to the minimum sales target and the maximum number of licences, are clearly meant to give business efficacy to the contract. The intent expressed in these arbitration clauses is clear and is clearly articulated. 3)Leave is not an option in this case, as the parties clearly intended to have it continue. The parties clearly had no intention to permit an appeal on that basis. 4)Leave must be inferred from the meaning of the word 'final and binding' (HAL). The parties referred to one, and only one, specific instance in which an appeal would be permissible. The absence of reference to any other circumstances in which appeal would possibly be permitted was intentional. The degree of generality (precedential value) of the spoken language reflects the fact that the parties referred only to one and only such an instance in a specific set of circumstances. The more narrow the rule, the less useful it is to limit the intervention of the court"

The court found that the judgment should be set aside as a matter of right because it was in excess of the amount due. The judgment was also set aside on the merits. It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action. As well, the defendant had provided an arguable defence to the claim in that it pled in its proposed defence of non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act. The delay had not caused the plaintiff irreparable harm.","Civil Procedure – Default Judgment – AppealHELD: Pursuant to Rule 10-13 of The Queen's Bench Rules, Key's counsel applies to set aside the default judgment and seeks leave to file a defence. The plaintiff obtained default judgment against the defendant, The Key First Nation, totalling $102,703.62 plus costs of $1,598.50. Pursuance of Rule 10,13, and Rule 10 of the Rules, the plaintiff applies to have the default judgement set aside because Sollows' counsel has not demonstrated an arguable defence to the claim. HELD: The default judgment is set aside. 1) The plaintiff is entitled to have his default judgment set aside on its merits. 2) In exercising judicial discretion under Rule 10 and Rule 11 of the Rule 10/13, the court must also conclude that the plaintiff is, in exercising judicial discretionary under Rule 9-13, entitled to this judgment on its own merits. 3) In exercise of judicial discretion, the Court must also decide on the merits whether or not an individual has the ostensible authority to bind the plaintiff and to whom. 4) In this case, Sollow's counsel demonstrated an'arguable' defence to Key's claim. The delay has not caused Sollow’s irreparable harm, and Key has demonstrated an argumentative defence to Sollowsa’ claim.  5) The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found no merit in the submission that SollowS had calculated interest too high because of 'rounding error'. Per diem rates ought to be stated in dollars and cents. Per diems of $8.54 are overcharge of $17.08. 6) The time frame from March 2016 to March 2018 is a total of 723 days, not 725 days.

Awarding 5 months interest, that the date from which interest is calculated in this type of action is upon completion of the appeal process. An appropriate interest claim under s. 41(I) therefore only exists for the five month period between the Court of Appeal's assessment determination and the refund of the property tax five months later.","The plaintiff municipal tax payer paid its property taxes as assessed for the years 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 but on appeal was held entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total of $420,177.13.  The plaintiff sought interest pursuant to s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra on the refund from the date it made the overpayments in response to HRM's tax invoices requiring payment of those amounts on the due dates.

Awarding a refund of overpaid taxes to the plaintiff was not an appropriate interest claim.

9_2000skca87.txt,"An appeal under s.33.1 of the Municipal Board Act from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board, one in a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor (MAF) to assessments for municipal tax purposes. In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed. Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision. The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case. The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.  4)There was no order as to costs as success was divided.","The appellant appealed a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board which held that the use of the MAF to be used in calculating the assessed value of a shopping centre was justified.

Eaton v. City of Saskatoon; and created as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire City of Saskatchewan. HELD: The appeal was allowed on a basis of the same grounds as the grounds of appeal in Cadillac. 1)The decision was arrived at not as a result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but as a consequence of the appellant's failure to establish to the satisfaction of the committee the facts on which it based its case.  2)The issues raised by the appellant in this appeal were exactly same as the issues dealt with at the time of the addition of the Midtown plaza in Saskatoons. The appeal must be allowed on that basis in respect to the use in conjunction with the Cadillac Fairviews v. city of Saskatoon. The same reasoning applies in Cadillac and the similar judgment."

Accused not guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The confrontation between the accused and the complainant was one continuing episodic event and the complainant's actions were provoked by the accused. However, no causal relationship was shown between the blows of the accused and the broken nose sustained by the complainant.

The police arrested and charged the accused with assault causing bodily harm. The Court found that the accused cannot rely on the Criminal Code s.34(1) for his defence. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that on the evidence the accused had no reasonable apprehension of bodily harm or of the possibility that he would cause death or bodily harm to the complainant. The evidence suggested that the complainant was afraid of the accused because of some continuing violent act on the part of the complainant towards him.

It is uncontroverted that Brina has disabilities that necessitate certain tools such as a computer for her to be successful in her post-secondary training. HELD: 1) The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses and there shall be an order accordingly. 2) The September 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in Brina's s. 7 expenses. Accordingly the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s. 7 costs. 2) The crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred on Brina's part and will assist her with her future plans. 3) The Zeller's supplies would normally be covered under the Table support and that expense is disallowed. 4) Brina's s. 7 post-secondary expenses are $7,123.72 and include tuition, crisis prevention class and books, required university books, bus pass, black cartridge for the printer, Shaw internet, Microsoft licence, computer repairs and updated virus protection.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to have arrears fixed with regard to s. expenses related to her daughter's post-secondary education and in addition requests that the amount of the ongoing s. costs be fixed.

There were four grounds of appeal: 1) an application to admit new evidence on appeal; 2) a constitutional challenge seeking a declaration that the bylaw was ultra vires for uncertainty; 3) the significance of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw; and 4) the meaning of the word 'livestock' in the bylaw. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) New evidence will not be admitted on an appeal if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial. Further, new evidence will be admitted only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial. Neither of these requirements is met. 2) The constitutional challenge is not properly before the Court as notice is required when the constitutionality of a bylaw is impugned. In any event, the uncertainty on which the appellants rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist. 3) The appellants misunderstand the use of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw. 4) Whatever definition of 'livestock' is used, the definition always includes cattle.","At a June 2, 2006 trial in Provincial Court, the appellants were found guilty of breaching a bylaw of the Rural Municipality of Vanscoy No.345. The trial justice convicted the appellors of breaching Bylaw 2-1995, which provides that no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned hamlet. The appellants did not lead evidence at trial. They did not dispute that they were keeping cattle on their property. Their defence related to points of law. HELD: The application to admit new evidence was dismissed. 1)The appellants' use of the word 'hamlet' in Bylaws 2-1993 and 1-1998 does not bear upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue at trial, since the use of that word bylaws in Byleaw 2‑1995 does not refer to a particular type of livestock. The meaning of the term 'livestock' in the bylaw is uncertain. 2)The uncertainty on which the appellant rely in attacking the bylaws does not exist. The letter from Saskatchewan Government Relations and Aboriginal Affairs did not bear on a decisive issue. The references to proposed amendments in the letter would not establish that there had been any amendments. 3)The use of a word 'liveste' in a zoning bylaw does not mean 'hamlete' since it does not reference livestock. To the extent that the zoning bylaw refers to an operation relating to keeping livestock, 'liveness' includes cattle. The amendments address other topics. 4)The application to add new evidence on the appeal was dismissed because the uncertainty on the appellation's arguments on the merits did not exist under BylAW 2-95. The parties did not tender any copies of the bylaws they sought to amend. The label given to zoning district is significant only as an aid to determining those parts of the Bylaws that set out the rules governing that particular district. The labels given to bylaws (bylaws and bylaws) do not communicate the particular documents that are being requested. The names of the parties and the by-laws they asked to be added to the byllaw do not refer specifically to livestock. 5)The bylaw's relevance to the issues at trial was not clear. The bylaw did not reference 'hamlets' in its relevant sense. The designation of a subdivision bylaw (bylaw) does not serve as a decisive and potentially decisive Issue at the trial. The Bylaw does reference a subdivision under the Rural municipality Act, 1989"

Application to strike affidavits dismissed; the Rules do not preclude the admission of affidavits on an application and, in the present circumstances, reason and fairness militated against ruling the affidavits inadmissible.

The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother.

The only issue was access. The trial judge found that the child was to have his access for the remainder of August, in accordance to the terms of the new trial judge. The child was also to have access with his mother.

The formal contract did not expressly set forth these conditions. Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.  4)Farr took a calculated risk and sold the seed which alleviated his immediate cash-flow problem. Johnson Seeds waited until the last possible day under the written contract terms to call the contract in an effort to position itself to claim increased damages for breach of contract.","The plaintiff Seeds sought damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. The plaintiff entered into a verbal contract with the defendant that required the defendant to pay 10 per pound on the first day of harvest. The defendant argued that the contract was not valid and that he had not received a fully executed copy of the contract. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $50,000.00 in damages. 1)The defendant did not execute the contract on time. He did not receive a copy of it. The post office was legitimate agent of Johnson Seeds and its employees were sometimes required to take delivery of the seed. 2)The plaintiff received a copy from the Defendant in two telephone conversations. The Defendant confirmed that the contracted was valid. 3)The contract was legally enforceable. The delivery of a fully-executed contract was necessary to complete the contract so that the terms of the deal could be legally binding and enforceable, and the defendant was found to have signed the contract in person, by telephone, and by fax."
b_1999canlii13927.txt,"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the Court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial in the trial proper and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The Court held that it was in the interest of conducting an orderly trial that it would be appropriate to have the accused lead the evidence on voir d dire, which is where the defence gave notice of the Charter applications.  1)It was in this context that the Court reviewed the authorities which were filed by the Crown. 2)It would be unfair to the accused if he were required to lead the trial evidence on an application to exclude evidence. There would be no less severe order than the one proposed in R. v. Kutynec. 3)The accused was to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy and must assert that entitlement at the earliest possible point of the trial. Otherwise, the Crown and the court are entitled to proceed on the basis that no Charter issue is involved. 4)The Court could not see any justification for the procedure presently proposed."
b_2002nspc32.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit and impaired driving. After being involved in an accident, the accused was taken to hospital where a blood demand was given and eventually acceded to. The accused challenged the validity of the blood demand and argued that his right to counsel was violated. Accused guilty of operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit; there was no violation of the accused's right to counsel. The officer had valid grounds to make the demand, having been advised that the accused was in an accident, that someone had said the accused was either high or intoxicated, having smelled a mild odour of alcohol on the accused and the accused having advised him that he only had three beer. Even if the accused's claim to amnesia for all the events around that time was believed, there was no medical evidence to suggest that he could not understand what the officer said to him at the hospital. Although his degree of alertness may have fluctuated, he displayed an understanding of the situation by showing appropriate concern for how much he had been drinking and asking questions which showed an understanding of his situation and what speaking to counsel would entail.","The defendant was charged under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code with operating a motor vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit. The Court found that the defendant had sufficient understanding of the issues at hand as evidenced by his appearance at the scene of the accident, his mental state, his ability to comprehend the situation, and his driving just prior to the accident. HELD: The accused was granted s. 10(b)(c) rights at the time of his arrest under s9, 254(3) and s. 5 of the Code. The accused displayed an understanding of his situation through words and actions spanning a significant period of time. The officer focused on the accused's level of intoxication, not on what the accused had been drinking, and the incriminating nature of the evidence that would be revealed from the blood sample."
b_2002skpc50.txt,"An application for a DNA warrant on the basis s.487.05 (the general warrant provision) of the Criminal Code with respect to DNA warrants does not refer to a form. The applicant suggested a tape recording would avoid the potential problems in bringing the application before a Provincial Court Judge. HELD: These concerns were raised in the January 21 decision concerning potential prejudicial or negative effects, which outweigh any requirement to swear the Information before a judge. An oath taken before a commissioner or notary is as valid as it is before a provincial court judge and avoids all the possible problems that relate to personal attendance. The intention is to make protocol work as flexible as possible, not impeding the police in their legitimate role, while making sure the court maintains its independence. Form 5.01 is specifically set out in the Code. Section 487.1 does not have a form, but even if it did and used the same words 'taken before me', that would elevate form over substance in a significant way.","The accused was charged with submitting an Informational Report, breach of an oath, failure to observe the procedure for obtaining the Report, and breach of a previous court order. He applied to have the accused swear the Information to Obtain the Search Warrant. Application dismissed; officer allowed to swear Information toobtain the warrant; application dismissed. The officer was allowed to use the Information on the basis that the Information as sworn before him is a form and not a form. The Informational Register is a standard form and the form is incorporated into the section itself. The reason for this is that s.487.05 of the Code with respect to DNA warrants has reference to a form which is related to that subject. The form indicates the judge who may in Form 5.01 may in form 5.02. The first line says, 'A Provincial Court Judge who may In Form 5.(1)). The form is right incorporated into a section itself and the judge can then speak to it as he or she chooses. The last line says'sworn before me' which would clearly make it an Information on an oath. The judge can also refer to it in his or her own opinion as to the speed at which it should be sworn."
b_2006nssc221.txt,"Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement. Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The applicant applied to vary spousal support provisions of the Corollary Relief Judgment. The parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation and had received a Corollari Relief Judgment in January 2003. The Corollaries Relief Judgment incorporated the terms of the parties' settlement of the property division issue and incorporated the agreement with respect to spousals. The applicant had received professional advice and assistance from a number of experienced lawyers and was seeking the assistance of a large sum of money to pay her legal fees and the costs of the divorce in addition to the interest on the mortgage. She claimed that the money she received from the landlord was part of her rental income. Application allowed; the respondent's obligation to provide $175,000 to the applicant was reduced to $5,500 per year inclusive of the support payments; the rental income more than covered the mortgage payment.

b_2007nsca75.txt,"A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway. When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed. Appeal dismissed. At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit. It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit. Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.","The defendant was charged with the death of his sister and three others when his car veered off the road and struck a power pole. The plaintiffs sued the defendant, claiming negligence in failing to keep his dog off the highway. The defendant cross-claimed against each other. Application for summary judgment dismissed; the chambers judge found that the applicant had met the burden placed upon him in applying the test for summary judgement. The test was whether the applicant could establish that there was a genuine issue of fact requiring trial, and whether the chambers court erred in dismissing the application for summary justice. The issues on appeal were whether the Chambers judge erred by admitting and relying on the affidavit of the defendant and whether he accepted the exhibits attached to the affidavit. HELD: The application for dismissal was dismissed with costs. 1) The chambers judge did not err in describing the issue of facts as the second question. He simply stated that there had to be a genuine issues of fact to be determined at trial. The issue of credibility was not the focus of the application. The chambers court judge reviewed the various affidavits filed and determined that there were at least three issues which should be considered in the application to determine the application whether the application should be dismissed. 2) The affidavit was severely deficient and did not comply with the law in Nova Scotia respecting the form and contents of affidavits. The affidavits were not considered part of the test. The Chambers judge did refer to factual issues and credibility. 3) The affidavitor evidence was not considered. The evidence of the parties' lawyer was not used. 4) The Court was bound by the decision of the Chamber of Commerce in dismissing this application."
b_2010nssc125.txt,"The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","The plaintiff was charged with dangerous driving causing death following a serious motor vehicle accident. Following the laying of criminal charges, the plaintiff's employer suspended him from work without pay. They offered, however at their expense, the use of their legal counsel to defend him in relation to the criminal charges. The plaintiff filed an expert's report alleging that the trial judge erred in admitting into evidence the video re-enactment of the accident that had been prepared by the police and in allowing into evidence, the opinion of an RCMP traffic analyst when there was an insufficient factual basis established for his opinion. The expert's evidence was not admissible and, in light of the fact that the video was taped at the defendant's expense and the fact the still photographs were not being admitted into evidence at the appeal, the court found that the opinions expressed in the report were not adduced."

As a result, a situation existed where the class action process could continue on only part of the claim until the appeal of consumer protection act issues was heard.

The conference call was convened in September 2010 at which point the parties were given the opportunity to discuss whether it was appropriate to move the matter forward.

b_2011skpc30.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care and control of a motor vehicle and care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.","A warrant was issued for the search of a motor vehicle after a motorist was killed in an accident. The warrant specified that the blood samples were authorized to be taken between the hours of 1:22 o’clock a.m. and 5:22 a. m. The accused’s blood alcohol concentration at the time of the accident was.08. At trial, the accused testified that he believed the registered owner of the vehicle was the driver of the car. He also testified that his blood alcohol content at the scene of the collision was.25. At the conclusion of the trial, Crown and defence agreed that the accused should testify on voir dire for the purpose of the Court making its determination of the validity of the warrant and the admissibility of the Certificate of Analyst. At that point, the Court concluded that the information that the officer had provided to the Justice in support of the search warrant was not sufficient to sustain the accused”s s. 8 rights. The Court held that the warrant to search for blood was invalid. The officer had failed to communicate the basic information required of him by law. The Certificate of Analysis was not included in the Information to Obtain and the report from the analyst was not a valid source of the information. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner was satisfied that the Certificate was not the only source of information required in order to determine whether the warrant should be issued. The Crown and the accused were jointly responsible for the loss of valuable bodily tissue and the loss in value of valuable blood. The court found that the Crown and accused had both failed to demonstrate a reasonable likelihood of the officer having reasonable grounds to believe that the driver, who had been driving the vehicle that day, was the person to whom the blood was drawn, having committed an offence under s. 253. The Justice in the circumstances was satisfied with the officer’ s. 2 certificate of analyst and the date of the voir de dire. The evidence heard on the voier dire was that the person who had provided the information to the officer was unconscious and had been drinking alcohol. Therefore, the warrant was invalid and the information which the officer deposed in the information was not supported by the material contained therein. The reviewing judge concluded that it did not constitute reasonable grounds for the belief that the individual who had testified pursuant to the R. v. Garafoli decision was not in breach of the accused s.8 rights. Therefore the Court held the officer should have given more detail in the report and the Certificate"
b_2016skqb297.txt,"HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made. The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.",HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the allegations were not statements of fact. The respondent’s evidence of addictions to pornography and masturbation did not support the petitioner’ s allegations of sexual abuse. The Court found that the respondent”s anger management problems made it impossible for him to access the family home and that his children were afraid of him. The petitioner” s reasons for applying were that the parties were in conflict and the respondent had anger management issues. The evidence did not show any of this. The fact that the petitioner alleged the respondent pinched her bum to have her move over does not mean that the child was not significantly or equally engaged in the care of their children. The only conclusion drawn from the incident was that the evidence suggested that the father was significantly involved in his daughters’ lives. The issue was whether the respondent should be restricted to supervised access.
c_1993canlii3443.txt,"This was an appeal of a decision which denied variation of a maintenance award where a lump sum had been previously ordered. The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application. Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court, that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation. The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances. Accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to vary awards of lump sum child support made pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Family Court, pursuant to s. 44 of the FAM Act. The order in question was a unique creation of the old Children of Unmarried Parents Act and was governed by the principles of that Act, which were outside the legislative scheme of the FSA. The father had made no further payment since that time and had not had contact with the child. In 1993 the appellant made an application for variation of this order pursuant to the Children ofUnmarried Parents Acts. The applicant sought to have the order varied, rescinded or suspended, and a judge may vary, rescind or suspend the order on the basis that the circumstances have changed. The respondent elected to make the lump sum payment in 1985 and did so on or about the 2nd of October 1985. The Respondent made no more payment since then and had no contact with his child. The matter was adjourned with the direction that the judge return the decision of this appeal and the application for a variation be heard. The court referred to Freeman, J.A. and Freeman in their decision respecting the lump sums paid under the Children's Unmarried parents Act. In this appeal the court referred only to the finality of the lump-sum payment under the Family Maintenance Act and the principle of clean break which enables the parties to meet their obligations is not an unjust one even by today's standards. The general principles favouring the claimant must yield to the clear, specific intention of the statute and the order made under it. The case Gillis v. Soulis was not determinative of the issue before the court but it was in error in concluding that it was determinative. Section 37 of the FA Act provides for an order for payment of maintenance expenses in the amount of $209, periodic payments for the support of the child in the amounts of $100 and $200, and the alternative lump sum payments of $7,500 be paid by the 14th day of October 1986 together with lying in expenses of $208. The judge made no determination as to whether the lump amount could be varied. In his decision he held that the finale of the order under the FMA was removed by s.34, which states with finality that 'this Part', the part dealing with the father's civil liability to pay maintenance, to which the Family maintenance Act is successor legislation, 'this part shall not apply to any punitive father who has fulfilled the terms of any order made against him with respect to the same child under Part 1'.""

A custody investigation conducted in 1990 when the mother had first commenced this application had recommended that the existing arrangement be continued. The Father now intended, however, to move with the children to Ontario to take additional education. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Judge found that the move to Ontario was a sufficient change of circumstances to permit a variation application to proceed. She therefore proceeded to consider if the move was in the best interests of the children. 2)The Judge reviewed recent authorities from across Canada dealing with whether a custodial parent should be permitted to move with the children. 3)In the circumstances of this case the Judge was convinced that the move was reasonable and was not motivated by any desire on the part of the Father to thwart the Mother's access.","An application for variation of the January 1990 judgment, which gave judgment for divorce and joint custody to the parents of two boys born April 22, 1984 and June 3, 1986. The mother had moved from Ontario to British Columbia, and had previously been granted interim custody. The father applied to vary the judgment in 1990 claiming joint custody with principal residence with the mother. The Mother had previously applied to the Court of Appeal for variation in 1990. The Court of Queen's Bench dismissed the application and ordered that the matter return to the Supreme Court of British Columbia on the basis that the mother's application was not brought as an application for a decree of nullity or divorce and custody but as an attempt to have the custody of the children moved out of Saskatchewan to a new community. The petitioner mother had always been the primary care giver of the boys and had generous access. The applicant mother wished to move to Ontario and had been denied access for several years. The respondent had made arrangements to have his entire family move there, except for the mother, who was unable to work outside the home. The appellant argued that this would be a material and significant change in the circumstances of the young children and that moving would be in the best interests of the entire family. The court dismissed the respondent's application for joint custody. It held that an incident of custody included the determination by the custodial parent of where the parent and child shall live and provisions for possible access in Hawaii. On appeal the Court upheld the order. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The Court of Canada had a stated purpose in making this application. 2)The petitioner mother must demonstrate that her wish to move from Saskatchewan to Ontario is seriously motivated by a wish to thwart the father's access.

The last three income tax returns of the father indicated an average gross income of $28,000 after adjustments.

The father sought to reduce the support contained in the 1997 divorce judgment which incorporated the parties' interspousal agreements regarding custody, access and child and spousal support. The parties were married in 1985 and separated in 1995. The mother was on leave from her employment. When his federal government management position was declared redundant, the applicant received a retiring allowance of $75,646 in May 1997. The respondent opposed the application on the basis there had been no change in circumstances since the judgment was granted; she had no other income than the support payments and child tax credit; alternatively, there were special provisions in the parties' separation agreement which would permit the court to award an amount that differs from the amount prescribed by the Guidelines.HELD: 1)The judgment the applicant sought to vary was made after the coming into force of the Guidelines. It did not however include a determination of child support made in accordance with the Guidelines. There was no change in the childrens' or mother's circumstances. The applicant was unemployed but was still benefiting from his retiring allowance at the time of the order which he no longer enjoyed. A variation was warranted as there had been a change in the father's financial means and circumstances. The Guideline support obligation for two children is $341 per month.  2)It could not be concluded on the evidence presented that there was any special provision in the parties' agreement that directly or indirectly benefited either child. The provision for child support in a specified amount greater than that provided in the Guidelines was not a 'special provision' as contemplated by s17(6.2) of the Divorce Act given the change in circumstances of the applicant whose annual income had dropped from $55,500 to $24,000 a year.  3)No order was made as to costs.","FIAT.

The mother was on leave from her employment and the parties had entered into an interspousal agreement. The husband was unemployed and had stopped receiving child support in 1997.

It did not include a determination of child support made in accordance with table. 2)There was no change in the circumstances of the wife. She was only ordered to pay $975 per month for the two children of the marriage, who were to be the primary beneficiaries of the spousal support. She did not assume any responsibility for the mortgage and the child and spousals support. 3)The applicant had assumed all responsibility for all child support payable by her. She had assumed that the terms of the agreement, including the mortgage, provided that she repay any outstanding spousousal debt of $20,000 which she had incurred in the past four years. 4)The application for a variation of child and child support obligation was discontinued."
c_1999skqb178.txt,"Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute. The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in the proceeding, there were also questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial. HELD: The tapes were admitted to their entirety and were allowed to go in unedited. 1) Although custody was of central importance to the case, there are also questions regarding child support, division of the property and the abuse that was occurring in the mother's home. The tapes have the opposite effect. They speak volumes about the father's character and motivations while shedding little light on the mother. The tape recordings are inadmissible unless their authenticity is established, they are shown to be true and unaltered record and the voices have been properly identified. 2) Although the father was not seeking to have the tapes admitted, he was frustrated and frustrated by the mother’s failure to make an effort to obtain financing to buy out his share of the mortgage, real estate commission and legal fees. The mother was clearly frustrated and unable to get the attention she needed to succeed in her new job. 3) The tapes had the opposite affect. They spoke volumes about both the father’d character and motivation while shedding a little light upon the mother and children."

c_2003skpc17.txt,The accused was charged with failure to provide forthwith a breath sample contrary to Criminal Code s.254(5). HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused. The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand to provide a sample of his breath by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to enable proper analysis of his Breath to be made by means of an approved screening device. The accused argued that he was on patrol in the Paddockwood District on the date in question with 'ride along'. He testified that he noted the vehicle swerved to the right-hand side of the highway more than necessary as he approached it. The 'ride-along' had no duties and was simply with the accused. The officer testified that at 2:00 a.m. he noted that the accused's vehicle swerve to the left-hand shoulder more than he should have. The police vehicle pulled to a complete stop and the accused blew his breath sample. The corporal testified that the officer then stopped the vehicle. The vehicle swerving again and again as the officer approached it more than it should have been. The Corporal testified at trial that he had three beers the whole night. He said he had to stop the second test as he was blowing outside the mouthpiece again. The second test was stopped as the accused continued to blow outside the mask. The constable testified that when the ready light came on the accused’s vehicle swirled to the wrong-hand-hand line. The defence was that the breath sample was necessary to enable the analysis of the breath to be conducted by an approved screen. The failure to provide an adequate sample was due to lack of cander. The RCMP were required to provide adequate instructions to the accused on what to do with the sample and provided adequate instructions on how to provide the sample. HELD: The accused was guilty as charged. 1)The mental element of the offence of refusal created by s.254(5) of The Code consists of intentional non-compliance. The court accepted the accused because the accused was not intentionally trying to avoid providing an adequate Sample. He was attempting to avoid giving an adequate opinion over that of the officer. 2)The officer’ s lack of sensitivity in giving his testimony raised doubts in the mind of the court. The Court was satisfied that the police officer did not understand why the accused had failed to provide proper sample on the night in question. The officers were instructed in the proper manner how to give a proper sample. 3)The court was satisfied on the evidence that the person who provided the breath samples did not provide adequate instruction in how to obtain adequate instructions and instructions
c_2004nsca135.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, with the only live issue at trial being whether the Crown had proved the absence of the complainant's consent beyond a reasonable doubt. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review. The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt. It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence.","A cocaine fuelled encounter between the appellant and the woman with whom he was living resulted in his conviction for assault and sexual assault. He appealed the conviction submitting that it was unreasonable, was based on misapplication of the burden of proof and that the judge's reasons were so deficient as to constitute an error of law. The appeal was dismissed as there was ample evidence which supported the conviction.

c_2005nsca7.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. Both parties appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract. The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation. Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","The plaintiff brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misstatement. The defendant sought to have the contract terminated because the plaintiff failed to provide the approximate tonnages sought. The plaintiff refused to supply and maintain the equipment and the plaintiff was awarded nothing. The action was tried over nearly 30 days before MacAdam in the Supreme Court. The issues were: 1) the breach of the contract was found, the court found, and the breach entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice; 2) the plaintiff cross-appealed. It was found that the plaintiff had not performed the contract and that the defendant could not rely on the exclusion of liability clause relating to its estimates; 3) the trial judge dismissed all of the plaintiff's damages except for the $10,000 awarded for extra work at the 'C' and 'H' tracks. The damages related mainly to the costs incurred by the plaintiff in obtaining substituted performance of thecontract and the refund of overpayments made to the plaintiff for which no work had been performed.

At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment. It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her. In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal. Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.  2) The contract of employment was a term contract extending from May to August 31, 2004. The plaintiff was dismissed on July 12.

The ad in the local newspaper advertised for two positions. The advertised for one position. The actual position was for a different time. The receptionist was hired after the defendant dismissed two employees. The second position was vacant and the plaintiff was given a month's notice. 2)The plaintiff was not aware of the job advertised for and she was asked to train another employee. 3)The defendant dismissed the plaintiff without just a cause. The evidence that she had been negligent in not completing certain tasks was not contradicted. 4)The court found that the relationship of master and servant was implied in the contract of hiring an obligation to give reasonable notice of an intention to terminate. 5)The evidence that the plaintiff had received employment training and that she was only given nominal training in financial matters could not be said that she were not competent. 6)The Court dismissed the employer's claim for damages.

The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions. The plaintiff is a councillor. The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act. There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council. The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions.

While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council. The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the parties is a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. 2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful. This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care. Her actions were not negligent.","The plaintiff sought damages for injuries suffered as a result of her actions as Reeve of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood.

The Court found that the defendant was acting with a personal advantage to the plaintiffs and that her actions were not negligent. The defendant was performing her duties in a manner that permitted her to infer from her legal opinion that she had no legal authority to impose the sanctions on him."
c_2006skqb335.txt,"FIAT: The former vice-president of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan. He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour. He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application. Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart. It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart. The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart. HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed. The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.  1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit. This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility. The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents. 2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents. There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.  3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart. Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations. Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart. However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them. Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias. To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy. That is not good enough.","FIAT: Wal-Mart is the applicant company. The first motion is brought by the union. It seeks an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and Rule 673 prohibiting the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board as presently constituted from hearing and/or making any orders involving Wal-Marts. The second motion is by the United Food and Commercial Workers, Local 1400 which was added as a party with the consent of the applicant. In the first motion the Union seeks an Order striking and removing virtually all the material filed in support of the application by Wal-mart. In both motions the Union applies for an order dismissing Wal- Mart's motion. Wal- mart's application to strike and remove portions of the material and applies for costs of the within application. HELD: 1) The affidavits of the union and Wal-marts are admissible. The transcript of the radio broadcast and the portions of an article which were critical and disparaging of Wal-Wal-Mart are admissible. Wal Wal-WMart's application is dismissed. 2) Wal-Way is a former vice-chairperson of the Saskatchewan LRB. Its term expired in March 2006 and was not renewed. He commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan. The critical allegations originate with him. Absent any explanation for his absence, there is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proferred documents as evidence. 3) Wal Wal Mart's application for an Order prohibiting the SLRB from hearing or making any order involving Wal WalMart Canada Corp. or until further order of this Court is dismissed, as Wal- Way has no established track record of accuracy and reliability. 4) Wal Mart has admitted that it did not adduce or provide the necessary required reading. The affidavit and transcript of 'John Gormley Live' were admissible by reason of s. 664 of the SEDA Act. 5) WalMart is not the only corporation that filed an application to the SRL Board seeking an order striking and remove virtually all material filed by Wal Wal Wal. The statements of claim in Walter Matkowski v. Government of Sask. et al. filed in Saskatoon are adduced by WalWal-WalMart.com. It is Wal-law's position that the actions of the Unions, the interference by the government and the presence of certain publications demonstrate that the Saskatchewan lRB is biased or, at the very least, there was a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal-"
c_2007nsca4.txt,"The appellants applied for leave to amend their notice of appeal in regard to an order requiring them to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications. The application was opposed, inter alia, on the basis that the allegations which underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the trial judge, were irrelevant on the application and were not ruled on by the trial judge. Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make. The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","The appellants sought leave to amend their notice of appeal. Leave was required because the underlying proceeding was an application for leave to appeal and, if granted, an appeal from an order requiring the appellants to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications in which they will be the moving parties. The application was opposed by the respondent 2301072 Nova Scotia Limited and the intervenor 230102 Dominion Bank. As the appellant argued their arguments in opposition to the amendment were for a panel and not a chambers judge, those arguments were for the panel and therefore, not chambers judge to consider. The amendment was reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice in the sense that it is a chambers Judge who is asked to grant leave to amendment a notice of Appeal."

Although both she and her husband had good incomes, it would still take several more years to discharge the loans without prejudicing her family's reasonably frugal lifestyle. Relief granted; to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties. The bankrupt had acted in good faith and had been unable to service the loans in the early years when she did not have permanent employment. Compromising the debt and requiring her to only pay half of it was not an available option.","The Bankrupt, who had outstanding student loans of about $39,000, applied for relief under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. She had applied for interest relief in the amount of $1,000.00. HELD: The Bankrupt was entitled to an order that Paragraph 178 (1)(g) does not apply to her outstanding student loan. The Court reviewed the circumstances and found that the applicant had acted with good faith. The Bankrupted acted with respect to the principles underlying the Bankutions Act. The court found that although the applicant acted with faith, it would take several years to discharge the loans, which would be a continuation of financial difficulty that prevented her from paying the loans. The debts date back 13 years. She made her proposal in 2000, and completed it in 2005 and was no further ahead. Another five years have passed. To expect them to pay in a shorter period would be too long. It would also protract the burden of the loans in a manner inconsistent with the overall objectives of the BIA."
c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accused’s stepmother had called the accused prior to the search of their home and the accused”s father had also been charged with possession of firearms. The accused“s” in the statement provided by the accused was not the father. The statement by the Crown that the accused had constructive and/or joint possession of the firearms was not supported by the evidence presented by the defence. The evidence presented through the defence was that the father”d had constructive possession of all of the guns at the home,”[1] and that the intercepts were of significant importance to the firearms trafficking charges. The Crown” s”evidence” asserted that the guilty pleas of the accused did not associate him with the phone and therefore the accused could not at trial demand that the Crown prove the phone is his. HELD: 1)The accused was found guilty on all charges.  2)The evidence presented was that a sawed-off shotgun and ammunition were found in the father and the stepmother” and that a gun and ammunition was found in their respective possession. 3)The Crown had not resorted to the accused having constructive and or joint possession or constructive possession by the appellant in relation to the guns. The key evidence on the firearms possession charges were the intercept reports. 4)The defence did not concede continuity. The burden of proof rests on the prosecution throughout the case and never shifts to the the accused. An assessment that an accused is probably guilty is insufficient. Reasonable doubt is the whole of the evidence that must be assessed in the determination of whether the Crown has made out its case. The court was unable to accept that the appellant can assert a privacy interest in order to obtain the protection of s8 of the Charter and then claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. 5)The fact that the evidence was presented by defence witnesses and the evidence not supported the Crown’S position that the applicant” had constructive, or joint, possession of” the firearms” was not a factor in the possession of them. 6)The applicant did not have a Firearms Acquisition Certificate or any other kind of license for possessing firearms nor did he have valid registration certificate for any of the 80 Cavendish firearms."

The defendant appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench arguing that the appeal decision was unreasonable and unfounded by theevidence and that trial judge improperly interfered. HELD: Leave to appeal was denied. 1)Leave to appeal should not be granted to the defendant company. The trial judge did not commit any error in weighing the central issue of fact with respect to the central issues but he did commit an error in considering the central question of fact. 2)The essential facts were relatively straightforward. The contract was signed in May 2014 and the defendant telephoned the plaintiff to ask if he was prepared to do only portion of the seeding and to'seed along side us'. The trial decision was made in June 2016 and the trial decision is still unresolved. 3)Leave was granted to appeal on the central questions of fact, which were not characterized by any possible error in the trial process. The issues raised by the defendant were minor and were not relevant to the outcome of the case. 4)Leave should not have been granted to any company. It was unnecessary and in the interest of expediency the court had to decide between costs of the appeal and costs of expediting the decision."

d_1990canlii4118.txt,"In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice. The plaintiff had correctly interpreted the clause as relating to the termination of the agreement, not of his employment. The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta. The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months. He was also awarded the loss resulting from the difference in vacation and loss of an auto allowance for the 15 months. For emotional trauma, which lasted only briefly, he received $500.","This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff was assigned to work for the defendant company as an expatriate. He received a salary of $60,000. In return, the defendant offered him a position in the private sector. The employee at the time thought he could leave the company on three months notice but was offered nothing in lieu of notice. The defendant refused, claiming the clause in the agreement which required the employee to give 30 days notice was not relevant. The action was allowed in part because the defendant had not explicitly stated that the clause required the employer to give the plaintiff 30 days' notice. As the plaintiff was a high level employee and had experience in several positions, he assumed the position of project manager for the company would be more suitable. He assumed the job would be for a lower level position and the employee would receive compensation for his time in the position. The documents filed at the trial all stated that reasonable notice of termination was required initially when there was no written contract, then when the contract was extended to include additional positions. The claim that the 30 days served as notice was dismissed without cause. The court found that reasonable notices must not be given in the nature of contractually binding agreements."

d_1995canlii4259.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the trial judge arising out of an interpleader application by the respondent Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owing by the Band under a construction contract entered into by the Respondent with the respondent Francis for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. The Respondent had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specified to the various claimants. The respondent had made several assignments to entities other than the Indian Band under the construction contract. The trial judge held that s. 89(1) of the Indian Act should not be confused with s. 87 of the Act. In interpreting s.87 of the act, the learned judge misinterpreted s.89(1), which states that an agreement which is not evidenced by writing and filed in compliance with section is void even against a party having notice. S. 52(1)(i) of The Accused obtained his or her funds by way of a letter to his solicitor instructing him to pay to the respondent's funds which were due to him from the respondent in the form of a bank draft payable to the Band in trust. Sahl, J.A. asserted the respondent misinterpreted the Act and that the Fund was entitled up to $70,000. It would appear that s.(1) is not intended to remedy the economically disadvantaged position of Indians by ensuring that an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is void. When an Indian is in business he or she holds and deals with his or his business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all other Canadians. The protection afforded by s.(89(2) of s.88(1)) of the acts was limited to the protection afforded to book debts in the ambit of the Acts."

d_2002skqb80.txt,"The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion.","The applicant Credit Union loaned the respondent $37,700 upon a security of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer. The respondent's wife had apparently been the person who used the vehicle under the registration certificate and who had made payments on it under the original purchase agreement. Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made the respondent aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period September 11, 2001, to November 14, 2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The wife sought to defeat the security on the ground that she was at all times the real owner of the vehicle, had made the payments and was always in possession of the car. HELD: The claim of the Credit union was enforceable as against the conflicting claim of Ms. Clayton. 1)The evidence of ownership is important but not the principal determinant of ownership. The Bank of Montreal case was one of several that dealt with the use of a title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by SGI. 2)The claim of a Credit Union was enforceABLE. The claim was not enforceable in the special circumstances of this matter.  3)The applicant had transferred ownership from her husband's estate to her name and such a transfer would only serve the purpose of defeating the Creditunion's claim if undertaken for value and without notice, which was not the case here."

At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol content greater than.08. The defence brought a motion to exclude the Certificate of Analysis on the basis that it was based on an approved screening device demand and the accused had consumed alcohol in such a quantity that her blood alcohol concentration exceeded.08 and she was unable to produce a driver's licence or registration. At trial, the Crown conceded that if such a Charter breach were found, the appropriate remedy would be to exclude them both. At issue was whether the arresting officer formed the requisite belief necessary to make roadside demand pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code and whether the officer's opinion, so formed, could be objectively upheld on the evidence leading to such a demand. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1) The words 'had consumed alcohol' were insufficient insufficient to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in his body at the time of the ASD demand. 2) The officer's subjective belief in the subjective subjective subjective belief that he had a reasonably reasonable suspicion was not raised on the grounds raised by the defence. The officer was aware that the accused's last drink was less than an hour prior to being stopped. The objective of the officer having a reasonable doubt as to the consumption of alcohol by the accused could not be raised on a case by case basis. The subjective subjective impression that consumption of Alcohol at some point in itself equates to having alcohol in the body was not supported by the evidence. 3) The Certificate ofalyses were not included in the defence's application to exclude it as a result of an invalid approved screening devices demand. The Court was persuaded that the words 'Had consumed alcohol'"" were indeed insufficient for the court to conclude the officer has a reasonable belief there was alcohol in her body at that time of that ASD demand which infringed the accused s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights."

He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","The appellant father was ordered to pay maintenance for his son pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act. The mother had a previous relationship with the father prior to the accident. The father had been paying child support since the accident, but had abandoned his plans to pursue post-secondary studies and had taken a leave from his job. He had returned to live with his mother after completing grade 12 in Millwood High School. He then suffered a severe brain injury in a motor vehicle accident. He was hospitalized for four months and then re-enrolled in Grade 12 in order to improve his marks. The parties' relationship was short and the child had not made firm plans on a course of study. He now sought employment, but was unable to work or further his education. The maintenance application was dismissed with costs payable by the father to the mother in the amount of $2,000. The court was not persuaded that the judge erred in concluding the child did not withdraw and was unable, at that time, to withdraw from his parent's charge."
d_2005nsca71.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. The court disbelieved his evidence, principally because it was found to be internally inconsistent. The court found that the appellant had attempted to portray himself as being good to the children but had admitted on cross-examination that the children had been removed from the home due to allegations of physical abuse and lack of food. There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","The appellant appealed his conviction by the trial judge of a charge of sexual assault on the grounds that she misapprehended his evidence. The appellant testified at trial that he had been good to the children and that he asked them not to be left alone with them because he was afraid of being charged with sexual assault. On appeal, the appellant argued that his conviction was a miscarriage of justice because the trial court based her rejection of his testimony on material misapprehensions of the evidence. He argued that the judge's reasons for rejecting the appellant's evidence were based on misappreciation of the children's evidence and that the inference drawn from this evidence could not have been more unjustified. He also argued that there was no evidence of physical abuse or neglect on the record and that his children had been removed from the home because of allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Allowing the appeal, that the trial Judge's reasons were based upon misapportunes and not on proper analysis of evidence.  1) The trial judge's misappapprehension of the case was substantial. She ascribed to the evidence about the involvement of Children's Services, relevance that it simply could not, and the inference drew from this information could not be more unjustifiable. 2) The conviction constitutes a miscarriageof justice and must be set aside. The misapparation of evidence may consist of a failure to consider evidence relevant to a material issue, mistake as to the substance of theevidence, or failure to give proper effect to evidence. 3) The judge's reasoning on this point was inconsistent and was not supported by law or logic on this record."
d_2005nssc322.txt,"The plaintiff, who was injured in a rear-end motor vehicle accident, applied for summary judgment and an interim payment of damages. Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.","The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence that there were no brake lights on the plaintiff’s vehicle, the only arguable issues to be considered was whether the brake lights were working and whether the plaintiff had bonafide defence or issue to try. The plaintiff also argued that she had been struck from behind by one of the defendants in the motor vehicle incident. Application allowed; costs of this appeal and application before the court in the cause of the action were directed to be paid in the amount of $2,500,000. The application was allowed on the basis that there had not been an independent medical exam conducted. The plaintiffs affidavit evidence had been examined but there was no 'air of reality' to it. The defendants argued that since they had not obtained an independent opinion in the discovery of their evidence, it was appropriate to order an interim judgment. They also argued there was a significant amount of other factors relating to the plaintiff including depression, anxiety, anxiety and other symptoms of the motor car accident resulting in her suffering injuries. Application for summary judgement dismissed on the ground that there would be an 'air' of reality to the defence and there was not. The affidavit evidence showed that the plaintiff was struck from the behind by the defendant’ s vehicle from behind. There was no “air of realism” to the defendant argument as to her prior conditions which led to her current health problems. The affidavits showed that although the defendant had not shown any symptoms of depression or anxiety related to her injuries, there were other factors which would contribute in significant way to her health problems: an injury to her elbow prior to the motorcyle accident, shoulder injuries, tingling in her hands and arms and other injuries on the accident, depression and anxiety and the defendant was travelling too close or didn’t have enough care or control of his vehicle and consequently the collision occurred."
d_2006nsca124.txt,"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent, who challenged the validity of a search warrant issued by the judge who excluded evidence obtained in the search of her home. The Crown alleged the judge erred in law by failing to apply the standard of review set out in R. v. Garofoli (1998). Appeal allowed; a new trial ordered. The court found that the judge's standard of analysis was incorrect and that, in this case, the judge misapplied the standard upon which he was to review the decision. The trial judge's approach to this issue reveals an extricable legal error which must be addressed. The fact that the respondent's evidence was not corroborated by the evidence gathered by the police was not enough to establish a reasonable and probable ground for the warrant. The evidence obtained as a result of the search was wrongly excluded and, in the result, the result would not necessarily have been the same."

There is no reference to Richie whose name appears on the tenancy agreement. 2) Even though the decision states that the Notice of Hearing was properly served, that cannot be the end of the matter given that there is nothing in the file which would indicate any directions having been given to the landlord with respect to service other than personal service. Ivy and Richie did not appear at the hearing and the decision does not even identify Richie as being one of the tenants. More is required to ensure service of and notice to all the tenants. 3) There are no notes nor is there anything in the decision which would permit the Court to conclude that the issue of service on Ivy and Richie was ever considered by the Rentalsman.

However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400.","FIAT: The Court ordered a number of orders regarding child support and an order regarding summer access. The remaining issues were: what, if any, should the father pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children; what, pursuant to s. 7(1)(d) of the Divorce Act, the father's entitlement to interim spousal support was denied; and what, in the interim, should be retroactive child support. HELD: 1)The father was to pay $8,650 per month pursuant to the Order for Children and Family Services. 2)The mother's claim for interim spOUSAL support was made pursuant to S. 15.3(1) of The DivorceAct, as am directed by s. 15(1), of the Act to give priority to child support in determining child and spousary support applications. In the matter before me, the Court ordered that the Sylvan Learning Centre expenses be paid to the father in addition to his s. child support payment, with his proportionate share of the Sylvanian fees being an amount equal to 71% of the total cost. The childcare costs were necessary and reasonable. The Learning Centre costs were also necessary and reasonably reasonable. 2.The father's contribution of $843 per month was sufficient to determine the approximate net monthly income of four children. 3.The mother was ordered to contribute his net monthly cash flow in the sum of $2,700. 4.The cost of the childcare was included in the cost of living for the four children and the father was ordered his proportionated share of all costs. 5.The Sylvan learning centre expenses were also included in his child support payments. The father was given his proportionates share of costs after tax. The mother was to contribute her net monthly sum of$1,050. The Court was satisfied that the cost was reasonable and that the costs of providing the children with the means to pay for the services they needed were within the father’s means. 6.The costs of the child care expenses were included in s. 8 of the Order. The cost of providing child support for the mother was $1,843. The child support application for the time period from February 2006 to February 2007 was adjourned s. 5(1).

d_2009nssm48.txt,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","The landlord appealed an order of the Director of Residential Tenancies which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy, but also denied the landlord's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the tenant effectively refused to renew for another year. The tenants had been operating in a state of uncertainty, not knowing the status of the tenancy, and had been given the option to sublet at any time during the year. They appealed the decision of the director which effectively allowed the tenant's request to convert the lease into month to year tenancy, only to have the decision be reversed within 30 days. The landlord argued that the decision to not to renew the lease was arbitrary and unreasonable. Allowing the appeal, that the lease has not been converted into a monthly tenancy because the landlord refused to consent in a timely manner and because the tenants had not been able to negotiate with the landlord in such a fashion as to when the change in term of the lease would occur. In the unique circumstances of this case, it was appropriate that the tenant and not the landlord incur that risk."

The evidence of witnesses who testified did not support the accused's conviction. However, there was nothing from any of the witnesses who spoke which undermined credibility. The complainant's father advised that he had heard a thump from the bedroom when the infant fell or slipped from the accused’s grasp. The accused had been seen entering the bedroom through the closed door. The mother was not able to see what had happened. The argument escalated and the accused assaulted the complainant with one hand. The assault was heard over and over again. Hearsay: The evidence is not credible. The Crown must prove that its evidence is credible. Even if the Court prefers the evidence the Crown, it must still consider whether the case for the defence raises a reasonable question. The credibility of material witnesses needs to be considered in that context. The determination of credibility does not involve the Court opting for one version of events or the other. Rather, the Crown must demonstrate that its case is credible, and there is no onus on the accused whatsoever in that respect. The issues are whether the Crown is sufficiently credible and credible to establish non-Consent beyond A reasonable doubt and whether, on the evidence, the accused was able to prove the non-convenience of non-participation by the Crown with reasonable doubt, which the Crown did not do."

The dissenting judge claimed that this was a case of first impression and that the court misinterpreted its definition of Custody. The appellant appealed. In his appeal, Crown counsel argued that there were no other cases available to the Court as a result of the 677 decision. They argued that they had not reviewed the decision in a previous trial and that they should have re-expedited their decision by exercising their discretion in this case. Allowing the appeal and ordering a review, that the decision was not made in a new fashion and that there are no other case law available that would justify"
e_2000canlii4625.txt,"The accused was charged with four offences relating to a twelve year old girl, including sexual assault and uttering a threat. He was released on bail with a surety. The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence.","The Crown applied for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into the the accused in respect to a twelve year old girl. The accused was charged with four criminal matters, of sexual assault under s. 271(1)(a), uttering a threat, sexual touching under s.(1)(b) and unlawfully having a weapon. The surety had signed the recognizant prior to signing it and testified that after he was advised that he should not have signed the document, he was told to return to Nova Scotia. The judge granted the application and set aside the forfeiture order. The court found that the accused had no concept of his obligations under the recognition and that he mistakenly believed that his responsibilities or liability ended with the accused's first appearance in Court following his release. It would not be just and appropriate to order forfeiture on the part of the accused."
e_2000skqb515.txt,"The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln. Fair was convicted of trafficking in marihuana and possession for the purpose of trafficking. Brooks applied pursuant pursuant to S. 20(4) for an Order declaring her interest in the Lincoln is not affected by any forfeiture order. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)The automobile was owned by Brooks. It was not her residence. 2)The Lincoln was not used for the purposes of transporting drugs. It had been rented to the applicant. 3)The affidavit deposed that she loaded our luggage in to the Lincoln and then loaded it in to it. 4)She did not have any knowledge of the contents of the bag or of the drugs in the trunk. 5)The evidence in the trial did not rebut the Crown's assertion that the Lincoln was used for a designated substance offence. The affidavit depated that she had seen something on the floor of the vehicle but was not aware of its contents. 6)The court must first consider the gravity of the offence, the personal characteristics of the offender and the extent of their knowledge of what it might be like to transport controlled drugs and substances.

The School Board breached its general duty to act fairly in allowing a Board member to vote when he had not attended the public meetings on the issue. The Board did not meet the onus on it to show that the member had appropriate firsthand knowledge of the evidence and submission of the applicants.","This was an application advanced by seven applicants for an order pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 56 in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Board to close the two schools. All seven applicants are parents of children attending the two school systems. The applicants have children attending these schools.

e_2001skqb466.txt,"The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","The plaintiff sought damages for injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The plaintiff had been in the produce department of the store at around 3:45 pm. She had been to the store's maintenance department at 4:52 pm. The maintenance department was dry and wet. At 5:45 am. the plaintiff was taken to the Pasqua Hospital Emergency Department where she was bandaged, given painkillers and advised to rest and see her family doctor if her injuries did not improve. At 6:45am. the defendant was performing maintenance at the store and a sweep log showed that floors in the store were swept at least once per hour. At 7:00 pm on a typical day the plaintiff fell from the ceiling of the produce store and was taken off the floor by an ambulance. At 8:00 am on a regular program of maintenance was conducted by the defendant in the area of the floor and at 2:52 am on the same day. At 3:55 pm the floors were swept by a dry and damp mop. At 4:55 am the floors in produce were cleaned by a second employee of the defendant who was cross-examined by the plaintiff at trial. At 12:50 pm on the day of the accident the floor was wet and dry mopped by another employee of The Real Canadian Superstore who testified that he had earlier left his employment with the defendant and did not know his whereabouts. At 2:40 pm the floor of the Produce Department was wet, dry mopping by another individual who had left his job with the Defendant and was working in the same store. At 1:43 pm the defendant employees were all working in different floors and the plaintiff had to cross-examination by the Court to confirm whether or not she had slipped. At that point the plaintiff's affidavit was not filed and no further affidavits were filed. The defendant did not file a separate affidavit sworn by the employee but it was clear that it was the same individual who testified at the time of the incident. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water or produce on the floor in a grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. The defendants did not knowingly or negligently report any of the activities undertaken in the stores prior to the incident or during the sweep log entries. 2)There were no injuries to the plaintiff.

The evidence of impairment was too weak to convict the appellant. The officer told the accused that if he passed the ALERT test, he would be sent on his way. Thus, she must not have thought that the appellant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired. Failure to act cannot be considered by the trial judge as part of the reasonable and probable grounds.","The appellant was charged with impaired driving contrary to the facts and contravening s.686(1)(b)(ii) and s.685(2) by failing to take a breathalyzer test. The Provincial Court judge dismissed the refusal count as the officer had failed in his testimony to give evidence of the words used in the 'alert' demand. That decision was not under appeal. The appeal was allowed and the conviction quashed. HELD: The appeal is allowed and conviction quashing. 1) The findings of the trial judge do not address fully the various indicia of impaired driving beyond the findings that the accused had been drinking, had a very slight accident and failed the SL-2. It was, however, open to him as well on the evidence before him to consider that the appellant (a) had bloodshot eyes and (b) had a moderate smell of alcohol on him. 2) The learned trial judge did not address the defence evidence adduced that the appeal was justified on the ground that the deprivation is minimal when the invariable result would be another conviction. 3) The evidence was weak to the point where there was virtually no choice but to acquit."
e_2003skqb286.txt,"FIAT. At issue was whether there a change of circumstances, which would warrant a variation of the 2002 child support order; whether the 18 year old continued to be a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act; does the father have an obligation to contribute to his daughter's riding lessons; the father's income for child support purposes; should the 17 year old son's s.7 expenses be increased; costs. HELD: 1)The daughter had ceased to be a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and the father's obligation to provide on-going support and his contribution for s.7 expenses relating to her riding lesson terminated in March 2003. 2)The father shall pay $308 per month for support of his son commencing April 1, 2003 and every month thereafter so long as he remains a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 3)The mother's application to increase the father's contribution for the son's extracurricular activities was dismissed. The father shall pay $54 per month for hockey expenses commencing June 2003 and every month thereafter. 4)The mother was to forthwith pay costs of the application fixed at $250.","FIAT. The husband sought to vary the May 2002 support order on the basis of his income had decreased as a result of being laid off from his employment and that the parties' oldest child, Jasmine, was no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. The wife opposed the application on the grounds that the layoff was only temporary and Jasmine continued to be a child of the marriage and that her s. 7 expenses were not incurred for more than a year. The mother alleged the husband's s. 8 expenses were increased because he was paying less child support and were not performing his obligations under the Act. HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to contribute to the parties', including the payment of bingo proceeds, was terminated effective March 31, 2003. The parties' second child, who was not enrolled in school, was paying hockey and golf expenses and the husband was paying soccer and baseball expenses. The issues were whether the wife's s., 7 and 8 expenses should be increased pursuant to the consent judgment, whether the husband should have an obligation to pay more child support, whether his s. 9 expenses should not be increased and whether the spouse's s.(7) contribution should be reduced. 2)The wife's position warranted an assessment of costs. The law is well-settled that the pursuit of post-secondary education may be a sufficient reason for an adult child's inability to withdraw from their parent's charge or to obtain the necessaries of life. The facts were not in dispute. The father's income had increased since the May 2, 2002 consent order and the wife had received employment insurance benefits in 1999 and 2000. The child had been in full-time attendance at a post-school. The family law judge found that the burden of proving a change in income which would constitute a change of circumstance lies with the wife. The unreasonableness of her position warrants an assessment. Costs provided some compensation for the wife for the loss of employment insurance."
e_2004nspc8.txt,"The defendant applied for a stay of proceedings on the basis of a violation of his right to be tried in a reasonable time. There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial. Stay of proceedings granted. At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.","This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter.

The Defense had verballyized an intention to raise s. 8 and s. 9 Charter motions and lead evidence. The Crown objected and the accused waived his right to a trial. HELD: The application was stayed.  1)The length of the delay was well outside the 8-10 month guideline established in Morin. 2)The applicant asserted his right of a speedy trial by requesting the first trial date. He retained counsel and was prepared to fight the merits of the case at trial. 3)Prejudice to the accused may be inferred. The length of delay is likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered given the passage of time that has occurred since the charges were filed. 4)The administration of justice was at stake. The court must be mindful of the rights s.11(b)(i) and s7 of the charter and the societal right to bring those accused of crime to trial. 5)The longer the delay the greater the risk that the evidence given by witnesses may not be as reliable as it might be, due to fading memories. 6)Pre-trial Arguments and Lead Evidence The length delay is not likely to affect the quality or quantity of evidence tended to be tendered.

While a chambers judge acting under s. 20 of The Court of Appeal Act may not have the independent authority to make a maintenance order, a chambers judge has the authority to stay a judgment in its entirety in the Court of Queen's Bench in certain cases as long as doing so does not decide the appeal. The Court of Appeal stayed the decision of Klebuc J., which left the order of Wright in place, which maintained the existing maintenance obligation.","HELD: On this application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 on the judgment of Klebuc J. dated February 25, 2004, the Court declined to do so for these reasons. The application parallels that of Gerwing J.A., who decided on February 25th, prior to the final reasons being filed, not to lift or to maintain the schedule existing prior to their decision under appeal. Since oral argument, when the mother assumed that maintenance would be paid, the father's counsel filed a detailed brief arguing that staying the execution of Klebbuc J.'s judgment did not revive the prior maintenance order and that a Court of Appeal chambers judge does not have the authority to make such an order. HELD: The application to stay the execution by Rule15 on the judgement of Kleebuc J., which gives the mother custody of the children for slightly more than 50% of the time, leaves the effect of the order declining to lift it.

e_2004skpc82.txt,"The accused youth is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions.

The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges.  1)The Court found that the accused was not displaying any symptoms of impairment. The only signs of impairment were his blood alcohol consumption, a very strong smell of alcohol and a flushed face. 2)The accused had not been smoking marijuana. The accused's appearance was somewhat flushed and his breath smelled of alcohol. 3)The court found that if the accused had been drinking alcohol the day before, the only reliable indicia of impairment would be his lack of sleep and his inability to control his emotions. 4)The evidence of an impairment was not credible. The Court rejected the accused's suggestion that he was smoking marijuana or that he had a nervous face. 5)The only medical evidence offered was that the blood alcohol content of the accused in the car was at least 140 milligrams. 6)The Crown did not provide an explanation for the inconsistencies in the driving behaviour of the witnesses. The court found a reasonable explanation for them (smoke, alcohol, cigarette, beer, marijuana) but it was not enough to establish impairment.  7)The officer was not required to testify. The Crown must prove the scientific basis for the tests, the proper method of application and to comment on their reliability. The officer was entitled to leave the court to deal with the issue of guilt or innocence to the prejudice of the victim."

The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered. The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct.

The accused was found guilty of both counts. HELD: The accused is guilty. 1) The court found no reasonable doubt as to the intention of the accused. The criminal conduct of the parties was dangerous to public and the offence of driving a vehicle that is dangerous to one or more of the others was beyond the reasonable doubt. 2) The accused operated the motor vehicle erratically and in a way that is unnecessary and dangerous to others. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct. The court accepted the evidence of the two accused's lawyers and the evidence that they were in the house when the incident occurred. The evidence of injuries sustained by the victim and the accused was accepted.

The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged that he committed a sexual assault on the complainant. HELD: The Court found that the accused was acquitted of all charges. The Court believed that the evidence established that the complainant was truthful and that, on the evidence that was heard, the accused had not been detained. There was no evidence that the witness had any sexual contact with the complainant prior to or during the assault. The complainant was clearly moved by the accused's comments. The accused was not surprised that the comments were made. The court found that, in light of the numerous incidents that had occurred between the parties, the same cannot be said about the events of August 2003."

The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action.

The flight was delayed for about an hour and half at the Punta Cana airport as a result of several evolving mechanical difficulties referred to by the pilot as 'creeping delay'. The defendants opposed the certification application on the basis that none of the five criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act had been met by the applicant. The plaintiff states that the plaintiff was negligent in not taking proper precautions and should have made alternate arrangements or taken additional precautions to ensure that there were no excessive delays. The airline was also negligent in failing to provide water and other essential supplies. Corrigendum received dated July 20, 2006 and added to fulltext. The court found that although the applicant's claim did not disclose a cause of action, it was not very high onus on him to satisfy the Court that the pleadings disclose cause of Action. The test to be applied in certification applications is similar to those used in applications to strike statement of claim as disclosing no cause of actions. HELD: The certification application was dismissed. 1)The test to apply in certification application is similar in applications in applications that are used in a strike statement as a claim as a cause. The Court should be reluctant to deny a plaintiff his or her day in court. 2)Although no specific case law was provided to the Court with regard to the Montreal Convention of 1999, there is ample case law with regard its predecessor, the Warsaw Convention, as to its exclusive remedy for passengers. Such cases include the decision of Akehurst and Others v. Thomson Holidays Ltd. and Britannia Airways Ltd. which involved a claim against commercial passenger airline (Britannia) and package operator (Thomson) arising from a crash landing. Although the Court would have dismissed the certification request on the sole basis of not meeting the criteria as outlined in s6(a), for reasons that will be thoroughly canvassed in this judgment, it would have also dismissed the application on that basis of the other criteria as listed in s7(2)(b) of liability.

e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the certificate is excluded. 1) The respondent's right under s.(9) Charter rights was not breached. The trial judge gave unequivocal and unequivocal warning to the police that he had not been given the opportunity to obtain advice from a lawyer once he changed his mind about seeking legal advice. The Crown did not provide the defence that the defence lawyer had not provided him with the information he required to obtain an unequivocal waiver. The defence is that the Crown did err in not providing the defence with the evidence that the respondent had changed his minds about seeking counsel. 2) The trial court judge gave an unequivic warning to police, who were required to tell the detainee of his right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and of the obligation on the part of the police to refrain from having them participate in any process that would incriminate him. The evidence clearly indicated that the accused had changed. The police were required, once they received the information, to tell him of his rights under (9) and (10) of s. 11(b). The Crown was not required to provide the evidence on the evidence. The appeal court was satisfied that the trial judge had misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Prosper. 3) The Crown has not proven that the breach of the respondent’s s. 9(b)(w) rights was caused by the failure of the Crown to provide an unequiv unequivocal Warning. The Court of Appeal was satisfied the Crown had not shown that the burden of establishing that the Respondent gave an unambiguous waiver when he changed mind about pursuing legal advice was on the Crown."
e_2006skqb534.txt,"The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.",The respondent applies to vary child support orders and/or alleged agreement struck by the petitioner and the respondent in or about July 2003. The respondent seeks to vary the child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act and pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act. HELD: The application to vary is dismissed. 1) The petitioner and respondent agreed in 1999 that they would continue to have joint custody of the children. The primary residence of the two children was with the respondent. The petitioner was provided reasonable access. 2) The respondent did not seek a variation earlier. He accepted $380 per month as fair level of child support. 3) The court found that the respondent's delay in revising child support would not constitute a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. 4) The Court dismissed the respondent’s application for retroactive child support based on the evidence.  5) The increase in the respondent income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children.  6) The annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum are not so significant that the applicant would have expected such a dramatic increase. 7) The applicant’ s. 25 of the Guidelines and the Family Services Act do not apply in the circumstances. 8) The parties negotiated through their lawyers and the petitioner’d mother personally discussing the child’S health care needs and needs. 9) The administration of justice was not consulted. 10) The Supreme Court of Canada was not satisfied that the parties had reached an agreement on the child care needs. 11) The application for a retroactive order was dismissed.

HELD: The accused's continued detention is necessary for the protection of the public The Court puts significant weight on the accused's continued disregard of court orders and the fact that the number and severity of the assault incidents is increasing. The accused received the benefit of conditional sentence in April 2006 and in July was found to have breached the orders which formed part of the conditional sentence. He is now facing additional allegations of breach. Even though he was bound by conditional sentence and was charged with another violent offence, which is alleged to have occurred in September, he was once again released from custody in October.

The powers of judge on review application are set out in s.520(7) of The Criminal Code. They are the following: 520(7); 520(8); s. 530(7)(d) of which the Criminal code provides as follows: 1) It should be noted that the accused received the benefit of a conditional sentence in April 2006 and in July was found to have breached the orders that formed part of the conditional sentence. He is now facing additional allegations of breach of his undertaking. 2) The accused received a benefit of conditional sentence and in August was charged with another violent offence, which is alleged to have occurred in September, he was once again released from custody in October. This was followed by the allegation of another violent assault which is said to have happened in September. 3) The court put significant weight on the offender's continued disregard of court orders and fact that the number and severity of the assault incidents is increasing. The court found that the onus on the defendant to show a cause why is detention in the custody of him is justified."
e_2008nssc216.txt,"The applicant school teacher asked to be discharged from $20k in student loan debts under s.178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. He had filed consumer proposal in 2001, which he completed successfully in 2006. He earned $50,874 (gross) per annum; was at the top of his pay scale; had two young children; and his wife worked half-time position at Aliant, earning $16,272 year. There were daycare costs when the wife worked, and the applicant's transportation costs were high (but reasonable). The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards. The applicant did not have any credit either. Their home had little, if any, equity. The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan. Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability. If the application were refused, he would have to consider bankruptcy.","The applicant sought an order under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act that did not apply to his outstanding student loan debt. The application was opposed by the Attorney General of Canada. HELD: The application could not proceed as the applicant had not shown good faith in dealings with his student loans. The court found that the AttorneyGeneral did not question his good faith with respect to the loans. However, it contested whether he had and will continue to experience financial difficulty so as to be unable to pay the liabilities for the loan. The debt in effect can either be cancelled or affirmed."
e_2009nssc204.txt,"An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment. The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","The appellant was a student at the university when he sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the professor did not take the content of the attachment as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to cause death to the professor. The appellant contended the Crown had not properly explained the sender's intent and that the sender was a computer program. He also argued the sender sent the emails in a manner that was meant to intimidate and prejudicial to the appellant, but also argued that the Crown's evidence was rife with hearsay and very prejudicial. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The evidence was part of the 'narrative' and the Crown did not enter a formal or informal voir dire to determine if the witness had any relevant evidence. 2) The trial judge did not refer to the evidence as a prima facie threat. The evidence as to the sender’s intention was that he intended to get reaction from the reader of the email and that he included the words “to get reaction” in the meaning of “Get reaction.” 3) The appellant’ s s for and against were found not to be credible. The trial court did not consider the evidence of the sender as a witness. The issue was whether the sender had any relevance to the charges, and whether the evidence was sufficiently tainted by the messages that were sent. 4) The Crown did meet with the appellant and gave him a number of expert witnesses. The court reviewed the evidence and concluded that the evidence presented by the expert witnesses was not credible. 5) The court found that the appellant had not shown that the contents of the e-mail were threats to the integrity of the trial and was satisfied that the requisite intent had been established."
e_2009skca40.txt,"This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","This was an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant sought to set aside the transaction under various heads of contract law including duress, undue influence, unconscionability, equitable fraud and mistake. The trial judge made critical findings of fact, including comprehension and desire to provide benefit to the Clements. These findings were supported by candid admissions at trial. HELD: The appeals against both the Clement and the solicitors were dismissed. The Court found that the central facts of the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and conduct of the Cels was supported by probative evidence and the candid admissions of the applicant at trial, who was herself a daughter of the solicitor.  It was impossible for the Court of Appeal to interfere with the findings of facts. On these facts no possible attack on the contract exists. On the facts no case of breach of contract existed."
e_2010skca79.txt,"The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. Following a jury conviction, the applicant appealed his convictions and his sentence, arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter was too severe. The appellant also argued that the trial judge erred in questioning whether the applicant could have outrun the police officer in the driving trial. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally.  1) The issues identified by the appellant do not operate to make his convictions unreasonable. The trial judge warned the jury about the dangers of eye witness identification evidence. She underscored that an honest and apparently convincing witness can be mistaken on identification issues. 2) When the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that, if the applicant had been called, the trial officer would have had a better opportunity to see the driver of the white Tempo than the applicant. The jury was also not led to place particular reliance on an assessment of the applicant's credibility made by an RCMP officer who questioned him about possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court notes that R. v. Molsky, [2007] 1 W.W.R. 99, where the convictions turned exclusively on eye witness evidence, the convictions of the appellant and the sentence appeal were not unreasonable."
e_2011skqb134.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of using credit card data to fraudulently obtain services contrary to s. 342(3) of the Criminal Code, one count of fraud over $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1) of the Criminal Code for defrauding Sasktel of telephone services and one count of fraudulently personating various persons with intent to gain advantage for himself contrary to s. 403(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences. The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names. He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services. The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44. The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items. The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18. The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail. He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders. In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities. He plead guilty. HELD: A fit sentence in global terms for these offences would be 8 years and 6 months. The accused was given credit for 4 years and 9 months for the time he spent in custody. The accused was sentenced to 2 years and 3 months for the s. 342(3) offence, 1 year and 6 months consecutive for the offence under s. 380(1) and 2 years concurrent for the personation offence under s. 403(a). The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","The accused was charged with two counts of fraud. The Crown stayed counts and sentenced him to three years imprisonment. The sentences were increased to eight years and six months and a credit of four years and nine months respectively. The accused pleaded guilty to three counts of theft. The offences were complex and required participation by several individuals with the accused as the co-ordinator. The sentencing judge noted that the offences occurred while the accused was in custody and that it was important that he be sentenced because of the time he had spent on remand. HELD: The global sentence was reduced to four years plus nine months and the credit for time served on remands was increased by one year. The credit for 4 years and 9 months was given for time spent on custody and for the amount of time actually served. The discretion to grant credit remained with me despite s. 719(3) and (4) of the Criminal Code because the offences were committed and the charges brought before enactment of the section. 1) The gravity of the offences was very high because of a number of aggravating circumstances. The two schemes were pursued over a lengthy period of time and involved scores of transactions. 2) The two accused pleaded not guilty. While it was long time in coming, it has avoided lengthy trial and the attendant expense. What is even more important is that the accused had no income and would not have any for some time. 3) The accused pled guilty to two counts relating to the theft of goods and services. The counts relating the credit and the global sentence were met with a credit for four years, nine months, and the value of the goods and goods realized. 4) The sentences imposed were based on the offences being committed while the offender was in prison and were subject to a global sentence of eight years, six months, concurrent with the preceding sentences. 5) The offences fell within the definition of offences under s. 380(1)(a) of The Criminal Code. The offender had no means to pay the bills but had done so voluntarily. He had accepted a credit from the Crown for time already served on custody. The Credit for time actually spent on re-offences was one for double time. The defendant had no assets at the time of sentencing and had received credit for his time served overseas. The case law had no bearing on his sentence. The criminal record had been established in 1979 and had been continuous since 1979. It was not surprising that the sentencing judge suggested rehabilitation was not relevant. The cases that fell within s. 660(3"
e_2011skqb244.txt,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","The appellant appeals his conviction for impaired care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit of.08 contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argued the learned trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count, namely that the central Crown witness provided exculpatory evidence. The trial judge rejected the appellant's allegations that he had been drinking, had been in care and Control of the vehicle, and had been involved in a confrontation with the appellant. The Crown also appealed the conviction on the count of operating a motor Vehicle while his alcohol content over the legal line exceeded.08. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The trial court found that the appellant’s evidence concerning slurred speech was not evidence of impairment. The evidence of the deputy chief of police was not. 2) The learned trial court concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt sufficient evidence of impaired driving to meet the standard set out in Stellato. The learned judge did not resort to conjecture or speculation as suggested by the appellant; the Crown did not err in failing to establish that the evidence concerning the appellant had been objectively assessed. The respondent’ s s. 8 Charter rights were violated. 3) The conviction for impairment of a vehicle by reason of lack of motor skills or impairment by the manner of speaking was not an unsafe verdict. The convictions for impaired operation of a car and driving with an impairment of that degree were found to constitute an unsafe result."
e_2011skqb444.txt,"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and common assault. The court found that the accused’s actions were done in self-defence. The Court found that both the accused and the two alleged victims were inmates at the prison and that their actions were motivated by mutual respect and protection. The three elements of s. 34(2) had been established: 1) the subjective perception of the situation was subjective; 2) the accused believed that he was being treated unfairly; and 3) that the injuries were objectively foreseeable by the accused based on the situation that he perceives. The Crown had established that the existence of an actual assault was not a prerequisite for the defence under s.34(2). The three essential elements of the s.33(2): namely, the subjective perceptions of the accused, the evidence of corrections officers and the testimony of Knife were all found to support the accused. The accused had admitted to the alleged assault and admitted to it."
e_2012skpc161.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","The accused, a young person with a severe head injury, was sentenced to 24 months custody followed by a period of probation with credit for pre-sentence detention and a 6 month weapons prohibition. The Crown applied under section 42(9) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act for a determination that the aggravated assault be designated as a serious violent offence. The accused was prohibited from owning firearms and had a previous criminal record of non-compliance. The defence opposed the accused’s application for a DNA sample. HELD: The young person was sentenced for a secure custodial sentence of 24 months to be followed by probation with a credit for time spent in detention and 6 months community supervision. An additional period of 18 months was ordered to be served in closed custody followed 1 year of community supervision and 6 month community supervision with credit to the YCJA for a period. 1) The young accused had extreme, violent and threatening behaviour. The impact on the victim and his family was life-altering. 2) The accused had been subject to release conditions in relation to a weapons offence. His record of findings of guilt, while not particularly reflective of violence, indicated lack of compliance with court orders. 3) The offence was a serious, foreseeable and foreseeable act. The harm to the victim was intentional and foreseeable. The young offender did not oppose the Crown’S application."

e_2013skca1.txt,"The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","The proposed appellants applied to strike out the Chambers judge's Rule 173(c) order striking the within action on the basis that it was devoid of merit and lacked a common issue. They also opposed the certification of the within Action on the grounds that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and non-client. The Chambers judge dismissed the application and certified the action as a class action against all defendants. The proposed appellant then applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 for an order granting them leave to appeal from the certification order and his dismissal of their Rule 173 (c) application. They raised the following grounds in their proposed notice of appeal: 1) the Chambers lawyer erred in law in failing to apply the Ann's test; 2) the evidence of the representative plaintiffs and the tax opinions provided by the Chambers court was a source of conflicting evidence and was not a basis for an analysis by the Court of appeal of the commonality requirements of the Class Actions Act; 3) the Chamber judge erred by failing to consider and apply the policy considerations which may preclude or negate the finding of a duty of duty of a lawyer to non- client; and 4) the judge failed to properly apply the test in Re: Collections Inc. v. Toronto Dominion Bank (CanLII), 2010 ONSC 660 (CanlII), which held that common issues, including the relationship of the respondent and the class members (collectively the 'plaintiff') did not constitute a common ground within which an action could reasonably be certified. Allowing the appeal in part, that the Chambers law judge erreaves in law by failing in his analysis of the facts and issues affecting the parties and in his interpretation of the law applicable to the common law issues, the test for determining a duty for care applicable to a lawyer, non-consecutive or privileged, is not applicable to this particular individual and is not an analysis of common law or of the interplay between the parties, but rather an analysis and analysis of policy considerations applicable to all members of a class."
e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent seeks to expunge child support arrears that have accumulated as a result of his not paying child support for many years. He is 72 years old and practising internal medicine in the United States. He wants to expune the arrear from his wife, who is suffering from serious mental illness. HELD: 1) The respondent has not paid child support in the past 3 years. The wife, aged 63 years, is on long term disability. She is on a disability. The respondent's arrearns are fixed at $183,746. The Court reviewed the various court decisions and found that, in the absence of some special circumstance, arreARS should only be expunged where the respondent has established on a balance of probabilities that he cannot pay the arrenars. He did not pay child support willingly it had to be snatched away from him. 2) The father will have few lean years until he has paid off the arremars. Even if he has to work longer than he wants, he should receive the full amount that, but for his dodging his obligations, would have been available to him when she was raising their children. 3) The arreages accrued on two occasions are set-off at $180,742. The father's failure to pay child care support during the course of his career has not impacted his ability to pay them. The arrow arrearing on the 2001 order was set-offs at $115,747. 4) The petitioner is on an ongoing disability. Her disability means that she is unable to put her children into extracurricular activities. 5) The husband's failure not to pay support during his career as a medical doctor has had an adverse effect on his ability and ability to support his children. The court found that the husband's inability to pay the child support he owed during his lifetime was an undue hardship. The husband will have a few lean Years to pay off the childsupport arrearis. The children will be dependent on him for their care after they pass. The spouse will be unable to work long term. The child support obligation under the 2001 orders was reduced to $1,683. The petitioner will have to continue to care for the children for the rest of her life. The parties cannot afford to spend time in debt. The law as it pertains to imputed income has not changed. The principles of sufficiency and the application of the law to imputation of income has changed."

The accused’s conduct over the past 18 months satisfied the court on the balance of probabilities that hers was an exceptional case and that a curative discharge would not be contrary to the public interest. The court imposed numerous conditions on her, including that she could not have or consume alcohol and should report to a probation officer, receive addiction counselling, participate in AA meetings and provide proof of her attendance to her probation officer. Her driver’s license was cancelled and she was prohibited from driving for two years.","The accused entered guilty plea to one count of driving a motor vehicle while her blood alcohol content was over 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and asked to be granted a curative discharge pursuant to s. 255(5) of the Criminal Code.

e_2017skqb219.txt,"HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent. They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.","HELD: The court granted interim joint custody with the primary residence of the two children. The father sought an order that he have custody of them but her home be the children's primary residence. The grandmother was not opposed to the father having reasonable and liberal access. The issues were: 1) was the grandmother person of sufficient interest; 2) was it necessary for the father to provide the father with parenting time with the children; and 3) was there a reasonable chance that the children would be moved from the primary care of the grandmother to his primary care. The evidence from the parties' prior settlement conference did not dispute the mother's claim for declaration of parentage, her claim for child support or her request that the child be designated beneficiaries of any life insurance, pension or health care plan he owned; and 4) the grandmother was sufficient interest in having reasonable access with the boys. The court found that the grandmother had reasonable and ongoing support for the children."
