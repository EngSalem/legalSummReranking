d_1994canlii7605.txt,"The appellant was convicted of indecent assault against two young girls. He appealed on five grounds related to a substantial conflict in the evidence. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no error on the part of the trial judge in weighing the evidence.","The Court convicted the appellant of two counts of indecent assault against two of his two teenage complainants, who were living with his mother. The assaults took place in a trailer where the two girls were living. He was employed full-time and was not a user of drugs or alcohol. Shortly after the girls left home their mother moved in with them. There was a substantial conflict in the evidence, which resulted in a substantial conviction for the appellant. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeals, that the Court could not find any error on the part of the trial judge in conducting the trial or in weighing the evidence. The Court carefully considered the evidence of the witnesses, including the contradictions in the testimony of the accused."
5_2011skca26.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving and alleged that his estranged wife and daughter lied. The appellant had been represented at trial by experienced counsel but undertook the appeals himself. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appellant had not followed procedures that must be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving to the Court of Queen's Bench and, having failed, then appealed to this Court. He was convicted at trial on the basis of the testimony of his estranged wife and their daughter, whose accounts of what occurred were accepted by the trial judge. The trial judge found both to be credible witnesses. He also rejected the appellant's account, finding that he was not a credible witness. The appellant took the appeals himself. He contended he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice inasmuch as he was convicted of his own admission and, out of a desire for revenge, had lied about what occurred. He alleged the evidence consisted of tape recordings of conversations with his estranged Wife over the last several years, recordings that indicate she was out to get him and had intimidated their daughter into testifying against him. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally.  1)There are certain procedures that have to be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence. Otherwise, the courts are left with no basis upon which to act upon allegations of that nature. These procedures were not followed and there was nothing before the Court upon which it might act. 2)There is no tenable basis for allowing his appeal, setting aside his conviction, and ordering a new trial. On the facts as found by trial judge, based on the judge's assessments of credibility, the conduct of the accused amounted to dangerous driving within the meaning of the Criminal Code."
6_2010nssc154.txt,"The corporate defendant moved (under Rule 44.10 of the 2008 Rules) for an order terminating an attachment order made against it, and under Rule 32.02(3) to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor. The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","The plaintiff, Sierra Forestry, moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it pursuant to Rule 44.10(b) of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The plaintiff sought a change of place of the proceeding, from Halifax to Windsor, in the area where the dispute arose. The defendant, Sterling Farm, argued that the attachment order caused Sterling Farm to shut down and that it was trying to hinder or delay its creditors. The plaintiff, which operated out of Stewiacke, said neither party had a connection with Halifax and that the matter should be heard in Windsor, where it had been held for several years. In addition, it argued that a reference to another document was not the same as in a defence filed in an action. HELD: 1) The affidavit of February 28, 1991 did not properly incorporate the contents of the statement of claim. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is not sufficient reason to dispose of the corporate veil.  2) The plaintiff did not establish any of the grounds available under the rules governing attachment orders. The prothonotary filed in the cause was not a proven instrument under rule 44.02 and, therefore, could not be relied upon as supporting the admissibility of the claim. 3) Costs were awarded to the applicant in any event in the Cause."
6_2004skpc25.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level. The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'. There was no symbol with it. In the blank that followed was written '5000C'. This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed. The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","The accused is charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The police observed the accused blowing into something that she described as an 'intoxilyzer' at the detachment. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s258(1)(g) for the intended purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol levels. It indicates that the samples were taken at 2:40 and 3:01, with results of 120 and 110 milligram, respectively. There is an initialled change to the expression of the year from 19 to 2003. HELD: The accused's charge is dismissed. 1)It is not a requirement of s258 to be a requirement in order for a certificate to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out either in the certificate or be proven by other evidence. The technician described the model of an approved instrument as being somewhat different than the actual approved instrument. 2)The accused's case law does not state that it is a requirement that the instrument be identified. The use of a certificate is shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be afforded the Crown, it must be sufficiently advanced in circumstances to adequately identify the instrument. 3)There was insufficient evidence to conclude that the accused blew into the object designated for the purposes of identification. There was no medical evidence that it was used to identify the accused. 4)The certificate may be used to prove facts, not law. The instrument or type of instrument used is matter of fact; whether such an instrument is an approved is a matter of law. Considerable evidence and argument was directed to issues of evidence, such as R. v. Gibson (1992), 138 Sask.R. 88; 18 W.A.C. (2d) 222 (N.B.C.) and R. vs. Fox (2003), 514 Sask.L.R.(1d) 225 (Sask.W.A.). 5)The Certificate of Analysis was specifically not designated for identification. It was a standardization tool afforded to Parliament and the use of the certificate was not sufficiently advanced. The model did not adequately describe the instrument or adequately describe its use in circumstances. The Court could not rely upon the statutory weighting of the evidence with respect to the model. 6)There is insufficient evidence that the alleged approved instrument was designated for that purpose. 7)The Court must consider the following in R."
4_2007skqb51.txt,"FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","FIAT: The respondent applied for an interim order granting sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s. 7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, October 2005. While he acknowledged an obligation to pay child support and there was an issue as to his income and whether the interim order should be made retroactive. HELD: 1) The respondent was granted interim custody with specified access. The petitioner requested that the child support be based on his 2005 income. Given the age and circumstances of the children and the fact that the petitioner had not seen the children for ten months, it was uncontroverted that the father had not only not seen his children for 10 months, but had also stopped paying child support in the interim. The interim order was granted for retroactive child support of $185 per month.  2) The petitioner's income was substantially less than the respondent's 2006 income. There was no evidence that the respondent ever paid any child support for the period leading up to the separation. It was impossible on an interim basis to determine whether the $9,600 fell within Schedule III, Part of the Guidelines, being permitted a deduction pursuant to s. of the Income Tax Act or whether it is in fact a 'living allowance' as contemplated by s. 16 of The Child Tax Credit Act. 3) The parties entered into a verbal agreement in 2006 whereby the respondent would have access every third weekend from Saturday to Tuesday during his week off from work. The verbal agreement was not binding and the respondent was not prepared to vary the terms of the verbal agreement. 4) Retroactive support was granted to the petitioner. The respondent shall continue to pay monthly child support based on the petitioner's 2004 income. 5) The Court was satisfied in the circumstances that the parties had not established that the deceased's income is substantially smaller than that of the respondent. The deceased's annual income for 2006 was $86,870.57. The Court ordered that retroactive support should be granted retroactively to October 2005, as the petitioner was not having access to his children at that time.  6) The evidence before the Court was not sufficient to rebut the presumption that a presumption of joint custody is a presumption in interim circumstances."
d_2009nssm48.txt,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","This was an appeal by the landlord from an order of the Director which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy. It also denied the landlord's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the tenant effectively refused to renew for another year. The Landlord appealed. Appeal allowed; the tenancy has not been converted into a Month to Month tenancy because the landlord refused his consent in a timely manner. The reasons for the refusal to consent are not known. However, it is possible that the reasons given by the Residential Tenancies Officer in this case could have been either arbitrary or unreasonable. It is therefore appropriate that both parties have acted in good faith."
e_2003skqb286.txt,"FIAT. At issue was whether there a change of circumstances, which would warrant a variation of the 2002 child support order; whether the 18 year old continued to be a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act; does the father have an obligation to contribute to his daughter's riding lessons; the father's income for child support purposes; should the 17 year old son's s.7 expenses be increased; costs. HELD: 1)The daughter had ceased to be a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and the father's obligation to provide on-going support and his contribution for s.7 expenses relating to her riding lesson terminated in March 2003. 2)The father shall pay $308 per month for support of his son commencing April 1, 2003 and every month thereafter so long as he remains a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 3)The mother's application to increase the father's contribution for the son's extracurricular activities was dismissed. The father shall pay $54 per month for hockey expenses commencing June 2003 and every month thereafter. 4)The mother was to forthwith pay costs of the application fixed at $250.","FIAT. The husband sought to vary the May 2002 support order on the basis of his income had decreased as a result of being laid off from his employment and that the parties' oldest child, Jasmine, was no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. The wife opposed the application arguing the layoff was only temporary and that Jasmine continued to be a child of the marriage within the means of the Act. She also opposed the husband's application to increase his contribution for her son's extracurricular activities. HELD: 1)The husband's income had increased since the May 2, 2002 order because he was laid off his employment. The Court found that the marriage was well-settled that the pursuit of post-secondary education may be sufficient reason for an adult child to seek support. 2)The wife's s. 7 expenses had not been incurred for more than a year. The father's obligation to contribute to the child's riding lessons was terminated effective March 31, 2003. 3)The parties had agreed to continue support for their daughter for one year at the rate set out in the Federal Child Support Guidelines. 4)The burden of proving a change in income which would constitute a change within the definition of 'child of the Marriage' lies with the husband. The law is well-established that change in circumstances can be of such magnitude that if the court had known of the change in circumstance at the time the original order was granted, it would have been in different terms. The unreasonableness of the wife's position on the issue warrants an increase. The parties' current income for child support purposes is $30,285. 5)The father's contribution for Jasmine's riding lesson was terminated as of May 2003. 6)Costs were warranted in this case because the wife had not obtained employment insurance benefits in the amount of $37,219 and the husband was paying $60 per month in child support for the child. Should the husband have an obligation to pay for the children's s., 7 and sports expenses? Should the employer's contribution on the hockey and golf expenses be increased? 7)Whether the wife has any obligation to provide support to the children in the event of an accident or if the husband is paying child support in any event. 8)Whether any of these circumstances warranted a variation of the support order. 9)The applicant's contributions for the expenses were not increased. 10)If the wife followed through with her plan and the child attained the required level of education she"
5_2004skca60.txt,"The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of the Municipal Board Act. The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply abnormal obsolescence to the owner's property. The issues also relate to 15 other properties and as the issues are the same for each property they were decided by the Assessment Appeals Committee on one appeal. The Assessment Appeals Committee dismissed the appeals, finding the issue not to be a matter of the Assessor's Discretion but a matter of professional interpretation of data. The Committee found the Board of Revision did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err on the issue of abnormal obsolescence for size. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted on two questions of law.  1) Did the Committee err in its interpretation and application of the Saskatchewan Assessment Manual by failing to find that economic obsolescence for size must be categorized on a MAF by MAF basis? 2) Did the Committee err by failing to find the Assessor should have used the comparable unit method to determine whether an adjustment for obsolescence for size should be applied to the applicant's property? 3) On the use of invalid sales leave was denied on the basis the question of the sale is a question of fact and in argument the applicant said for its purposes the impugned sale did not matter. 4) Leave to appeal was denied on the issue of the standard of proof that there was no error demonstrated.","The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. The issue of the sale is a question question of fact and in argument the applicant said the impugned sale did not matter. Further on the record the Assessor was fully aware the sale was a portfolio sale, had contacted both the vendor and purchaser, and provided particulars of the sales verification form as part of the evidence to the Board. The question of standard of proof is not a question that should be dealt with lightly. Whether the Manual should be read as requiring assessors to consider abnormal obsolescence for size on a group by MAF group basis or, alternatively, by imposing an improper and unreasonable standard of Proof on the appellant is not decided by the Court. The issues related to 15 other properties and as the issues were the same for each property they were decided by The Court. 1)Leave to appeal was denied on the basis the sale had been impugnaged. The Assessor determined the specific MAF neighbourhoods based on industrial property sales. However, the assessment committee determined that the same MAF in each neighbourhood could capture only some of the economic obsolescences such that the abnormal economic and financial obsolescENCE could be a significant factor. 2)The use of invalid sales and the alleged improper onus or standard of proofs by the Committee were dismissed. Leave was granted on the issue of valuation and valuation. 3)Leave was granted to appeal on the ground that the sales were invalid and the question of the standard of prove was of such broad importance that it deserves the attention of and the determination by a higher authority irrespective of whether the judge has any doubt about the correctness of the tribunal's resolution 4)The Court found that although the Committee made an error in its decision, it did not err in failing to err in their interpretation of the Manual or by imposing a 'comparable and irreparable harm' on the applicant."

c_2005nsca147.txt,"The parties separated shortly after relocating from the United States to Nova Scotia. As part of the divorce, the Supreme Court ordered a division of assets. Both parties appealed the asset division; in the process, both parties sought to introduce fresh evidence. The wife also questioned the level of assistance offered by the trial judge to the husband who was self-represented at trial. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with the exception that the wife is to be given immediate access to her personal belongings; both applications to introduce fresh evidence dismissed; on the sparse record before him, the trial judge did not err in his division of assets and did not offer the husband unwarranted assistance as a self- represented litigant. Faced with two competing claims as to the amount of the proceeds of sale, if any, of one of the parties' properties, the trial judge committed no error in finding the amount owed to be half-way between the two claims and then setting it off against the amount owed to the other party.","Both litigants sought to introduce fresh evidence on appeal. The wife took issue with the division of assets and alleged that the judge misapplied the value of the assets held by the parties. She also sought a more favourable division of Assets and an entitlement to health insurance. The respondent husband also cross-appealed. He also sought credit for certain receivables he claimed were family debts he should collect and share.

The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon decisive or potentially decisive issue. 2)The court found no palpable or overriding error in the standard of review. 3)The evidence was either readily available at trial, irrelevant, or both. The judge found that the amount owed to the appellant by the wife was half way between what she was claiming was owed and what the respondent husband was claiming. 4)Although the judge's approach may appear arbitrary, this is sometimes necessary when it comes to assessing the standard for assessing the fairness of a division.

2007skqb376.txt,"The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated. The application is dismissed.","The petitioner asks the court to vary the child support order granted to the respondent by changing the primary residence of the child to be with the father. The father argues that there has now been a clear declaration in two separate writings of the oldest child's desire to have primary residence change from her father to her mother. Further, there is some evidence that the younger child wishes to also live with her mother or, at the least, live in the same residence as her older sister.

The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. Both parties appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract. The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation. Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant to provide banking, blending and lifting of coal at its coal preparation plant. The defendant was the successful bidder. The plaintiff sued for damages in the amount of $270,307.05 for negligent misstatement and breach of contract. The issues were whether the defendant erred in finding that it was in breach of the contract, in failing to find the plaintiff in negligent misstatition and in assessing damages as he did. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The plaintiff was awarded $10,000.05 as damages for loss of profits. 2)The defendant was awarded nothing. 3)The court found that the defendant had not committed a fundamental breach of a contract and that it did not rely on exclusion from liability provisions in the contract. 4)In the trial of the breach claim, the defendant admitted that it may have received more money than it was entitled to. However, it failed to establish that the plaintiff was forced to perform its obligations under the contract and suffered damages that were demonstrably greater than those alleged. 5)In addition to the plaintiff's claim for lost profits arising as a result of the defendant's termination, the court also found that negligence by the defendant on its part induced the plaintiff to enter a contract for which it was not entitled to rely on the exclusion of liability clause relating to its estimates. 6)In all, the plaintiff suffered damages in excess of $30 million. The court awarded the plaintiff $10 million in damages."

The court ordered the removal of the respondent as an executor in the grant of probate and ordered that the applicants remain as executors but that they should take no further steps to distribute the assets of the estate. It found that there were “special circumstances” within the meaning of s. 17 of The Administration of Estates Act. The respondent was entitled to challenge the validity of the will but not entitled to remain as an executor.,"FIAT: The applicants ask the Court to remove the respondent as executor of the estate. They seek a revocation of the grant of probate and an order that the Will be proven in solemn form and related relief. HELD: 1) The respondent is removed as an executor in a grant to them in respect of an October 15, 2015 Will of Edna Jones.  2) The Court has the jurisdiction to remove an executorian of an estate both pursuant to its inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s. 17 of The Administration of Estates Act. While there is dissension or disagreement between the executors and the court, there is no basis to conclude that they will not continue to do their duty.  3) In the case of the deceased's estate, the Court ordered that the respondent be removed as executrix in the grant to probate. The Court ordered the respondent to take no steps to distribute assets of the Estate or to finalize the administration of the will until February 15, 2018. The direction for the respondent and his wife to take out any steps to redistribute assets until February 16, 2018 is based upon the concept of 'other special circumstances'. There is no evidence that either of them have acted contrary to their obligations to administer the estate in accordance with the directions contained in the Will."

The court found that the judgment should be set aside as a matter of right because it was in excess of the amount due. The judgment was also set aside on the merits. It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action. As well, the defendant had provided an arguable defence to the claim in that it pled in its proposed defence of non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act. The delay had not caused the plaintiff irreparable harm.","HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to have the default judgment set aside. Pursuant to Rule 10-13 of The Queen's Bench Rules, the plaintiff applied to set aside the default judgement and sought leave to file a defence. Because the Sheriff holds funds seized under the enforcement proceedings following the entering of the default verdict, Sollows' counsel undertakes to request the Sheriff to continue to hold those funds pending further order of the Court. Pursus to Rule 11-13, the court exercised its judicial discretion and set aside Sollow's default judgment. The application was granted in any event of the cause on the basis that the default was set aside ex debito justitiae."

RCMP had investigated a tip that a large crop of marijuana plants was being grown on a private property located in a clearing off a woods road. They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants. At trial, the court held their right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure had been violated, and acquitted them. The Crown appealed the acquittal. Per Roscoe, J.A., Chipman, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that there was no s. 8 breach because the respondents did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the field where the marijuana crop was growing. The court reviewed case law regarding 'open fields', and 'uncultivated' lands, and adopted the reasoning in Oliver v. United States, 104 S.Ct.1735(1984) in reaching its conclusion. Per Pugsley, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that the respondents had a reasonable expectation of privacy in activities carried on by them on their private property. As there were no exigent circumstances, the search was not reasonable and the evidence should be excluded.","The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana contrary to s. 4(2) and (6) of the Narcotic Control Act. After the trial in Supreme Court, a voir dire was held to determine the admissibility of evidence obtained by the police as a result of the seizure of marijuana plants. The respondents appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge erred in concluding that the evidence was not admissible. The appeal should be allowed and a fresh trial ordered. In this case, the Crown admitted that the police had reasonable grounds for their belief that the property searched contained narcotics, that they only had a mere suspicion, and that the warrantless search violated their s. 8 Charter rights. The appellants argued that the Crown's admission that there was a prima facie breach of their rights was made in such a fashion as to exclude the evidence. Dismissing the appeal, that (1) the admission would not render the trial unfair; (2) there was no exigent circumstances on which the admission of the Crown could have been prejudicial; (3) the search was unreasonable and (4) the Crown had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the clearing where the marijuana plants were growing and (5) it was not necessary to determine if the searches were unreasonable; and (7) the appeal should proceed."
6_2005nsca65.txt,"Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information. The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences. Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered. The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences. If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal.","The Crown appeals from acquittals entered by the Provincial Court on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons. The Information alleged that police officers who were in attendance at a residence as a result of a fire were advised by firefighters of two sawed off shotguns in the home. The defence admitted that on May 30, 2003, the resident of the home where the firearms were found, was subject to an order prohibiting possession of firearms and that he was not the holder of an firearms licence. At trial, defence counsel brought a motion for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence of one of the elements of the offence, that is, the date of offence, to conform with the evidence. Crown counsel applied to amend the Information to conform to the evidence, and the trial judge granted the motion and entered acquittal on all charges. The appeal was allowed and the acquittalals were set aside and a new trial ordered. The reasons for granting the motion were so inadequate that they do not meet the test for sufficiency of reasons because they do Not provide any indication of why there was insufficient evidence."

Allowing the application, that although the wife upgraded her education during the marriage with encouragement and financial support from the husband, she was entitled to maintenance for an indefinite period. The court reviewed the means and needs of the parties and awarded spousal in addition to child maintenance. The court recognized the indirect financial consequences to a custodial parent in raising children.","The wife sought a divorce and maintenance for herself and the 5 year old daughter of the marriage. The parties had been married 10 years; the husband had worked long hours daily for 28 straight days during which he was confined to the oil rig and then had 28 days off.

The petitioner sought to have the Separation Agreement and Minutes of Settlement incorporated into a Corollary Relief Judgment so far as the jurisdiction of the court permits.

The claim was issued November 1, 1999 and is based in debt for goods and services provided to the defendant. The value of the claim is $521,283.99 and refers to provision of materials, products and services in 1995 and 1996. The statement of defence was filed November 12, 1999 and amended in 2002. In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary. A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48. In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided. Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference. There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case. The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short. While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance. Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial. The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action. The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied.","The defendant applied for the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The defendant had issued a consent order in 1999 which authorized the appointment of a Band Councillor as the proper representative for Ochapowace. The consent order was amended in 2002 to order the plaintiff to complete the undertakings given at the examination in November 2004. In June 2009, the Band Counsellor filed an application seeking dismissal for wantof prosecution, failure to complete undertakings or alternatively for an order compelling delivery of the sought after undertakings. The application for dismissal alleged that the delay was inordinate and that although the plaintiff was responsible for an inexcusable delay in pursuing its action, the delay did not reach the level of serious prejudice described in the ICC case. HELD: The plaintiff was permitted to pursue its claim.  1)The Court reviewed all the relevant facts and found that this was not a case where the application for dismissing for want for prosecution should be granted. 2)A delay of over five years in advancing the cause was definitely inexcusably and it was in the interests of justice that the claim proceed to trial notwithstanding the delay.  3)The plaintiff was awarded costs on a party/party basis notwithstanding the costs that may ultimately be ordered in the cause. 4)The defendant was cautioned to now proceed diligently and without delay. Failure to do so will no doubt cause the defendant to consider making a further application for dismissed. 5)The applicant was awarded his costs on party/partner basis notwithstanding costs.  6)Costs awarded were referred to the Local Registrar."
5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving and one count of having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol content exceeded.08. The accused had been found to have been in care or control of the vehicle at the scene of the accident. At issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(3)(b) of the Code and whether the accused's ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. 1)The accused had reasonable, probable grounds in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand. He considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the potential seriousness of the injury, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. The evidence established that the accused was incapable of providing a sample of his breath due to his condition. 2)The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. He wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any demand. The totality of the evidence would lead any reasonable person to that conclusion. The officer was also cognizant of the fact the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it impractical to put him before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code."

At some point during the proposal Mr. White defaulted. The proposal was deemed to be annulled. PWC was taxed and allowed in the appropriate amount and the excess monies should be distributed to the creditor's, who should be advised that their original debts remain receivable. This was an application to tax a trustee's account. The debtor made the consumer proposal (which was accepted) accepted by the creditors and Mr.White defaulted, at which point PWC (PWC) was appointed trustee. At the relevant time, Mr.white defaulted and PWC paid the trustee's fee. At this point, the debtor sent monies to PWC with the intention those monies would be returned to the debtor's creditors. To that extent the trustee acts as the debtor’s agent. PW as agent has an obligation to disburse those monied monies as was the intention of the debtor. The excess monied should be redistributed to the creditors. The court found that PWC should only be entitled to a fee given that the trustee accepted payments after the deemed annulment. Those amounts received after the consumer proposals were deemed invalid were not subject to a trustee’ s fee. What should PWC do with the monies received from the debtor after the default? It seems to me that the debtor did send these monies back to the trustee with the intent those monIES be distributed the debtor to the other creditors as was their intention. To the extent the debtor acted as debtor”s agent PWC as agent should disburse these monied funds to the victims as was intended by the debtor as well as the creditors; the court also considered that the amount received from creditors after the proposal was enacted could only be based on the amounts received by PWC under the provisions of the consumer propose. Those amount received after payment was deemed invalid are not be subject to A trustee“s fee.  The court also weighed in on the administration costs."

The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act. 2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy. The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused. 3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan. 4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer. In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan. There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension.","The applicant sought a declaration under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act that her interest in a group registered retirement savings plan (later defined as the 'Group Plan') was not subject to a security interest she granted to Crown Life. She further sought an order restraining Crown Life from arbitrarily cancelling her participation in the Group Plan. HELD: 1)Section 146(2)(c.3) of the Act does not apply to the applicant. Since the applicant has not retired and no pension refund exists, there appears to be no monetary sum current for Crown Life to set off, unless a proper request for a transfer has been made by the applicant by her. 2)The provisions of s. 146(12) and s.57 of the PPSA do not apply. 3)The loan agreement contains no provision enabling the applicant to collapse the applicant's account in the group plan and thereby create an attachable pension refund. If it did, such provision would violate s.146(12). 4)The applicant's application for a restraining order was denied. 5)The application for the declaration was dismissed. 6)The provision in s.7.02 of the Income Tax Act had no application to the application for registration. 7)The only application for an order directing a transfer of the interest to a third party contravenes s.147(2) and is not enforceable. 8(1)The proposal to attach the resulting proceeds of the Group plan to the RRIF was not made in accordance with the provisions of the Plan Contract. 9(1)(c) and (8) were not dismissed. 10)Since the applicant had not retired, there was no evidence of her having retired, or of any other interest under the plan, the proposal to transfer the interest in the GPSA to another depository does not comply with s.150 of the ITA. 11(12)(c)(3) and 13) were dismissed. 12)The legal effect of the loan agreement is similar to the security arrangements discussed in McMahon v.

They agreed to an order of joint custody with the primary residence being with the mother. The petitioner wishes to move with the child from Saskatoon to Edmonton and Harley is opposed to such a move. The issues on the proposed relocation are whether it is in the best interests of the baby to relocate with the parent; if so, what is an appropriate access schedule for the child to be with the petitioner. HELD: 1) The child's psychological parent and their psychological home was with the respondent. The respondent's plans for the future of their child's care in Edmonton are vague and vague. Based on the loss of Harley as an active co-parent coupled with Charlene's vague and uncertain plans for his care, the child is not allowed to relocate to Edmonton. 2) The respondent has declined to allow the child's relocation to Edmonton because he is not an access parent. The court reviewed the history of the respondent and the child and found that the respondent's reasons for relocating were only relevant in exceptional circumstances where it impacts on that parent's ability to meet the child’s needs. 3) The court was cognizant of the psychological benefits of relocation. It was not necessary to deal with this as the petitioner had declined to exercise any of her discretionary time. 4) The evidence on the best interest of both parties was that the petitioner would lose the bond she now had with Harley. 5) The petitioner was not prepared to relocate because of the petitioner’ s vague and incomplete plans for their child. The evidence was that if the respondent was allowed to move to Edmonton, it would be in the children best interests to allow him to relocate. 6) The applicant was not able to move because of her new circumstances. 7) The Court was mindful of the comments in Gordon v. Goertz, [1996] S.C.R. 27 where the mother was granted access by Harley to her home. 8) The application judge was aware of the fact that the child had not had a further significant event since January 2003 and he had a roommate who also resided at that home. 9) The issue of the relocation was whether it was in best interests for the petitioner to relocate the child so that Harley could have access with the dog on any given weekend. 10) Based on this evidence, the respondent would no longer benefit from Harley's co- parenting arrangements. 11) The principles of best interests and the ideal of maximizing beneficial contact between the parties should be considered in"

He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in the proceeding, there were also questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial. HELD: The tapes were admitted. They spoke volumes about the father's character and motivations while shedding little light on the mother. The audio evidence showed that the mother was prone to violent temper tantrums and the parties had aprotracted pattern of dysfunctional, conflictual communication. Only by hearing the tapes, could the Court truly understand the petitioner's violent nature and her dysfunctional relationships with the children. The preservation of the evidence by the court was of the view that the tapes would have the opposite effect as the father’s videotaped conversations with his children which he claimed would demonstrate the level of abuse occurring in the mother”s home. The tapes had the opposite affect as the mother would typically have the parties’ attention and the audio evidence would not be relevant to the court. The videotape evidence was that the father was insistent the tapes were of central importance to his case and that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated the abuse that was occurring in his mother’S home. Hearsay: The evidence was not admitted."
3_1997canlii11217.txt,"Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them. The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996. The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions.","The petitioner brothers were three brothers from the District of Perdue, Saskatchewan who carried on a family farm operation and operated a farm implement dealership business. In 1985, the accountant for the petitioner firm recommended that they become involved in certain real estate partnerships, in order to derive certain tax advantages. The petitioner accountant, who had advised the brothers that they should become involved, advised them that they would need to make significant capital contributions to the partnerships in order for them to meet their partnership obligations. In the years between 1989 and the present date, the petitioner brothers have continued to conduct themselves as equal members of a real estate partnership who are each entitled to their respective share of profits and who are liable for their respective shares of the loses. HELD: 1)The petitioner was indebted to the petitioner in the amounts claimed. It was common ground that the petitioner had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. No adequate explanation was offered for his failure to pay his obligations.  2)There was no extenuating circumstances which would warrant the Court refusing to grant a receiving order.  3)As the petitioner was awealthy individual who was quite capable of paying his debts but had simply chosen not to do so. He earned over $1.4 million dollars in his last four years as professional hockey player in the NHL and claimed business losses of $50,286.77 as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships. He had received substantial tax advantages as a consequence of his participation in them."
4_2015skca111.txt,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. In this case, the court found that Turcotte J. had the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 Variation Order for retroactive child support in the amount of $21,645 and costs in the figure of $1,500. The court found in this case that Turcottte J. could not overturn a decision of a Queen’s Bench judge dealing with the same lis. In addition, the trial judge found that the parties had agreed in accordance with their prior agreement that retroactive support should be based on the amount paid in the form of a variation order. In the alternative, the respondent could not unilaterally vary the 2006 Variation order nor could he make an order to “relieve injustices”. The Court of Appeal also held that in the area of family support orders, the courts draw a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. The appeal court also found that in 2014 SKQB 334, it was held that the respondent erred by misapprehending the facts when he found the respondent did not advise her of changes to his circumstances. The respondent should not have instructed his solicitor to consent to it. In 2015 SKQB 338, the same court held in Frey that there is no expressly legislated power to vary an interim order on an application pursuant to the equivalent of s. 17 of the Divorce Act. The question is, what the jurisdiction is of this matter? HELD: 1) The court held that it was not necessary to find a material change in circumstances prior to the variation order as it was a final order and was subject to further determination by the Court. Whether the Court can vary an interim or final order on a child support is governed not by common law principles, but by the Division of Base and Limestone Law. Section 15.1 and 17 confer the jurisdiction on the Court of Queen”s Bench in this province. The words of provision must be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object and intention of Parliament. Given the wording of the 2006 Consent Child Support Order, which does not direct that an adjustment should be made as of a particular date, that issue does not arise in this appeal. 2) The Court was not asked to overrule Frey, nor do they think it is necessary to consider doing so. The trial judge made no errors in the"
6_2004skca37.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows:[1] We do not need to hear from counsel for the respondent. I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'. He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them. [5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5. [6] We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access. The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise. The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child.","The appellant appealed the trial judge's decision regarding custody and access.

2_2010skpc149.txt,"The accused were both charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault. The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.","The two accused were charged on separate informations with assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and with wilfully damaging the windows of a car. HELD: The accused were found guilty of assault contrary to ss. 266 and s. 430(4) of the Code. The Court found that both accused were the main aggressors throughout. He smashed in one, if not two, car windows and then chased after the complainant with Dagenais' help. Once at the trailer, he heard the complainant say that she felt threatened. He stopped the car and at that moment his front passenger's side window was smashed in. The accused then proceeded to punch the complainant in the face three times and then back up the stairs toward the trailer. The complainant said that he and Dagenaises got into a fight and Dagendais kicked the complainant three times. The Crown was unable to prove the cost of repairing the windows was under $5,000. The second count was found on information 24414281. The third count was convicted of second degree assault contraryto s. 387(4). The Court gave the reasons for the convictions."
c_2004nsca135.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, with the only live issue at trial being whether the Crown had proved the absence of the complainant's consent beyond a reasonable doubt. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review. The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt. It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence.","A cocaine fuelled encounter between the appellant and the woman with whom he was living resulted in his conviction for assault and sexual assault. He appealed the conviction submitting that it was unreasonable, was based on misapplication of the burden of proof and that the judge's reasons were so deficient as to constitute an error of law. The appeal was dismissed as there was ample evidence which supported the conviction. The judge applied the proper test and did not apply his or her mind to the possibility that despite having rejected the evidence of the appellant, there might nevertheless be a reasonable doubt about guilt."

3_2002skca56.txt,"A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users. A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services). The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order. It retained jurisdiction to confirm compliance. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date.","The appellant appeals a decision of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code Board which found that the appellant continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services to wheelchair users and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet the accessibility requirements of the National Building Code of Canada 1995. The appellant appeals the decision of Matheson J. (who in turn is the sole director and in de facto control) confirming the second decision of that Board.

b_2007nsca75.txt,"A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway. When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed. Appeal dismissed. At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit. It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit. Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.","The plaintiff was granted leave to appeal a decision dismissing its summary judgment application. The chambers judge found that the plaintiff had met the test for summary judgment and then that the plaintiffs met the onus on them to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident. The onus was also placed on the plaintiff to prove the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events, and if their evidence was accepted by a trier of fact, their action had some merit. The application for summary judgement was dismissed on the ground that the chambers judge blurred two parts of the test: 1) the first part was met; 2) the plaintiff met the burden placed upon him in the second part by establishing that the dog that ran onto the highway was actually the same dog that had been hit by the car; and 3) there was no evidence of credibility raised by the plaintiff's statement on the facts. The statements were signed by the defendant without reading all of the statement and the defendant actually told the plaintiff he could not identify the dog. The defendant argued that he signed the statement given to him by the Chambers judge and he actually told him he could. The Chambers judge brushed off the evidence, noting that there was at least a genuine issue of fact to be determined at trial. The issue of credibility was not the focus of the application but rather a matter of fact."

8_2015skqb144.txt,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The petitioner was granted interim shared custody with the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support. The petitioner’s petition for division of property, joint custody of Z., specified and supervised parenting time and costs were granted. The applicant also brought an amendment to the interim custody order in order to tide things over until trial could be held. The interim agreement provided that the petitioner would have Z. in the interim care of the petitioner and the respondent would have access to his mother. The parties had separated in November 2012. The child was born in December 2012. Throughout the relationship, the petitioner said the respondent had verbally abused the child and had threatened to take it out on him. He denied any contact with the child, claimed that the child was his responsibility, and that he had no money to give him. The evidence showed that the parties followed the interim orders and then ordered an expedited pre-trial conference to have everything put together and sent over before anything else could occur. HELD: 1)The petitioner was concerned that the respondent was holding the child from her and that she was unable to get him to come to her house. She telephoned the respondent the next morning principally to try and get the child back. 2)The respondent was not working and was in constant pain. He refused to take the child to the hospital. 3)All communication went through their lawyers. 4)The parties had been locked out since the December 2012 order. 5)It was clear from the outset that the issues between the parties were not being resolved that a reasonable solution was to have the child live with the petitioner rather than have him move with her to another residence. 6)There was nothing wrong with the basic premise of the petition: that a child should be in the custody of his mother so that she could come pick him up from her house at the appropriate time. The administration of justice was also discussed. 6).The petitioner had no claim to the parenting time of the child. The relationship was fostered by the fact that the two parties had not spoken for some time. There was a significant amount of conflicting affidavit material filed. 7)The evidence was that the father had not been paying child support for the petitioner for the past 3 years. He was using the money he was given to pay the lawyer for the duration of the agreement. The lawyer was not able to contact the child for several days because of the difficulty in reaching the agreed-upon time limit. 8)There were no reasonable"
b_1997canlii11375.txt,"The plaintiff, a specialty seed marketing company, claimed damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. Johnson Seeds entered contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting to secure product for resale. After extended negotiations the defendant eventually signed and mailed the standard form contract but never received an executed copy. The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993. The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price. HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action. 1)There was a valid contract between the parties. Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract. 2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract. The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone. There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94. The formal contract did not expressly set forth these conditions. Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.  4)Farr took a calculated risk and sold the seed which alleviated his immediate cash-flow problem.

The plaintiff Seeds then entered into contracts with the purchasers prior to seeding and harvesting of the same. The contract stipulated that the plaintiff should receive a copy of the executed agreement when the contract was executed.

The post office was legitimate agent of Johnson Seeds for the purpose of communicating the acceptance of the offer and the confirmation that the contract did exist. 3)The contract was not binding. The defendant communicated in person, by telephone, by fax and by mail. There was no doubt that in the telephone conversations between the parties they verbally confirmed that a contract existed. 4)Although it may have been in the reasonable contemplation of the plaintiff that he would receive back a fully executed copy of a contract, there is no doubt he verbally confirmed it was true. The telephoning, telephone conversations, the telephone calls all refer to discussions about overage on the contract when in fact the production was less that contracted for. 5)The evidence from the post office and in telephone conversations confirmed the contract had been executed.  6)Costs were awarded to the plaintiff for the breach of contract. 7)Each party was entitled to its own costs."

The balance of issues was: 1)A judgment issued dealing with the issues of division of property. 2)The respondent had taken great number of assets with him. He had not even unpacked a good part of what he took away. 3)Since the respondent did not want to cooperate, the court was left with no alternative but to assist the petitioner in regaining the assets taken out of the house by granting the order sought subject to one or two modifications. 4)The court had varied its judgment and given directions on how the judgment should be carried out whether or not a formal order was issued by the Court."
b_2010nssc125.txt,"The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","The plaintiff's employer suspended him from work without pay following the laying of criminal charges. They offered, however at their expense, the use of their legal counsel to defend the plaintiff. The plaintiff objected to the admission of the video re-enactment and the still photographs, as well as the opinions given by the RCMP Traffic Analyst regarding the amount of time that someone would have had to see the Chrysler and stop their vehicle. At trial, the plaintiff argued that the Crown's theory of the accident was fatally flawed and that his expert's opinion should not have been introduced by the Crown. He also argued that there was a conflict of interest between the plaintiff and his employers. Dismissing the action for negligence and breach of contract, that the video was a very good example of how the facts presented to the jury could be explained. It was also a very timely appeal, which allowed the Court to review the expert's report and find that, in some respects, the video's admission should have been made sooner rather than later."
c_2006skpc93.txt,"The plaintiff alleges the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and has caused the plaintiff humiliation and distress, through her actions as Reeve of the Council of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood. The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions. The plaintiff is a councillor. The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act. There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council. The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council. The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the parties is a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. 2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful. This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care. Her actions were not negligent.","The plaintiff sought general and aggravated damages for injuries suffered as a result of her actions as Reeve of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood. The R.M. councillor sought to remedy the situation by declaring a conflict of interest and leaving the meeting. The administrator of the municipality advised council that the plaintiff had moved a motion to tender the contract for building inspection services which had failed to comply with the plaintiff's requests to remedy his deficiencies. Council convened to discuss the issue. During the meeting, the administrator received legal advice from the mayor's administrator regarding the possible conflict of interests and the plaintiff brought an application to have the administrator revoke the sanctions she had imposed upon her. Application to quash the sanctions dismissed; the plaintiff did have another remedy open to him, which was to apply to the action against the defendant. The defendant was acting in her personal capacity and did not act in good faith in imposing the sanctions. The plaintiff failed to establish that she acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff; the defendant is not liable to the plaintiff pursuant to the tort of misfeasance in public office. HELD: The claim was dismissed. The court was not prepared to award damages to the defendant and enable him to gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. 1)The dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant was a political one. A court should not be reluctant to get involved. The dispute is best left to the ratepayers to deal with at municipal election.  2)The plaintiff was not seeking damages for her actions. She was acting with the express purpose of demonstrating a personal injury to her reputation and feelings, and thus causing her to gain personal benefit. She did not establish that the defendant acted with a sense of personal liability or that she had received legal guidance in her capacity in order to impose sanctions upon her in the course of carrying out her duties as councillor.  3)The court could not decide on damages or costs."

An oath taken before a commissioner or notary is as valid as it is before a provincial court judge and avoids all the possible problems that relate to personal attendance.

SaskTel was awarded its costs. 1) The power to strike out claims that have no reasonable prospect of success is valuable housekeeping measure essential to effective and fair litigation. It unclutters the proceedings, weeding out the hopeless claims and ensuring that those that have some chance of success go on to trial. 2) On an application to strike, the facts set forth in the Statement of claim are considered to be true unless manifestly incapable of proof.

At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol content greater than.08. The defence brought a motion to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, such evidence flowing from an invalid approved screening device demand, which infringed the accused's s.8 and s.9 Charter rights.

HELD: The accused was dismissed from the trial. 1)The words 'had consumed alcohol' were insufficient insufficient for the court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in her body at the time of the ASD demand. The threshold is far lower than the required belief to make a formal breath demand. 2)Evidence of consumption manifested by physical observation and/or through dialogue with the motorist may well provide such a reasonable person's reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body. 3)The wording of the section, however, is clear and unambiguous.

e_2006skqb534.txt,"The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the respondent’s position on the matter was not blameworthy. To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner category.  1)The respondent”s position was that he had agreed with the previous two consent orders that they would continue to share the custody and care of both of their children, Meghan and Ryan, as well as his special and/or extraordinary costs. 2)The petitioner”d not disclose her income tax return”(s. 25) or any current information about the status of the child” (failing to do so) within the meaning of s. 25 of the Guidelines. 3)There was no agreement or obligation to disclose. The petitioner had been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. 4)Relying on the Supreme Court” s. 15.1(7) for its reasoning, the court found that the petitioner was not in breach of the 2003 agreement. 5)The fact that the parties had agreed on the table amount for the child in 1996 was not grounds to vary the amount of support in 2004. The respondent“s delay between June 2004 and July 2006 (the first time the respondent broached the issue of revising child support by sending a letter to the petitioner) was a reasonable excuse for inaction.  6)Reasonable excuse for not seeking a variation was not sought. The annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum were not so significant that the mother would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 7)The court was unable to find any reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that he accepted $380."

The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility.

At the time of the appeal the plaintiff was awarded $420k.13 in a judgment for an overpayment of taxes. In the appeal it was held that the prejudgment interest of 8.75% being a rate equatable to the interest charged by HRM on overdue taxes, was an appropriate rate on the principal amount for the five month period between the Nova SCC assessment determination in March 1997 and the payment of the property tax refunds in September 1997 as well as on the unpaid interest until the date of judgment.  The plaintiff appealed the reduced assessment and sought interest on the amount overpaid. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to judgment for $420.13 for the three year period from the time it issued the first cheque (the 'overpayment' had not occurred until September 1997). A prejudgment interests claim was not available at the time the assessment was rendered and no order was provided for recovery of the overpayment.  1)The court found that proceeding under the Judicial Act does not create debt and an appropriate interest claim did exist under s.41(i)(i)(i)) of the Act. 2)The Court found that there was no right to a full refund of overpaid taxes until March 1997 when the Nova Nova Scotia court of appeal rendered its decision upholding the reduction in the assessment. An interest rate of 8% being an equalatable rate on that overpayment was not a appropriate rate. 3)Costs were awarded by way of brief written submissions.  4)The plaintiff could not bring an action for the loss of valuable property or damages until the appeal process concluded. 5)There was no cause of action for return of any over payment of taxes until after the appeal provisions of the Assessment Act had been exhausted.

e_2011skqb134.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of using credit card data to fraudulently obtain services contrary to s. 342(3) of the Criminal Code, one count of fraud over $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1) of the Criminal Code for defrauding Sasktel of telephone services and one count of fraudulently personating various persons with intent to gain advantage for himself contrary to s. 403(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences. The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names. He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services. The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44. The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items. The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18. The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail. He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders. In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities. He plead guilty. HELD: A fit sentence in global terms for these offences would be 8 years and 6 months. The accused was given credit for 4 years and 9 months for the time he spent in custody. The accused was sentenced to 2 years and 3 months for the s. 342(3) offence, 1 year and 6 months consecutive for the offence under s. 380(1) and 2 years concurrent for the personation offence under s. 403(a). The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","The accused was presented with an indictment containing five counts. At the arraignment the Crown stayed counts and gave him a credit of double time. The accused pled guilty to three counts. The count amounts to fraudulently and without colour of right, use credit card data that would enable a person to use a credit card or to obtain the services provided by the issuer of a Credit card to credit card users contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and two counts of theft of goods of a value exceeding $5,000. The credit should be one for one or put otherwise, the time actually served on remand. HELD: The accused was sentenced to four years and nine months and the global sentence should be reduced accordingly. 1) The offences were very high because of a number of aggravating circumstances. The offence was committed over a lengthy period of time and involved scores of transactions. There was pre-meditation and careful planning in advance. Several people were implicated in the criminal enterprise. 2) The accused pleaded guilty. While it was long time in coming, it has avoided lengthy trial and the attendant expense. What is more important is the dollar value of the goods and services realized and the total deprivation inflicted. 3) The Court held that sentencing the accused to consecutive sentences of eight years and six months would be a priority. 4) It would be perverse to deprive an offender of liberty when he is sentenced to two years and three months consecutive to the preceding sentences. 5) The Crown should have given a credit for four years, nine months, or a global sentence of 10 years and 9 months because the offences were committed and the charges brought before enactment of the section. The discretion to grant the credit remained with the Court despite s. 719(3) and (4) of The Criminal Code because they were both set-off in the context of the same criminal record. 6) The gravity of the offences was very high, because of the numerous offences and because the place from which the crimes originated. 7) The conduct of the accused was most unusual, even bizarre, as it occurred while he was in prison. It was decided that a fit global sentence would be 8 years and 6 months. The combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh; 7) the objectives of sentencing, as stated in the Code, are rehabilitation. 8) It is denunciation and deterrence, both accused and others, which must be emphasized and obtain a priority; any other approach would being the administration of justice into dis"
d_1995canlii4259.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Chambers judge arising out of an interpleader application by the respondent Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owing by the Band under a construction contract entered into with the respondent. The respondent had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specified to the various claimants. The learned trial judge held that s. 89(1) of the Indian Act was applicable and governed the issue he was required to consider. The Chambers judge also held that an assignment of book debt by another party, for the purposes of s. 5 of the Schedule II Rules, did not have to be registered under the Act. All assignments were to be made in writing and registered with the Registrar of Deeds."
6_2013nssc256.txt,"Rule 14.01 – Meaning of “relevant” in Part 5 The plaintiff brought a negligence action against the defendant, stemming from a 2007 fire in premises that the defendant had rented from the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought production of documents related to a 2009 fire at another location rented by the defendant. The defendant resisted on the basis that the documents were not relevant. Held, motion dismissed. Under Rule 14.01, the motions judge must decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. The party seeking production must establish relevance. Here, the only evidence was regarding the occurrence of the fires; there was no evidence as to the manner of the defendant's operation of the business in the second location that would establish relevance to the action regarding the first location. The commonality of a fire in separate buildings two years apart does not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating to the second fire.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant seeking damages, alleging negligence. After the fire, the defendant moved to another location and destroyed the plaintiff's building. The plaintiffs sued the defendant alleging negligence and sought production of all documents relating to the second fire. The defendant argued that, based on pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial, there was no evidence as to the manner of operation of the defendant's business in the second location that would establish relevance to the issues of negligence raised in the pleadings.

While a chambers judge acting under s. 20 of The Court of Appeal Act may not have the independent authority to make a maintenance order, a chambers judge has the authority to stay a judgment in its entirety in the Court of Queen's Bench in certain cases as long as doing so does not decide the appeal. The Court of Appeal stayed the decision of Klebuc J., which left the order of Wright in place, which maintained the existing maintenance obligation.","On this application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 on the judgment of Klebuc J. dated February 25, 2004, the court declined to do so for these reasons. The application parallels that of Gerwing J.A., who decided on February 25th, prior to the final reasons being filed, not to lift or to maintain the schedule existing prior to their decision under appeal. Since oral argument, when the mother assumed that maintenance would be paid, the father's counsel filed a detailed brief arguing that staying the execution of Klebbuc J.'s judgment did not revive the prior maintenance order and that a Court of Appeal chambers judge does not have the authority to make such an order. HELD: On this application, the Court of Queen's Bench decides whether it is appropriate to lift a stay in the event that a Queen’s Bench judge did not act in the light of the fact that this case was more like Faber v. Retzlaff,[1] Fiacco v. Fiacco[2] and Fick v. Fick [3] than Latsay v. Latsa,[4] Kuhn v. Bitternose, Burke v. Burke[6] and Murray v.

He had a previous record for non-violent offences., defendant sentenced to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment; aggravating factors included the defendant's possession and use of a handgun in an area where a number of people were close by and that a bullet had found its way into a nearby residence.","The two accused were jointly charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in relation to shootings committed in the early morning hours of December 10, 2006. The two accused remained in custody until October 2008 when they were released on judicial interim release under the Adult Bail Supervision Program. In this case, the accused served approximately 17 months of pre-trial custody while on remand and he should be credited 34 months for this dead time. The offence was particularly serious given the fact that the accused possessed a firearm at the time of the shootings and because of the fear instilled in the community by the presence and use of handguns. The accused had a prior criminal record for non-violent offences such as fraud, possession of a controlled substance and careless storage of a weapon. HELD: A sentence of 9 years should be imposed with a credit on a 2 for 1 basis for the accused's pre- trial custody and for the time spent on pre-rial release.  1) The Court must consider the nature and circumstances of the offence and the character of the accused in order to arrive at a fit and proper sentence. 2) An aggravating factor was that handguns were used in an area where a number of people were close by at the after hours bar known as Vegas. Quite a few shots were fired and two persons died as result of the gunfire. The offender was acquitted of the two count of murder. The sentences imposed were at the high end of the range set out by Blacklock J. in R. v. T.H. The principles of sentencing are set out in s.718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code. The offences were committed against a group of people. There was a serious threat to the safety and security of those living in the area as well as to those who were congregated on the outside porch of the bar shortly before the shooting. The presence of at least 2, probably handguns being used in the shooting was of significant consequence to the community."
b_2011skpc30.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care and control of a motor vehicle and care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.","The first issue before the court arises from the voir dire and concerns whether the Information to Obtain Blood samples contained sufficient grounds in support of the warrant. The Supreme Court of Canada has held that s. 8 of the Charter to be free from unreasonable search and seizure is breached. The warrant to search for blood samples issued in 2009 by the Justice of the Peace has been invalid. In this case, the Crown and the accused agreed that the officer who signed the information to obtain should testify on voir de for the purpose of the Court making its determination of the validity of the warrants and the admissibility of the Certificate of Analyst. The officer who prepared the information was granted leave to cross-examine on the information pursuant to s. 487.1(R. v. Garafoli), [2005] S.J. No. 300, and HELD: The officer swore the information before the Justice at 3:30 a.m. on January 10, 2009. The Court held that this was a technical error and as a result there was a breach of the accused's s.8 rights. The Certificate of Analysis and the report were not admitted into evidence as they did not include the source of his belief that the driver of the vehicle was not wearing a seat belt and the rest of his body was slumped across the passenger's seat. As the officer failed to communicate this basic information to the Justice, the Court found that the warrant was invalid and there was an infringement of his rights as guaranteed by s.16 of the charter. The second issue arises as a potential ground for an application to quash the information obtained pursuant to the warrant and is whether the information is sufficient grounds to warrant a search warrant. This question must be assessed against the 'totality' test, looking to the whole information and excising any misleading parts. The section Charter right was breached, and the appropriate action to be taken under s.24(2) of the Code is to admit blood samples from the accused."

The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application. Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court, that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation. The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances.

The matter had been adjourned for several months at which time the respondent raised a jurisdictional question, arguing that the payment of the lump sum in 1985 fully and finally discharged his responsibility for child support. The Family Court appealed. At issue was whether an order for lump sum payments under the Children of Unmarried Parents Act can be varied. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The court had not decided on the merits of the merits or on the issues at issue. 2)Since the merger of the two courts, the designation of Supreme Court should be substituted for the reference in the statute to the County Court.  3)The order in question was a unique creation of the old Children ofUnmarried Parents' Act.

Applicant applied to strike out that portion of defence application allowed. The applicant applied for and was denied a pension. Therefore no pension was at this time payable to her. A review by the Minister would require new information and the appeal period had expired. The applicant should not be denied her right to proceed against the Crown in such circumstances.","The plaintiff was voluntarily released from the military after a seven year period following the sexual assault. She applied to Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) for a pension under s. 111 of the Pension Act. The Minister of Defence later reversed the decision and the plaintiff was barred from bringing this proceeding. She also failed to appeal. The limitation period for appealing the Minister's decision had expired and she was not in receipt of pension benefits. The Crown appealed the decision. In giving the plaintiff the benefit of a pension, the court noted that s. 11 of the Pensions Act provides a mechanism for the plaintiff to bring an action for damages against the Crown where a pension is being paid or is 'payable'. It was also inconceivable that having been denied the application for pension the plaintiff is precluded from bringing the proceeding because she failed to attend court in time. The court concluded that the section of the Act which provides for the equitable exchange of benefits between the employer and the defendant and for the purpose of this case, could not be read as imposing an obligation on the employee to apply for pension, and a further obligation upon him to prove that pension is not payable. The plaintiff must prove facts to bring the case within the ambit of the legislation."

The vessel was used as a charter vessel in Maine and Canada.

They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","HELD: The Court granted the application. It ordered the child to be registered in the Montessori program by the petitioner and begin attending as soon as the program was able to accommodate such attendance. The Court held that it would be in the children's best interests to have the matter proceed to a pre-trial conference as a stand-alone issue, even an expedited pre- trial conference. There was no reason for the denial of the divorce at this stage. The child had been in the petitioner’s program for in excess of one year and the petitioner was in the position to pay the cost of that program."
4_1994canlii5048.txt,"The Crown elected to proceed summarily and the accused entered a plea of guilty to a charge of assault under S.266 of the Code. He was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment, 18 months probation and a 10 year fire arm prohibition was imposed. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)Because the accused had no related record and given the circumstances of the assault, the sentence of imprisonment was reduced to time already served (15 days). 2)The trial judge erred in imposing the 10 year fire arm prohibition under S.100 of the Code. S.100 requires a conviction on an indictable offence involving violence against a person where the maximum sentence available is 10 years imprisonment or more. 3)The maximum sentence for assault under S.266 is 5 years if the Crown proceeds by indictment and 6 months if, as here, the Crown proceeds summarily.","The accused was convicted of a summary conviction contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and a ten year firearm, ammunition and explosives prohibition order. At issue was a reduction in sentence to six months from the maximum term of imprisonment and a 10 year firearm prohibition order made against the accused pursuant to the provisions of s. 100(1) of the Code. The accused appealed the sentence which reduced his sentence to 6 months imprisonment and to 1 year probation subject only to amending the time within which the appellant was to report to the chief probation officer as provided. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The sentence was too severe for the particular circumstances and the sentence imposed ought to be reduced to time already served. 2)The accused had now served 15 days of the noted sentence. He commenced serving the sentence on August 4, 1994. 3)A ten year firearms, ammunition, explosives and prohibited substance prohibition order was made against him pursuant to s100(1). 4)The appeal against the sentence was allowed and it was set aside. 5)The sentences were reduced to terms equivalent to that observed in s.87 of s87 of the criminal code. 6)Each sentence was reduced to a term of 18 months on certain specific conditions. 7)The prohibition order did not exist in all the circumstances except those in the provicounty where a firearm prohibition Order was made pursuant to ss.9 and 10(b)of the Code and in particular in the 18 month probation order which was maintained subject to the terms and conditions set out in s87."
2006nssc139.txt,"The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage. The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment. The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child. The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home. Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity. The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","The wife commenced divorce proceedings in November 2004.She sought custody, access, child support, spousal support and costs with a division of property. The husband sought a variation of the provisions regarding child support and child support. It was his position that the particulars of the agreement did not and do not now reflect his net business income derived from self employment. The father sought an increase in access. The mother filed an answer and counter petition seeking custody/access, child care and costs. HELD: 1) The Separation Agreement was entered into to assure that his child would not be removed from his home town and that he was prepared to give her his equity in the home and guarantee her enough money per month to ensure she remained in the matrimonial home with his son. 2) The agreement clearly favours the mother. It is clearly unequal favouring the father. There is no evidence to suggest it was unconscionable. It's entirely foreseeable that mobility would become an issue at some point. The parties first arrived at an amount of child support which when combined would keep the mother in the jurisdiction. The capital cost allowance increased from $1,167 to $10,625 in 2004. The agreement purported to settle all matters between the parties and was to be incorporated into and form part of the Corollary Relief Judgement in this matter. 3) The parties had the opportunity to consult with independent counsel. There was no undue influence, fraud or evidence that would affect the ability of the parties to retain and instruct counsel. The evidence did not support the mother's unreasonable demands for more money to keep her and her child in the area. 4) The father agreed to terms in order to keep his child in their home and to ensure he was fully protected by the term of spousAL support that exceeded what he could manage. She failed to do so by explicitly indicating her intent that the conditional provision of a mobility restriction clause would protect her interests. It may be unfair in that it was obvious what he intended and wanted. It would clearly be unconscionsable if the mother were to become incensed at the father's encroachment on her home and move to Moncton, New Brunswick. 5) The court ought not to interfere with the agreement between the parents. However, in light of the fact that there are significant changes in the circumstances the court can review the terms of the separation agreement in this divorce proceeding and set an appropriate amount of support in this case."
3_2003skpc14.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drug (Code ss.253(a) and 255(1)). The accused admitted to consuming one vodka cooler before driving but argued the signs of impairment were manifestations of his panic attack. No .08 charge was laid, as his readings were .07 and .06. HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack. The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As stated in McCallum, the fact that the effects of alcohol may have been exacerbated by the accused suffering from fatigue does not provide a defence to the charge.",The accused was charged with having the care or control of a motor vehicle while his ability to operate a motor Vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The accused's evidence was to the effect that when stopped by the police he was suffering from a panic attack. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The evidence did not support the accused's diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (G.A.D.) or that his evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.  2)The accused's blood alcohol content was.60 and his reading was.70. The symptoms of impairment displayed by the accused were the manifestations of his panic attack not from the consumption of alcohol. 3)The blood alcohol level at the time of the breath test did not show impairment. The officer testified that he had been driving a truck that swerved into the left-hand side of the road more than four or five times. He testified that his motor skills were getting slower and he had a very bad slurred speech.
d_2012nsca52.txt,",  motions granted. Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so. While a dismissal of the criminal appeal is a serious remedy, since it means it will never be heard on its merits, the appellant has made it clear that she cannot provide certified transcripts unless the court orders the respondents to pay. The court has already declined to do so. There is no suggestion a further extension of time will result in the appellant perfecting the appeal.","The appellant appealed the June 29, 2011 decision of the Criminal Appeal Court dismissing her two appeals and ordering the respondents to pay the cost of certifying the 1,700 pages of transcript she had prepared for her appeal. At the time of the appeal, the appellant had filed a notice of appeal in the Provincial Court naming only Her Majesty the Queen and Judge Stroud as respondents and requesting that they pay the costs of certification of the transcript; in the meantime, she had filed notice of her intention to dismiss both appeals on the basis that they were the same matter and that she had committed the act of public mischief in which she had been convicted in June, 2009 when she reported an offence of assault with weapon to an RCMP officer, causing him to enter into an investigation, when the alleged offence had not been committed and she was not criminally responsible with respect to this charge. In addition, less than 100 of the pages are required to be included in the appeal books; in addition, there is no authority under the Rules for the respondents' motions to order the court to order transcripts for the appellant; R. v. MacDonald, 2003 NSCA 27 (CanLII), para. 6; LeBrun v. Woodward, 2001 N.SCA 5. Dismissal Motions: 1) The appellant's motions to consolidate her 2 appeals and to have the respondents pay to certify the transcripts are granted. 2) The respondents' motion to dismiss her Criminal and Civil Appeals is granted. 3) Queen's Bench Rule 90.40(2) provides the court with an authority to order a party to pay for the production of transcripts for its own purposes. It is not necessary that respond to everything sought by the appellant in her motion given the decision to dismiss them. The respondents are representatives of the Crown and are thus responsible for the actions of the Province and theProvincial Court in continuing to conduct trials involving the appellant. Given that dismissal of her Criminal Appeal, the court is no closer to having the required materials filed and the appeal set down and heard by the applicant than it was six months ago. Given the appellant's personal circumstances, they delayed bringing their motions for dismissal until they felt there was no chance she would perfect her appeal on the same time."
e_2004skpc82.txt,"The accused youth is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions. However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.","The accused was charged that he did operate a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug, contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges.  1)The accused did not show any signs of impairment. His blood alcohol concentration was at or near.08. 2)His appearance was normal and his movements were slow and deliberate. 3)The Court concluded that in the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for these tests, the proper method of application and to comment on their relative reliability, it was not appropriate for the court to rely upon them on the issue of guilt or innocence to the prejudice of the accused. 4)The evidence of slurred speech was not found to support the accused's explanation for his erratic driving. 5)Although the accused had not shown any symptoms of impairment, his appearance was flushed with alcohol and the smell of alcohol was strong and it was reasonable to expect the accused to be moving slowly. The Court noted that the accused was driving a sports car at the time of the offence and noted that it had been slightly windy at that time. It was not unusual for him to speed to some extent on the highway as he passed the vehicle that he had just passed. He appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations in his communications with the peace officer and legal aid duty counsel. 6)It is not appropriate to rely on expert evidence in the assessment of evidence of alleged impairment. The tests must be thoroughly reviewed, thoroughly assessed and considered on the basis of the evidence. 7)There was no evidence of impairment beyond the reasonable doubt on the part of the Court. The accused had no problems with balance and was moving in a slow, deliberate manner. The lack of coordination and inability to perform physical tests was a reasonable ground of impairment for an offence of impaired driving. The evidence of non- impairment was found to be reasonable."
3_2003canlii64101.txt,"The mother moved for the dismissal of the pending permanent care trial, arguing that, applying the reasoning in a recent Court of Appeal decision, the court had lost jurisdiction. No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties. The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel. Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed. The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial. When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act. When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date.","The mother sought a dismissal of the motion under the Children and Family Services Act by which the court had lost its jurisdiction to hear the case because the trial was to commence tomorrow. The trial had been approaching the first disposition deadline under section 41(1) of the Act and the trial court had extended the deadline so that it could conduct the disposition hearing after that statutory deadline had passed. Counsel for the mother made a motion that based on the rule in B.F. I had lost my jurisdiction and must dismiss the matter. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)The time limit preceded the disposition order and, subsequent to the Court's ruling in October 2003 referred to as Nova Scotia (Minister of Community Service) v. BCFS, 2003 NSCA 119 (CanLII), which I will hereinafter refer to as BSF. 2)The court had not lost its jurisdictional jurisdiction in this matter and the matter was to continue tomorrow.  2)Reapprehension will expose the child to the very delay the deadlines are designed to avoid since each of the stages set out in the Act (interim hearing, protection finding and at least one disposition hearing) will have to run their course, in the absence of consent to consolidation under s40(2). 3)When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for a rushed trial date. There may be need for the preparation of expert reports and other trial preparation and to ascertain whether ongoing further services would have resolved the problem. The court has a fundamental policy of following those guidelines whenever it is possible and of taking whatever exceptional steps are needed to achieve that compliance. 4)Any attempt after the trial to make a continued intervention order of any type would not be possible in the circumstances."
7_2011nspc27.txt,"The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery. A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","The accused, a young person, was taken into custody after police stopped a car suspected of being involved in a robbery with a firearm at a specific address in Sackville. The police stopped the car and found a gun, a gun and brass knuckles. The accused pleaded guilty to the robbery and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The gun was found under the seat of the car, loaded; the accused was not asked about what had taken place during the robbery or who had been there when it happened; and the accused had nothing to do with the robbery. HELD: The accused was found in the car with the gun and the stolen property, in the company of three young men. The circumstantial evidence at this point is that the accused, who was sitting in the driver's seat with the guns drawn, was not the person who was in the vehicle at the time of the stop. It is entirely logical to infer that the people found in that car when it was stopped by the police were the people who got in the back seat when it left Sackville, and that the driver of the other car picked up the accused and drove him to the address where he was picked up. The Crown has proven that it has a reasonable doubt that this person was involved in the robbery of the accused. The circumstances in this case are more than suspicious. The hand gun was not present in the Car and the car was stopped on Northwest Arm Drive. The car was observed picking up people in the area and then picking them up in Fairview. The evidence that the person in the second car (the accused) was not in the courtroom when the police stopped it also raises a question of whether the Crown should have proven that the crime was committed in the context of the crime committed. It was also raised that the Crown had a reasonable chance of establishing that this individual was not involved with the offence committed."
7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The court upheld the sentence of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge for the offence of unlawfully trafficking in forest products. The court found that, after considering all of the evidence, it was not satisfied that during the period in the indictment, the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the actus reus on Count No.1 of unlawfully harvesting forest products, nor Count 2 of unlawfully possessing forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The Crown appealed the sentence imposed on the basis of the illegal sale of 211 cords of firewood consisting of 150 truckloads, 58 truckloads and three cords sold to Clarke. The defendant argued that he harvested the wood from Crown lands and not on Crown lands. The evidence presented by conservation officers was uncontradicted. The defence argued that the defendant sold the wood to an undercover officer for his personal heating and firewood business and that since the trial judge acquitted him of related charges of unlawfully extracting forest products and unlawfully possessing wood, it logically follows that he should not have been convicted of unlawful trafficking in such wood. HELD: 1)The court held that the Crown was not entitled to take this as an admission that the wood he sold was from Crown land and that it was unlawfully trafficked. 2)The defendant was entitled to have his conviction quashed. 3)The Court of Appeal would not interfere with a sentence imposed under s. 822 of the Criminal Code. The standard of review applied by an appellate court hearing summary conviction appeal is a narrow one. An appellate court ought not interfere in the decision of a trial judge in the absence of palpable and overriding error in law. The trial judge is to be given proper deference on matters of credibility since the appellant judge has the opportunity to see and hear witnesses. 4)The sentence imposed was an unreasonably low penalty for an offence the evidence established. The Court of Queen's Bench ordered the execution of the sentence on each count."
8_2017skqb249.txt,"HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel had constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The dispute concerned the exclusive right of the respondent to market, licence and distribute HAL's products in Canada. The respondent wanted to have the sole right to market and distribute the products through its subsidiary. The IDSL, as amended by the MIDSL, did not impose an obligation on the respondent that it purchase a set number of licences from HAL. Accordingly, the application for leave was dismissed. HELD: The application was dispositive. The issues upon which HAL seeks leave to appealed were questions of mixed fact and law, not pure questions of law. A term permitting an appeal from the arbitrators' decision on an error of law simply does not fall into the category of the obvious or something that goes without saying in the factual matrix of this case. Such an implied term is not akin, for instance, to the implied term of good faith in contractual negotiation or the implied terms of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment. HOLD: The terms of the agreement, although not specifically referring to a right of appeal on an application, contain an implied condition that permits the parties to appeal arbitrators’ decisions, with leave, on the basis of errors in law. The intention expressed in the arbitration clauses of the agreements was clear and clearly stated. The parties clearly intended to give the plaintiff a fair chance to make reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that any subsequent transition following the termination of the contract was effectively concluded with minimal disruption. 1)Leave to appeal under s. 45(2) of the Act is not an option in this case because HAL did not explicitly 'contracted out' of any right to appeal decisions of the Arbitration Panel. The provisions of this agreement exclude the right of such an appeal on questions of Law, pursuant to s.45(2). 2)HAL cannot appeal the arbitrator’s decision, and the application must be dismissed. The questions that the respondent proposes to raise on appeal are questions of mix law and fact, rather than questions of fact, and even if they are questions, they are not of sufficient importance to compel the Court to grant leave under s45(3). HELD : 1)The application was disposed of. Even if the court had been different, it would still not have granted leave.  2)The agreements were not intended to be binding. 3)The terms of this contract set out very clear and well"
5_2006nssc43.txt,"The plaintiff alleged that a small piece of metal seen dangling from beneath the defendant's tractor trailer flew out from under the trailer as it passed the plaintiff's vehicle and hit her engine hood, bounced in the open window and caused her to lose control of her vehicle. She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control. The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled. Application for summary judgment granted; the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success. The plaintiff cannot resist a summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff's credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge.","The plaintiff was driving from Halifax to Seabright when she was hit by a tractor-trailer. She alleged that when the defendant passed her vehicle, a piece of metal fell off of his vehicle, fell to the pavement, bounced on to the engine bonnet and hit the windshield of her vehicle. The plaintiff claims damages for injuries to her arms, shoulders and neck. The defendant engaged two experts who examined the piece of Metal and reported that the piece did not come from the tractor- trailer. The experts concluded that the metal did not belong to the trailer and that upon inspection there was no place for it to dangle. Defendant's application was adjourned to allow the plaintiff to secure their own expert report although none was filed prior to this proceeding. The expert reports filed by the defendant remain uncontradicted. The claim for damages for injury to the plaintiff's eyes, shoulders, neck and hearing loss was dismissed."

The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor. The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.,"The accused was charged with offences contrary to s. 271(1) and s. 153 of the Criminal Code. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused touched her vagina and breasts numerous times over top of her clothing, in all cases touching her inappropriately, while she was sleeping or in the presence of her children. The accused was drunk and had been inebriated. The complainant alleged that he touched her buttocks once, her breasts once and sometimes while standing on the couch. She called the police. An expert witness testified that he had been drinking and that he was drunk. HELD: Accused found guilty. 1)There was no reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Although he did not have a reasonable chance of being found guilty on all of the allegations, there was some circumstantial evidence surrounding his guilty plea. There was no evidence beyond that which would have confirmed his guilt. 2)The evidence was not so reasonable as to justify a guilty verdict. The Crown had all the evidence they needed to convict the accused of dangerous behaviour. The Court was unable to conclude that his explanation for his behaviour was beyond reasonable doubt and beyond the reasonable doubt of his reasonable doubt on all the other allegations."

He appealed the dismissal of his application in March 2000 to vary the support order by suspending payment until he gained employment and by reducing arrears. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part.

HELD: Application for leave to appeal is denied orally. In any application to add a party as a defendant, the Court must first decide whether there is a prima facie and meritorious claim disclosed in the amending pleading. The onus lies on the plaintiffs to establish on the balance of probabilities that they have a reasonable possibility of establishing a claim against the party they seek to add.

2_2011nssc486.txt,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","This was a divorce proceeding and the parties were in a shared parenting regime. The mother sought custody and primary care of the children, while the father was a regular user of marijuana and alcohol. The father was to pay a proportionally greater share of the day to day care expenses, which created a permanent breakdown of the marriage. The parties had lived and they continued to live separate and apart from one another for a period in excess of 1 year. HELD: 1) The evidence provided by the father and his witnesses differed materially from that given by the mother and her witnesses. 2) The Court found that the information provided was credible. The information was based on the actual income for 2010 and extrapolated for 2011 and 2012. 3) The information from the Mother was credible as well. 4) The children were to be in the joint custody of the Father and the mother. 5) The statements of the parties' mutual friends and relatives were not to be relied upon. The Court could not rely on the motives of the witnesses. 6) There was no presumption in favour of reducing the child support obligation downward from the Guidelines amount under s9. The Child Support Guidelines as interpreted by the Supreme Court of Canada are interpreted to mean that the child must be put in the best interests of his or her parents. The child support table was to come into effect January 1, 2012."
5_2011nsca46.txt,"The defendant, who was found guilty of the careless use of a firearm, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace and possession of a restricted or prohibited firearm applied for bail pending appeal. He had been found, in his residence, with a firearm licensed in Alberta but not licensed to be brought into this province or possessed here. The defendant had residences in both Alberta and Nova Scotia but his Halifax residence was now up for sale and he travelled extensively around the world for his work. Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction. Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions. The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","The appellant was convicted of seven offences relating to careless use of a firearm and possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public. He contended the trial judge erred in failing to find a breach of the Charter when the police entered the appellant’s condominium and failed to grant remedy as a result. He also contended the minimum sentence provisions of s. 95(1) were unconstitutional. He submitted his s. 86(1)(88(1), 88(1)) and 95(2) offences were dropped because the appellant had complied with his recognizance and the terms of his release were inadequate. The appellant submitted that he had no criminal record, substantial assets, a favourable pre-sentence report and a favourable passport. He alleged the trial court erred by failing to consider the fact that the appellant was a flight risk. HELD: The appellant was released on terms set out in R. v. Renacci (1993), 86 C.C.C.; 86 NSCA 10 at 48. The Crown opposes the appellant's release primarily on the basis that he is flight risk; that he has not established that he will surrender himself into custody as required by s. 679(3)(b) of the Code and that his detention is not necessary in the public interest. The grounds of appeal are weak and must be balanced in the interest of public safety. The fact that he was found guilty on four of the offences and was sentenced to a minimum sentence of three years for the offences, and that the circumstances he had been convicted of had nothing to do with the charges he had faced or the convictions that have resulted, but rather his professional obligations which had not resulted in a reduction in sentence."
4_2011nssc71.txt,"The judge declared the defendants could pay legal fees from third party loans without offending two prior execution orders that prevented them from disposing of any property. The declaration was explicitly made on the assumption that the loans would not be secured against the defendants' existing assets. Later, the defendants' counsel wrote to the court essentially indicating he could not confirm the loans would not be secured against any assets. The court issued this supplemental decision. In the absence of any evidence the loans will not be secured against assets already subject to the execution order, or will not otherwise reduce those assets, the order and declaration sought can no longer be granted.","The defendants sought an order confirming their ability to pay certain amounts for billed and unbilled time without violating the terms of two execution orders previously issued against them, as Hfx No. 190408 against the judgment debtors to the plaintiff and the defendants, who were successful litigants in this action. HELD: The Court was unable to grant the proposed order that accompanied the notice in the matter. It was not the Court's intention in the submissions to expand on the evidence in Ms. Cochrane's affidavit. The affidavit evidence did not reveal where the loans come from or if they will reduce the exigent assets of the defendants."
b_1999canlii13927.txt,"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the Court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial in the trial proper and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so, and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The Court held that it was in the interest of conducting an orderly trial that it would be appropriate to have the accused's evidence put on the record at the outset of the trial. All issues of notice to the Crown and sufficiency of disclosure can be sorted out at that time. This is a common sense proposition applicable to Charter applications to exclude evidence.  1)This can quite properly occur by the application of some or all of the evidence which is already before the court and on record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of that evidence can be reserved by the Court pending the determination of the Charter issue on its merits and the application for s.24 remedy, if any. 2)The accused is entitled to have his/her own witnesses as witnesses. However, it must be left to defence counsel to have these people to attend as witnesses if, in their assessment, the testimony of such witnesses is required in support of the application to exclude. There is no common sense principle applicable to applications to exclusion. In light of these observations and what has been said in the cases, one cannot see any justification for the procedure presently proposed."

Equal division ordered, to be paid in installments secured against the land. Husband ordered to pay maintenance for support of the children.","The parties entered into a decree dissolving the marriage in 1982. The wife commenced an action against the husband shortly after the action was commenced. The husband attended the trial without counsel. He was ordered to pay interim maintenance but withdrew almost a year before the trial commenced. HELD: 1)The evidence presented by the applicant was uncontested. No exceptions, exemptions or equitable considerations that would make equal distribution of matrimonial property unfair or inequitable were found. 2)The lis pendens registered as item 84-S-26535 were vacated. 3)The respondent was to pay maintenance of $250 for each child, continuing on the first day of each succeeding month for a total of 30 months. 4)The petitioner was to recover her costs of $500 and the respondent's additional sum of $512.50 to cover one-half of the cost of appraising the property. 5)In arrears the parties were to apply for an order of judicial sale of the land to satisfy payment of the remaining sum. 6)The father was to bear his share of the costs of maintaining his children."
4_2007skqb438.txt,"The parties have two children, a son born March 1990 and a daughter December 1991. A trial on the issues of the son's residence in 2006, the parties' income for the purposes of child support and any s. 7 expenses was held. HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son. This is a period of no more than 5 months. Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.  2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629. The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3) The parties have been divorced since 1998. The son has played baseball since 2004. The daughter has speed skated since 2001. The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father. It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years. The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription. The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%. Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5) Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794. His income is considerably higher now. His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","The respondent father applied to vary an order made in May 2002 for child support payable to the petitioner mother on behalf of his two youngest children, Michael, born March 15, 1990, and Jessica, born December 30, 1991. The parties divorced in 1998. The petitioner mother had the use of his father's vehicle because she was in Viet Nam. When she returned in August 2006, Michael began living with his mother. This ended in January or February 2007, which is a period of no more than 5 months. Michael resumed living with the mother and was supported by his grandmother. HELD: 1)The parties did not speak to one another, notwithstanding the difficulty it undoubtedly causes their children. 2)The onus is on the parent wishing to invoke the operation of s to demonstrate to the court's satisfaction that a shared custody arrangement as contemplated by s. is in place and has been in place over the course of year. While it is necessary that there be a shared parenting regime in place, it is not necessary that the parties live together for the foreseeable future. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9. Accordingly, the father did not meet it. 3)A trial of s. 7 would be necessary to determine the appropriate amount to be paid by the father each month to cover s. expenses. 4)The mother was entitled to costs in the amount of $500."
e_2011skqb244.txt,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","A summary conviction appeal from a judgment in September 2010, wherein the learned Provincial Court judge convicted the appellant of impaired care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit of.08 contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The grounds of appeal were: 1) the learned trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count in convicting the appellant; 2) the trial judge failed to use the evidence of the central Crown witness as exculpatory evidence; and 3) the appellant did not resort to conjecture or speculation as suggested by the appellant. The trial judge did not err in his treatment of the evidence."

At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment. It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her. In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal. Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.  2) The contract of employment was a term contract extending from May to August 31, 2004. The plaintiff was dismissed on July 12.

The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company. The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action. The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","The appellants sought an order permitting the defendant to withdraw his admissions and add a claim for an 'oppression remedy' pursuant to s. 5.03 of the Companies Act and leave for the defendant's counsel to commence a derivative action.

The new counsel sought to amend the admissions to include a claim under s. 7(5)(b) of the Act for alleged misdeeds of the plaintiff's former director and officer. The defendants argued that the judge erred in using the less restrictive test in the Act. The judge allowed the admission to be withdrawn because there was a triable issue between the applicant's rights as a shareholder and those of a former shareholder and the plaintiff’s right to share in the corporation. The dissenting counsel requested leave to commence the derivative action on behalf of the defendant and sought to attach a new statutorily mandated term for good faith and fidelity to the company to which the plaintiff had been entitled. The plaintiff appealed the order. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no evidence on which the defendant erred. The applicant had admitted that he had lost his share of the vote in a shareholder meeting and that he was no longer a shareholder.

The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child. The mother was against this plan. The biological father only reappeared on the scene after the child was taken into care and acknowledged that the child did not know him as her father. Child placed in the permanent care of the Agency with no access to the mother or the psychological father; access ordered to the biological father for a period of six months at which time the access order will expire automatically unless an application to vary is made; the Agency is to arrange for a parental capacity assessment of the biological father. The child continued to be at substantial risk of physical harm due to neglect if she was returned to the mother's care and the child would be at risk of exposure to violence if returned to the psychological father's care due to the tumultuous relationship between the mother and him. Although some improvements had recently been made in the mother's life, she had a history of frequent changes of residence and did not appear able put the child's needs ahead of her own. The Agency had not had an opportunity to assess the appropriateness of a placement with the biological father.","The agency applied for an order of permanent care and custody with no provision for access to the child. The mother opposed the application and requested an order returning the child to her care. The biological father who had minimal contact with the child was added as a party to the order. The Agency alleged that the child had been in the care of the Agency for more than three years and that there had been a substantial risk of physical harm caused by the mother and psychological father's failure to supervise the child and that the risk of her safety had not gone away. The child had a long history of involvement with the Agency. The agency alleged that its child was at risk of harm because of instability in the home, its repeated moves and its repeated incidents of violence. The respondent mother alleged that her daughter had been touched inappropriately by her father and that her relationship with him had changed. The Respondents denied any involvement with her daughter and suggested that counselling be ordered with the mother's assistance. The father's application for standing was granted on September 15, 2005. HELD: The burden of proof in proceeding such as this was clearly on the Agency as it had regard to the seriousness of the consequences of the decision and the agency's claim that the agency had failed to protect the child due to its failure to conduct proper child protection and supervision. There was no evidence that the Respondents had obstructed the child's path to freedom or that they had failed in any meaningful way in order to protect their child. No evidence was obtained as a result of the application nor of any subsequent subsequent access by the Respondent or any other agency. The only evidence was that the respondent mother and her daughter were unable to contact each other and there was a risk that the biological father would harm the child if he were to contact her and the mother would suffer harm if he did not have access to her daughter. There were no credible allegations of domestic or sexual abuse against the respondent parents and the evidence did not support the respondent father's allegations. The court ordered the respondent to attend and complete anger management counselling. Counsel for the Agency was not able to represent either party. The applicant was granted standing on the basis that she failed to comply with certain conditions of the protection order."
e_2004nspc8.txt,"The defendant applied for a stay of proceedings on the basis of a violation of his right to be tried in a reasonable time. There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial. Stay of proceedings granted. At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.","This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter. The accused was charged with exceeding the Breathalyzer and impaired driving. He was arraigned on the information and requested the first available date for trial. The Defense had verballyized an intention to raise s. 8 and s.9 Charter motions and lead evidence. The Crown objected and the accused waived his right to a trial. HELD: The application was stayed.  1)The length of the delay was well outside the 8-10 month guideline established in Morin. 2)The applicant asserted his right of a speedy trial by requesting the first trial date. He retained counsel and was prepared to fight the merits of the case at trial. 3)Prejudice to the accused may be inferred. The length of delay is likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered given the passage of time. 4)There is no evidence that institutional delay of 13 months is the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges and the technical nature of Breathalyzers, the fact that the Defense has verbalized an intent to raise S. 8, s. 9 and S. 9 motions and the presence of a motion in the legislature can be inferred from the length of this delay. 5)The longer the delay the greater the risk that the evidence given by witnesses may not be as reliable as it might otherwise be, due to fading memories.  6)The court was asked to infer prejudice on the basis that the lengthof the delay may interfere with quality of the evidence tendering given the time that has occurred since the charges were filed."
7_2010nsca95.txt,"The first defendant was the lessee and driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the plaintiff. The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the plaintiff. The Chambers judge found that there was no real chance of success on the arguments advanced. The lease agreement had none of the characteristics of a rental agreement as contemplated by s. 62 of the Motor Vehicle Act and the statements made by the parties respecting their claim for compensation in the event of a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff's claim against the respondent was that the lease agreement was vicarious and that Chrysler was not. The insurer appealed. Allowing the appeal, that the Chambers judge erred in finding that s. 248 has no application on the facts of this case. The reverse onus provision does not apply. When a person living in a vehicle without a driver makes an effort to rent it, the owner must demonstrate that the use of the vehicle is for a reasonable purpose and that the rental agreement does not fit within the type of rental agreement contemplated by Motor Vehicle 62. The automobile dealer had none the characteristics considered in Bazley and the law that has developed since that case was decided concludes that the general concept of 'ownership' has not been sufficiently advanced to warrant an application on this part of the law."
e_2004skqb388.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code; assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Code; dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Code; and two counts of assault contrary to s. 266(a) of the Code. HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict. 2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant. The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered. The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct. The offence of dangerous driving was established and the accused was found guilty. 4) The accused was found guilty of two counts of assault.",The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and with aggravated assault contrary to ss. 249(1)(a). The accused was found guilty of driving a motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public contrary to S. 249 of the Code. HELD: The Crown must prove both the mens rea and actus reus. The criminality of the misconduct lies mainly in the intention of the accused. The Crown cannot convict on suspicion and I am left with a reasonable doubt about the intention. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct. The evidence that the accused assaulted the complainant and that he got more aggressive and kicked her in the face is overwhelming. The Court found the accused guilty of both counts.

The School Board breached its general duty to act fairly in allowing a Board member to vote when he had not attended the public meetings on the issue.

The school system has determined that the declining use of classroom space is costly with respect to the maintenance expense of schools.

9_2013skca85.txt,"The respondent mother applied to lift the stay of execution imposed by Court of Appeal Rule 15(1) when the appellant father appealed the trial judge's decision to award custody of the parties' son to the mother with the child to have access to the father for one extended weekend per month during the school year (see: 2013 SKQB 212). The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother. HELD: The Court granted the application. There would be no harm to the child if the stay was lifted. The father was directed to perfect his appeal and the stay of proceedings arising from Court of Appeal Rule 15(4) was also lifted.","The applicant mother sought a lifting of the stay of execution on the judgment of the trial judge (indexed as 2013 SKQB 212 (CanLII)) which was automatically imposed upon the father's appeal from that decision. HELD: The application was granted and the stay was lifted in accordance with the factors set out in s. 8(a)(i) of the Children's Law Act.  1) The court found no harm to the child or any significant disruption in his life if the stay were lifted. The child was to have his access time with his father for the remainder of August, in compliance with the terms of the court's decision. The mother acknowledged this to be the case. 2) The fact that the child was essentially abandoned by both his parents from the time he was a toddler until he was 10 years old, both of his parents abdicated their parental responsibilities in favour of his grandmother. The father had not bothered to have any involvement with the child from the early years until 2010. Even after that he did not maintain any contact until the mother again contacted him to come and take the child to Moose Jaw in June 2011. 3) There were two important factors which led the court to the conclusion that it would be in the child's best interests to lift the stay: access and accessibility. It was not possible to conclude that Mackenzie could be bonded or attached to either of his parent in any meaningful way. From the time that the toddler was essentially discarded by both parents until he were 10 or 11 years old. Both of his grandparents abdicate their parental responsibility in favour the grandmother. It is imperative that the son be provided the opportunity to have regular and consistent contact with his parents. The incentive on the father to perfect his appeal, should he still wish to do so, was put on him. The court lifted the stay in the cause."

Under the existing order the children's primary residence was with their Father. A custody investigation conducted in 1990 when the mother had first commenced this application had recommended that the existing arrangement be continued. The Father now intended, however, to move with the children to Ontario to take additional education. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Judge found that the move to Ontario was a sufficient change of circumstances to permit a variation application to proceed. She therefore proceeded to consider if the move was in the best interests of the children. 2)The Judge reviewed recent authorities from across Canada dealing with whether a custodial parent should be permitted to move with the children. 3)In the circumstances of this case the Judge was convinced that the move was reasonable and was not motivated by any desire on the part of the Father to thwart the Mother's access.","An application for variation of the January 1990 judgment, which gave judgment for divorce and joint custody to the parents of two boys born April 22, 1984 and June 3, 1986. The mother had moved from Ontario to British Columbia, where she now resided with her new husband. The father had recently obtained a divorce order and was seeking to move out of the province with the boys. The parties had entered into a separation agreement in 1988 which provided for joint custody, residence with the father and generous access to the mother. The petitioner mother had always been the primary care giver of the children and had the primary residence in the father's home. She moved to Ontario in 1990 to take part in a dental college course.

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The petitioner mother's move was motivated by a desire to frustrate access and was not unreasonable.  2)The father was granted generous access. 3)The Court noted that most divorces are found to have a material and significant change in circumstances. 4)Once the parties have established a pattern of living in harmony with one another, the pattern continues. 5)The law permits variation of custody if the reasons for the move are the same as the reasons set out in the divorce judgment.  6)The fact that the father had, together with his present wife, the day to day care of the four children from their early years onward, except when they were exercising the access parent.

e_2013skca1.txt,"The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","Rule 173(c) of The Class Actions Act requires leave to appeal from a Chambers judge's certification order and his dismissal of their Rule 173(C) application. The proposed appellants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act and Rule 49 of the Court of Court of Appeals Rules for an order granting them leave to appealed from the chambers judge's certification order and the dismissal of the Rule173(c). They argued that the Chambers judge erred in law in failing to apply the Anns test, which states that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those akin to those before him. They also argued that evidence of clients involved in the mining industry using legal opinions provided by their legal counsel as a marketing tool is so commonly known among tax lawyers that McMillan should have been alive to the practice and should have taken appropriate steps to guard against their opinion letters being inappropriately used for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with the client or clients. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents in any event of the cause.  1)Nothing in the Chamber judge's reasons suggested he applied the Ann's test or applied the Re: Collections Inc. v. Saskatchewan, 2002 SKCA 119 and were well known to counsel. 2)The Chambers judge made no errors in law. The facts, coupled with case law stating a lawyer might owe a fee of service to a client and the evidence of the Respondent lawyer, Gary Davies, establish a common issue that appears to meet the commonality requirements of the class actions Act.  3)The issues raised by the applicants were not the only issues to be considered in the application. 4)The common issue was not one of relevance to the trial or to the cause but rather a commonality issue.  5)No appeal was granted for breach of s. 6(1)(c) or s. 7(d) of the Act. 6)Leave was granted or withheld in consideration of merit and importance as follows: 1)The proposed appeal would be prima facie destined to fail and not of sufficient merit to warrant the attention of this Court.  6)The Court of appeal would not require an analysis by the Province of the common law or the interpretation of applicable law in the circumstances. 7)The arguments advanced by the parties in their submissions were not of relevance in the context of the case law or to any of the other issues before the Court. 8)The facts, combined with"

She raised s.9 and 8 of the Charter in objecting to the arrest and seizure of the duffel bag. The voir dire occupied 5 days. HELD: 1)The four requirements set out in R. v. Feeney for a warrantless search were satisfied. The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the duffel bag was incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. 2)The accused had no expectation of privacy with respect to either her friend's residence or the bag. The decision in R. v. Edwards was squarely on point. There was no evidence tying the accused to the gym bag. It was of a different description than the one used in the drugstore robbery. The accused never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it. The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence. 3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter. To exclude the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused objected to her arrest and to the seizure of a duffel bag containing a quantity of narcotics. The police conducted a voir dire as result of the opening of the trial. A great deal of evidence was presented, the majority of which was elicited in very detailed and extended cross-examination. The accused also called evidence on the voir de dire but did not testify. HELD: The arrest was lawful. The seizure of the bag was incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful.  1)The Court found the accused was arrested lawfully and the search was conducted reasonably. 2)The restriction that the search must be 'truly incidental to [the arrest] means that the police must be attempting to achieve some valid purpose connected to that arrest. Whether such an objective exists will depend on what the Crown were looking for and why. 3)The bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence which must be considered in light of the suggestion that the evidence should be excluded under s.24(2) of the Charter. If there were any violations of the accused's rights under the Charter, the accused had no expectation of privacy in this case either as to the residence or the bag. 4)The search of the house and seizure were incidental and therefore not unlawful. The actions of the police were not unlawful in respect to either the arrest or search and seizure. 5)The bags constituted a non-consecutive evidence and should not be presumed innocent until proven otherwise.  6)The court concluded that the accused must have reasonable and probable grounds on which to base the arrest. If the Crown is relying for authorization is the common law doctrine of search incident to arrest, then the limits of that doctrine must be respected. The Court held that if there are any violations under the charter, they were of a minor nature and certainly not sufficiently egregious to engage the provisions of s. 24(2)."

It is uncontroverted that Brina has disabilities that necessitate certain tools such as a computer for her to be successful in her post-secondary training. HELD: 1) The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses and there shall be an order accordingly. 2) The September 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in Brina's s. 7 expenses. Accordingly the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s. 7 costs. 2) The crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred on Brina's part and will assist her with her future plans. 3) The Zeller's supplies would normally be covered under the Table support and that expense is disallowed. 4) Brina's s. 7 post-secondary expenses are $7,123.72 and include tuition, crisis prevention class and books, required university books, bus pass, black cartridge for the printer, Shaw internet, Microsoft licence, computer repairs and updated virus protection.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to have arrears fixed with regard to s. expenses related to her daughter's post-secondary education and in addition requests that the amount of the ongoing s. 7 expenses be specified.

In addition to ongoing support for the parties' oldest child, Corry, in addition to other ongoing support and payment of s.8 expenses, the petitioner claimed for 2003/2004 s.6 expenses. The petitioner also requests the amount to be fixed for ongoing s7 expenses.  2) In September 2005, Justice R. S. Smith terminated the respondent's obligation to pay support for Corry and Corry's oldest child and ordered the respondent to pay 66% of the s.&7 post-primary education expenses. In October 2005, the Justice D. Dickson terminated the petitioner's obligation for child support purposes, finding that Corry had not paid support for his oldest child in the fall and spring terms and that the two youngest children, both born prior to October 1, 1981, and in the spring terms, orthodontic work and costs associated with Brina's post education. The respondent objects to some of the computer repairs and equipment. He also objects to the crisis prevention class. 3) The petitioner's s.-7 post degree education expenses for the 2005/2006 year are calculated using the university fall, spring and fall terms. The costs relating to the computer are legitimate s7 costs. The student loans were covered by Table support.

Therefore, the student loans and computer repairs were legitimate s.(7)7 costs and were within the range of what the respondent is responsible for. The University of Regina books, books, equipment and costs were legitimate expenses. 6) The appellant accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of these expenses."

Application dismissed; there was sufficient evidence to constitute reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrant. Overall the nature of the evidence was compelling with four separate and independent sources all confirming either that the defendant was selling drugs or that drugs were being sold at his residence; although individually none of the sources was of known or proven reliability, collectively they reinforced and confirmed each other; and the police conducted surveillance which corroborated the information provided by the sources.","The defendant made an application for the exclusion of evidence found following a search conducted at his residence pursuant to a warrant issued by fax from the Justice of the Peace Centre in Dartmouth, N.S. The defendant argued that the information to obtain the warrant did not meet the test in R. v.

HELD: The evidence was compelling and the application was granted. There was sufficient reliable evidence to constitute the reasonable and probable grounds for issuance of the warrant. There were at least three concerns to be addressed in weighing evidence relied on by the police to justify a warrantless search. 1)The existence of fraud, non-disclosure, misleading evidence and new evidence were all relevant. However, rather than being a separate test, the test must be set out to determine whether there was enough reliable evidence that might reasonably have been believed by the Justice on which the warrant could have been issued. 2)There was sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the defendant was selling drugs or that drugs were being sold or used at his apartment, and four separate and independent sources were examined to confirm the validity of the information. 3)The evidence met the standard of reasonableness, which is the test for a review of the issuance of a warrant and the standard for conducting rehearing for the application. The review judge does not stand in the same place and function as the authorizing judge. He or she does not conduct rehearing of the application [page 1017]. This is the starting place for any reviewing judge."
1995canlii4337.txt,"This was an appeal from the decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board allowing an appeal from the decision of the Victims' Services Division denying compensation to the respondent on the basis the police had not proceeded with criminal charges for an assault which had occurred. Dismissing the appeal, that the Board had correctly interpreted its jurisdiction and made findings amply supported by the evidence arising from the de novo hearing. Failure of the police to lay a charge against the attacker did not disqualify the applicant from compensation if it was otherwise supported by the evidence.","The appellant appealed a decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board concerning an award of compensation pursuant to the Victims' Rights and Services Act. He alleged that the police had not brought criminal charges and that because the program was unable to confirm through the criminal justice system that you were a victim of a crime, we were unable to make a compensation award. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the Board correctly interpreted its jurisdiction, misinterpreted the relevant law and made findings of fact that were within its jurisdiction. There was ample evidence arising from the de novo hearing to support its findings."
c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accused’s father and his stepmother had been arrested for possession of firearms and ammunition. The Crown had obtained a Part VI Criminal Code authorization to intercept the private communications of named targets believed to be involved in the drug trade and the accused had admitted to having constructive and/or joint possession of the firearms. At issue was the issue of whether the accused should be charged with possession of a loaded prohibited firearm, a sawed off shotgun, a Lakefield Mark II rifle and ammunition, in a careless manner, or joint possession with the accused. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court found that the accused could not assert a privacy interest in order to obtain the protection of s8 of the Charter and then, when that application went badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. 1) The accused had not obtained a Firearms Acquisition Certificate or any other kind of license for possessing firearms nor had he obtained a valid registration certificate for the firearms seized. 2) The essential issue on the firearms possession charges was whether the evidence led by the Crown had established that the respondent had constructive possession of two guns and ammunition at the address of his father. 3) The evidence introduced as evidence by the defence in relation to the guns was not the ones located in the respondent’d home. The evidence was that of the Crown witnesses. The witnesses did not cross-examine the lead exhibit officer for Operation Intrude. 4) The testimony of the accused and the documentary exhibits entered through or referred to by them left no doubt about the continuity and integrity of the exhibits. The burden of proof rests on the prosecution throughout the case and never shifts to the accused, and an assessment that an accused is probably guilty is insufficient. Reasonable doubt is the whole of the evidence that must be assessed in the determination of the facts and evidence of the case. 5) The Court was unable to accept that the guilty pleas of the respondent and the stepmother were relevant because they did not associate him with the phone and entitles him at trial to demand the Crown prove the phone is his."
6_2014skqb59.txt,"Family Law – Spousal Support – RetroactiveThe petitioner commenced a family law proceeding requesting divorce and equal division of family property in 2010. She did not seek spousal support as part of her original application to the Court. In August of 2013, the petitioner sought to amend her petition to include a claim for spousal support based on the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. In January of 2014, the petitioner filed an application for interim spousal support retroactive to the date of separation. HELD: The petitioner was awarded spousal support, but the award was not retroactive to the date of separation. The petitioner was entitled to spousal support from the date that she put the respondent on notice of her application for spousal support. The respondent, at age 61, should not be forced to work overtime in order to meet his spousal support obligations. The Court found there was economic disparity between the income of the petitioner and the income of the respondent and awarded an interim award of non-compensatory spousal support in the amount of $400 per month, retroactive to November 1, 2013, until further order of the Court.","FIAT: Following the provisions of the Divorce Act for awards of spousal support, the court considered the economic disparity between the respondent and petitioner's incomes that is $79,320.00 versus $56,103.00 for the respondent. Given the respondent's income and the petitioner's failure to take effective effective notice that she was seeking spousAL support, this Court held that retroactive spousals should be left to final adjudication and not be granted upon an interim application for child support. HELD: 1)Following the provisions in the D.B.S. v. Bracklow, 1999 CanLII 715, the Supreme Court of Canada adopts and summarizes the S.R.G. decision and summarizes Dram v. Foster 2009 MBCA 125 (CanLII), [1999] 1 SCC), 1 S.C.R., 420 D.L.R.; and [2006] SCC in the decision Malinowski v. Maline, [1999], 169 D.M.R.(4th) 577. 2) The court considered that the economic situation between the petitioner and the respondent, that is, $79 million, versus $57,103,00, is sufficiently disparate and upon which an interim award of non-compensatory spousary spousery support is appropriate. Given that the respondent is 61 years old and given his state of health, this court will not compel the respondent to work more than a 40 hour work week by attributing to him an income which is based upon significant overtime. The respondent earns rental income from leasing farm land. The net rental income yields $8,000. Given his income, the respondent can claim spousa support from the date of separation. 3) The petitioner is entitled to costs fixed at $1,200."

The respondent contested that the petition for divorce was a nullity and Saskatchewan courts did not have jurisdiction to hear the divorce proceedings and lacked jurisdiction or ought to decline to exercise jurisdiction under the Children's Law Act. Both parties made serious allegations against the other and there was substantial conflict in the affidavit evidence. HELD: An order for interim custody was granted on the condition the petitioner continued to reside with his parents in Regina and that the child not be removed from Regina without further court order. 1)The respondent did not acquiesce to the child's residing in Saskatchewan such that it may be said he was habitually resident here for the purposes of the Children's Law Act.  2)The seven factors listed in s15(1)(b) are conjunctive and the petitioner must satisfy them all. With respect to (iii) a petition for divorce was commenced in July 1996. 3)The child had a real and substantial connection with Saskatchewan and it was appropriate to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to s15(1)(b). Jurisdiction existed pursuant to s15(3) as the child had a closer connection to Saskatchewan then to Alberta. Both sets of grandparents and other family members on both sides reside in Saskatchewan. The child had no connection of consequence to the Province of Alberta.,FIAT. The petitioner sought interim custody of his son born in 1996. The Divorce Act requires either spouse to be ordinarily resident in the province for at least 1 year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. HELD: Interim custody was granted to the father with access to the petitioner's parents. 1)The mother argued that the father had consented to or acquiesced in the child residing in Saskatchewan. 2)The father had acquiesced to the change in residence and the child had no connection to Alberta. 3)The court had jurisdiction pursuant to s15(1)(b)as the childclearly had a closer connection to Saskatchewan than to Alberta and as a result of the child having no connection of consequence to Alberta the court could not find jurisdiction to exist pursuant to 15(3). 4)The child had a real and substantial connection with Saskatchewan and it was appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised in Saskatchewan as the child was the only child in the family who resided in the city.

After being involved in an accident, the accused was taken to hospital where a blood demand was given and eventually acceded to. The accused challenged the validity of the blood demand and argued that his right to counsel was violated. Accused guilty of operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit; there was no violation of the accused's right to counsel. The officer had valid grounds to make the demand, having been advised that the accused was in an accident, that someone had said the accused was either high or intoxicated, having smelled a mild odour of alcohol on the accused and the accused having advised him that he only had three beer. Even if the accused's claim to amnesia for all the events around that time was believed, there was no medical evidence to suggest that he could not understand what the officer said to him at the hospital. Although his degree of alertness may have fluctuated, he displayed an understanding of the situation by showing appropriate concern for how much he had been drinking and asking questions which showed an understanding of his situation and what speaking to counsel would entail.","The defendant was charged under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code with operating a motor vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit. He was also charged with impaired driving. Witnesses testified that the defendant lost control of his vehicle as he rounded a curve at the top of a hill near the fire Hall. The defendant was the lone occupant. Witnesses gave evidence of him getting gas at the fire hall, before leaving the scene. He claimed to have had three beers in the car, but later admitted to having only had three. He stated that he only consumed three beers at the time of the accident, and that he also informed someone that someone had let him know that he was either high or intoxicated. HELD: The accused was granted his s. 10(v) Charter rights at time when he was capable of appreciating and understanding the rights and gave an informed waiver as required by R. v. Clarkson.  1) The accused demonstrated an understanding of his situation through words and actions spanning a significant period of time.  2) His level of alertness may have been fluctuating, but he nevertheless displayed an appropriate concern for how much he had been drinking. 3) There was no evidence of mechanical defects or mechanical defects in the defendant's vehicle.

The Legal Profession Act, 1990 provides for an order for an inquiry into the conduct of members of the Law Society of Saskatchewan as they progress through criminal matters. The hearings were held intermittently, often by telephone conference calls, and the matter was adjourned from time to time. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent's jurisdiction was limited to the hearing of the complaint by virtue of the fact that the decision of the Hearing Committee was not provided to the chairperson within 45 days of the hearing. 2)The applicant had been working at establishing an international consulting business and had completed his undertaking to refrain from the practice of law prior to being granted an inactive membership. 3)Although stay of proceedings was ordered for the period from August 1989 until January 1990, it was incumbent upon the respondents to move without delay before the stay was granted and after it was lifted on the application of the respondents.

2011nssc455.txt,"The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The charges relate to events which occurred in April and April 2010 respectively. The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases. The first proposed basis is to separate for trial all of the so-called status offences but not the others. The second application is that severance would require three separate trials in all. HELD: The application for severance is dismissed on both the bases. 1) The accused adamantly disclaimed any association with the subject handgun whatsoever. He maintains that the gun was not his and that he had nothing to do with its possession or use either on April 8 or April 14th.  2) The facts are different but the interests of justice encompass the accused's right to be tried on the evidence admissible against him, as well as society's interest in seeing that justice is done in reasonably efficient and cost-effective manner. The obvious risk when counts are tried together is that the evidence in one count will influence the verdict on an unrelated count. 3) The evidence that the accused was in legal possession of the gun when it was found is indicative of his decision whether to testify on one or more of the counts. The only possible link conceded is the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession and control on both days. If found guilty of possession in relation to that date, certainly the evidence would be admissible. The court would be better served if the accused were found not guilty. 4) There is no evidence of a causal connection between the two events. It is impossible to draw inferences from either event. It would be unfair to require the Crown to prove the April 8th firearm possession charges first, which would ensure that the Crown evidence to be presented on the May 8th charges would be fair and legitimate. 5) The law on the application of severance was given shape to the broad criteria established in s. 591(3) and have identified factors that can be weighed when deciding whether to sever or not. The weighing exercise ensures that a reasonable balance is struck between the risk of prejudice to the accused and the public interest in a single trial and the benefits of having all the counts tried together but not having all of them tried in the same time slot.  6) The prospect of the accused having severance"

The deceased and applicant who had been living together purchased residential property in 1997. Their lawyer prepared a written agreement for the sellers and purchasers as well as the mortgage describing the purchasers as joint tenants. The sellers, unrepresented by legal counsel, prepared the transfer of the property and title issued without the words 'joint tenants'. The error describing the purchasers went unnoticed by their lawyer. The respondent had been married to the deceased when he died intestate in 1998. As the title stood an undivided one-half interest was owned by the estate and would devolve to the respondent pursuant to the Intestate Succession Act. HELD: The Land Titles Office Registrar was to amend the existing certificate of title by inserting 'joint tenants' after the names of the registered owners. 1)The requirements set out in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Rochon were satisfied. There was an obvious mistake which required rectification. The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did. 2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other.","FIAT.

The sellers were not represented by legal counsel. They prepared a transfer of the property and sent it to the Land Tittles Office for registration. On August 20, 1997, a mortgage was registered by the lawyer on August 21, 1997. The error describing the purchasers on the title went unnoticed by the registered owner. On the facts of this case there has been an obvious mistake which requires rectification. Damages in the circumstances are not a reasonably convenient remedy or procedure for giving relief. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent was entitled to an order directing the registrar to cancel the existing title and to issue new one in the names of the joint tenants. 2)The authorities had narrowly construed the discretion to amend or alter or cancel registrations under The Land Tles Act. The courts must be mindful of the integrity of the Torrens Land Titling System. The Court reviewed Bank of Nova Scotia v. Rochon and found that although there was an obvious error, it was not a reasonable remedy or standard procedure for providing relief. Damagedages in this case were not available.

Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history. There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down. The mother now sought the return of both children. The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect. Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation. Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency. Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately. The mother continued to require professional intervention.","The parties were involved in a rocky common law relationship between 1985 and 1995. They lived in Alberta and then Nova Scotia. At the conclusion of the relationship, L.M. became the custodial parent. The Agency sought to have its involvement terminated, while L.P. sought the termination of its involvement with the child K.B. who had run from her mother's home and stayed with her other sister. The mother, who had recently moved to Nova Scotia, alleged that the Agency had been aware of the children's protection history prior to the time the children were apprehended by the Agency. The children were placed in the supervised care of the Agency's common law partner, who was given permission to return to the province. During the appeal process, the Agency determined that the information concerning the children’s protection history was simply not germane to the decision made. The agency requested an ex parte order issued pursuant to the provisions of the Maintenance and Custody Act which prevented the children from leaving their home until further court hearing. The common law spouse, who lived with the children and had a child protection history, opposed the adoption of the two children. She argued that if the Agency knew about the protection history it would never have consented to the children moving to a new home with her sister. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the facts of the situation were not in dispute. There was insufficient evidence to justify the decision to terminate the protection relationship between the parties. There were significant gaps in the information provided to the court by the agency regarding the children. The appeal court ordered that the matter be heard by a grand jury in Nova Scotia on a full and complete basis. In addition, the court ordered an order pursuant to s. 39, s. 40 of the Children and Family Services Act to be heard in Alberta on October 18, 2006. The order was granted on an interim basis.

The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged that he committed a sexual assault on the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1) The complainant was employed as clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and although she testified that she knew the accused in 1999, it was much more likely that she met him in the spring of 2002 after he assumed his duties as Justice of the Peace in the same building. The Court found that the accused had not been detained and his right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been infringed. 2) The accused's evidence was examined. It was clear that the complainant had been sexually assaulted by the accused and that he had responded to her allegations by making comments about her appearance and his appearance. The evidence showed that the defendant believed that in light of the conversations that he and she had had prior to the charges, there was never any indication that she wasn't consenting to it. The accused believed that he was only joking, that there was nothing sexual about him, and that if she had asked him if he got lucky, he would have said 'oh, yeah'. The evidence clearly indicated that he pursued her to make a conversation, much of it sexual in nature. It is also clear that he did not encourage the conversation and that, in some cases, he did encourage her to engage in it. She was not certain that he would encourage her actions, but he encouraged her to participate in these conversations. She did not know that he offered to engage sexual conduct with her, but she said that he declined. She said that if he asked her if she got lucky he would tell her he would wait in his office. 3) The Court concluded that the statements of the accused can be considered in determining the credibility of a witness."

The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards. The applicant did not have any credit either. Their home had little, if any, equity. The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan. Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability.

The debt in effect can either be cancelled or affirmed. 2) Using the Superintendent's Standards he may have a monthly surplus of about $170.

The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse. At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages. They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.","The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their two boys. The mother, who had been the mother's counsellor, and the father, who were both medical professionals, claimed that the mother, his ex-wife and child and family counsellors had wrongfully accused them of physically and sexually abusing the children. HELD: The Court dismissed the application for variation. The Court held that the statements were made with express malice, which could not be proven by extrinsic or intrinsic evidence. The Substantial Damages to the Children were Inflammatory. They suffered loss of reputation, professional standing and marital discord. The co-defendants were negligent in the preparation of the reports."
e_2006skqb231.txt,"The plaintiff applies for certification pursuant to The Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight from the Dominican Republic to Regina. The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties. The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action. Corrigendum received dated July 20, 2006 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff applies for certification of this action pursuant to the Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight being held in Canada. The flight was delayed for about an hour and a half at the Punta Cana airport as a result of several evolving mechanical difficulties referred to by the pilot as 'creeping delay'. The defendants opposed the certification application on the basis that none of the five criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act had been met by the applicant. The plaintiff also submits that the airline and its employees did not take proper precautions to ensure that there were no excessive delays on board the plane. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's claim does not disclose a cause of action.  2) Pursuant to s. 4(2)(a), the Act provides for an order certifying an action as a class action is not a determination of the merits of the action. 3) The test to be applied in certification applications is similar to those used in applications to strike statement of claim as disclosing no action. All allegations of fact pleaded are to be accepted as true and secondly, pleadings will only be struck if it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs cannot succeed. 4) The generous approach to be adopted on this application is to set out the principles of class certification and the applicable statute and regulations. 5) Although the plaintiff was given until March 2006 to file case law with regard to the narrow issue of the meaning of 'bodily injury' within the Montreal Convention, it is not very high onus on the plaintiffs to satisfy the Court that the pleadings disclose cause of actions. Although the Court would have dismissed the certification request on the sole basis of not meeting the criteria as outlined in the Act, for reasons that will be thoroughly canvassed in this judgment, it would have also dismissed the certifying application on its basis of the other criteria as listed in the act not being met for reasons which will be briefly outlined in that judgment. 6) Corrigendum released July 20, 2006 and added to fulltext."
d_2007skqb266.txt,"FIAT: The primary issue is whether the father should pay for tutoring expenses. HELD: 1) The father is not opposed to Kody receiving some additional educational assistance. However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400.","FIAT: The Court ordered a number of orders regarding child support as well as an order regarding summer access. The remaining issues were: what, if any, should the father pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children? The mother proposed that Kody be registered in the Sylvan Learning Centre during the summer of 2007 due to his educational difficulties. Although it was clear from the evidence that the mother had an entitlement to interim spousal support, the father did not have the ability to pay. HELD: 1)The child support application was dismissed. 2)The childcare costs were necessary and reasonable. The school fees were included in the cost of the child care application. 3)The Sylvan learning centre expenses were reasonable. If the father paid this amount in addition to his s. child support amount, his total child support payment would be $1,315.00 per month. 4)The mother was required to bring this motion to obtain an appropriate sharing of s. expenses. 5)The father was ordered to pay costs in the sum of $400. 6)The Court directed s.15.3(1) of the Divorce Act to give priority to child support in determining child and spousAL support applications. In the matter before the Court, it was found that the father was unable to make a retroactive child support order because the father had not made reasonable child support payments as of February 2007.  7)Although the father has been voluntarily providing child support to the Mother, at least since February 2007, the mother was obliged to bring the motion to get an appropriate share of s.(e) expenses. The father was to pay the sum in the amount of $8,000 forthwith."
7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in these proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life Insurance claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the insurer whose lives were insured over the years under the Policy and whom it views as having paid the premiums resulting in the surplus. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be made. HELD: 1) The insurer has acted in full compliance with its duty of uberrima fides in bringing the potentially valid claims of the insured clients to the attention of the Court and in resisting the claim by Ag Credit that it would terminate on the failure to pay the premium on the basis of disability and for a refund of unearned premiums in the event of termination by the creditor. 2) The insurers have agreed that the surplus belongs to the clients. It is therefore in the interests of all of the clients that the funds actually remain in the hands of Empire Life with the potential of continuing to earn interest rather than be placed on deposit with the Court. Since no other person has a competing interest to the Ag Credit's right and title, the interpleader order sought by Empire Life is unnecessary. The surplutuses can and should be paid to all clients.  3) While there has been some disagreement as to the appropriate form and nature of additional relief or direction, it is important that the Court have the assistance of counsel advancing the arguments available to the insureds. 4) While the insured client class needs to participate in assisting the Court in determining whether the applicants or they as a class are entitled to receive the surplus, the economic realities of the litigation necessarily need to be recognized. 5) The insurance policy and predecessor polices contained provisions for 'Experience Credits' and 'Unearned Premium Reserve'. Each of the insurance policies referenced in s. 4(4) of the Saskatchewan Insurance Act provides for an interpleaded order permitting the insurer to contribute to the surplus and for an order releasing it from any further participation in the proceedings upon payment into court or as directed by the Court pursuant to s. 6-76 of the Queen's Bench Rules. Each insurer may appoint a representative party to advance the case and interests of that class"
6_2003skqb170.txt,"The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity. The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal. Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.","The appellant was convicted of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. His sentence was suspended with a 1-year probation order. He appealed from the conviction. HELD: The appeal was allowed and ordered a new trial.  1) The trial judge failed to properly consider the defence of necessity. He mischaracterized the complainant's testimony as being about bears and insects that could threaten the welfare of the complainant at night. 2) The court was unable to conclude that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced his finding of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault.  3) There was no miscarriage of justice resulting from the trial judge's error of law. It was immaterial whether there were injuries.  4) The conviction could not be set aside for that error of fact alone. 5) The sentencing judge erred in law by misapplying the appropriate test for a defence for necessity. 6) It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal for the conviction or to substitute a conviction for a conviction. It would be appropriate to substitute the conviction for an order of the Provincial Court in Saskatchewan."
e_2001skqb466.txt,"The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The plaintiff had been in the produce department of the store at around 3:45 p.m. when she suddenly slipped on a puddle of water on the floor. She was taken to the Pasqua Hospital Emergency Department where she was bandaged, given painkillers and advised to rest and see her family doctor if her injuries did not improve. Some of the injuries were at least in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff. 2)The plaintiff did not know the water was there but did know it could be found. The defendant did not file a separate affidavit confirming the water had been found. 3)There have been many cases that have found slippery substances such as water or produce on the Floor of a grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. The defendants have most often based the duty of care upon the invitor/invitee standard. 4)The plaintiffs evidence did not deviate from the usual frame of reference. The logs showed that the defendant was able to locate the logs on a regular basis. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance of the floor areas combined with the responsibility of each employee to carry them out were substantially the same if not identical to those considered by the Court in the Mollenhauer and Leibel group of cases. 5)The evidence was that neither the defendant nor its employees were required to participate in any kind of maintenance or cleaning in the store prior to the accident. The sweep log also showed that at 12:50 pm on March 28, 2000, the floor was wet and dry mopped by Cory Orban, who had recently left his employment with the defendant and could not be located."
4_2009skca102.txt,"The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","The Crown appealed a sentence of 26 months in pre-trial custody and 2 years probation imposed following the death of their 7-month-old daughter. The respondent had been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and had previously been convicted of manslaughter for the same offence. The Crown argued the sentencing judge erred by failing to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability in it. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis of this latter ground. 1) The essential facts were not in dispute. The mother was in good standing with her children and was doing well in school. 2) The father had a troubled history of abuse, domestic abuse and sexual abuse. She had failed to take steps to protect her children. 3) The mother's dysfunctional upbringing or dysfunctional life was put forth as aggravating factors. 4) The sentencing judge failed to give appropriate weight to both the seriousness of the offences and to the respondent’s moral responsibility. The factors set out in R. v. Schoenthal were not considered. 5) The court was satisfied the appeal should be allowed because these particular issues were considered and given appropriate weight by the sentencing court. 6) The sentence imposed was far too lenient for an adult who had a child of the same age. The father was sentenced to four years less a day, followed by two years probation."
e_2000canlii4625.txt,"The accused was charged with four offences relating to a twelve year old girl, including sexual assault and uttering a threat. He was released on bail with a surety. The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 771 for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into the the accused in the respect of a twelve year old girl. The accused was charged with four criminal matters, of sexual assault under s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, uttering a threat, sexual touching under s.(151) and unlawfully having a weapon. The surety denied any wrongdoing and said the accused had no concept of his obligations under the recognizizance. He mistakenly believed that his responsibilities or liability ended with the accused's first appearance in Court following his release. Certainly he was not aware that he himself could be subject to imprisonment under s773 in the event of default and was not made aware of that fact. HELD: The applications for forfeiture were dismissed. 1) The accused had absolutely no idea of his obligation under the agreement and he had mistakenly believed his responsibilities and liability had ended with his release following his incarceration. He was not even aware he was subject to any criminal charges. The ability to pay surety was not a factor to be considered.  2) Section 145 of the Code provides its own penalty for failure to appear for trial which is not acceptable in our system of criminal justice. The Crown had concluded that it would not be just and appropriate to order forfeiture against the accused. It would be perverse to order a forfeiture order against him on the basis of his obvious inability to earn income and the fact that he might be prone to severe financial liability if he were to suffer a serious injury or suffer a severe case of post-traumatic stress disorder. 3) The applicant had a reasonable prospect of earning income which would enable him to exercise his or her right to drive a motor vehicle in the foreseeable future. Since the accused would be unable to pay any amount that may be ordered against him and would be liable for a double punishment for his failure to comply with his obligations, forfeiture should not be ordered."

The appellant's solicitor presented solicitor and client accounts of $19,420 plus taxes. The respondent directed taxation, and the appellant's solicitor submitted further accounts for services and disbursements of the taxation hearing amounting to $7,212.24. The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000. He proceeded to tax the account at $14,000, disallowed any costs of the taxation hearing, and disallowed a claim for interest on interim accounts submitted by the solicitor. The appellants appealed.

He was entitled to consider as one of the relevant factors the relationship of the total account to the recovery.","The expropriation of land by the City of Halifax City Council in 1993 was a result of a resolution to expropriate the land for widening the Bedford Highway. The land was originally intended to be used as a retaining wall. The construction of the retaining wall began in February 1994 and was completed in June 1994. In October 1994, the City Council abandoned the expropriated land retaining only an easement necessary for the footing. The solicitor for the appellant appealed the decision, which the City held was an error. Allowing the appeal and the taxation of costs, that the errors by the Taxing Master were minor and not indicative of the overall position of the appellant. The appellant's solicitor-client account was taxed by Arthur Hare and in a decision in August 1995 he reduced the account to $14,000 plus taxes. The TaxingMaster was correct in declining to award the sum of $5,855 to the appellant solicitor. This amounts to $19,420 plus taxes representing approximately 100 hours time spent on the file."

While taking the appellant to where the incident occurred, the officer noted slight smell of alcohol and bloodshot eyes. The appellant failed the ALERT test and refused the breathalyzer. The refusal charge was dismissed and the appellant was convicted of impaired driving. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The evidence of impairment was too weak to convict the appellant. The officer told the accused that if he passed the ALERT test, he would be sent on his way. Thus, she must not have thought that the appellant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired.

That decision was not under appeal. The appeal was allowed and the conviction quashed. The trial judge then heard the Crown and the defence's evidence. The operative part of the decision was that the trial judge did not address the defence evidence adduced that the appellant had bloodshot eyes and a moderate smell of alcohol on him. He had apparently concluded that in the event he had failed the screening device he was capable of continuing to drive. The Court considered the entire transcript of the evidence in relation to the burden of proof required in an impaired driving charge as enunciated in R. v.

This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person. The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","The tenant appealed a decision of the Office of Residential Tenancies. The tenant had signed a 3-year lease in the landlord's home and had attempted to rent it for the past three years. The landlord had refused to vacate and the tenant sought an order for possession. The hearing officer found that the landlord had breached the tenant's rights by not providing proper written notice to vacue and sought possession of the property. The owner of the rental unit also appealed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The Act applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. 2)The hearing officer did not err in deciding she did not have the jurisdiction to deal with the issue. 3)The tenancy agreement between the landlord and tenant was invalid. The tenants had entered a written tenancy agreement in good faith. There was no express or implied consent by the tenant to the terms of the agreement. 4)The Hearing Officer made no error in law in finding that the tenant was not prejudiced by any error or omission in the written agreement.  5)Section 70 of the Residential Tenancy Act provides for an order respecting any tenancy agreement, rental unit or other residential property. Section 7 of the Act provides that a landlord may make an order pursuant to s.7(f)(i) of the tenancy agreement for a fixed term tenancy of three months or longer. 6)The tenants had a tenancy agreement with the landlord. The Hearing Officer did not erred in law by finding that neither the landlord nor the tenant had valid tenancy agreement. 7)The tenant had a right to possess the rental property. 8)Section 8 of the Code of Conduct provides for the hearing officer to inquire into the tenant’s conduct in entering into the lease. 9)Section 10 of the Charter provides that certain documents must be made to the Hearing Officer in order to determine the extent of estoppel. 10)Section 11 of the Trade Union Act applies. 11)The Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to hear an application by a tenant for possession of a rental unit. The Court of Queen’S Bench has jurisdiction in this case to hear such an application. 12)Section 19 of the LEA Act provides the standard legal names of persons who have or possess a rental property during a tenancy and for the purposes of section 7 the Hearing officer made an order that the Landlord withdraw the notice ot[sic] vacate."
5_1994canlii4866.txt,"The Plaintiff's 1989 Ford F150 1/2 ton truck caught fire and burned in his garage. This model of truck was subject to a recall by Ford to correct a fuel line defect. The Plaintiff called several expert witnesses who testified that, in their opinion, the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire. Ford called one witness who was the designer of of the truck's fuel system and a Ford employee. He testified that the defective fuel line could not have leaked sufficient fuel to cause the fire. He also admitted, however, that his prior written report contained errors. Rebuttal evidence called by the Plaintiff indicated that the check valve in the fuel pump designed to prevent siphoning from the fuel tank in the event of a leaking fuel line did not operate as the Ford witness had testified. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff had proved on a balance of probabilities that the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire. The Plaintiff's experts' evidence was accepted over that of the Ford expert. No independent experts had been called by Ford.","The plaintiffs claim against Ford for damages from a fire in their garage which they allege was caused by combustion of vapours from gasoline leakage from the fuel tube of a new truck they purchased from Ford. The action against Country Plaza was discontinued. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs have proven beyond a balance of probabilities that the fire was causedby an electric static discharge through the U-shaped fuel tube in the Ford truck. Due to extreme winter weather the electrical insulating qualities of the nylon fuel line were reduced to an extent that the accumulated static electricity discharged through the fuel line. This resulted in a temporary static discharge which ignited the fuel in the central heating system and the fire occurred. 2)The Court accepted the expert testimony of the plaintiffs and their expert evidence in preference to the defendant. 3)The plaintiff never called any independent witnesses on their behalf and their only witness was an employee of the company. 4)The evidence established that the cause of the fire (the fire) was an electrical static discharge in the fuel rod which was a problem with the wiring in the truck. During this static discharge, pin holes would be created and gasoline would leak out. The vapours would settle to the bottom of the garage and be attracted to the pilot light on the furnace. The flames would flare up in the area underneath the vehicle where the gasoline was pooled. This would likely be in the wash tray which was located under the vehicle and which Clarence used to wash his truck. 5)The court found that the plaintiffs had established a theory as to how the fire started that was supported by evidence such as the attendance at the scene and the date of the recall notice."

The father sought to reduce the support contained in the 1997 divorce judgment which incorporated the parties' interspousal agreements regarding custody, access and child and spousal support. The parties were married in 1985 and separated in 1995. The mother was on leave from her employment. When his federal government management position was declared redundant, the applicant received a retiring allowance of $75,646 in May 1997. The respondent opposed the application on the basis there had been no change in circumstances since the judgment was granted; she had no other income than the support payments and child tax credit; alternatively, there were special provisions in the parties' separation agreement which would permit the court to award an amount that differs from the amount prescribed by the Guidelines.HELD: 1)The judgment the applicant sought to vary was made after the coming into force of the Guidelines. It did not however include a determination of child support made in accordance with the Guidelines. There was no change in the childrens' or mother's circumstances. The applicant was unemployed but was still benefiting from his retiring allowance at the time of the order which he no longer enjoyed. A variation was warranted as there had been a change in the father's financial means and circumstances. The Guideline support obligation for two children is $341 per month.  2)It could not be concluded on the evidence presented that there was any special provision in the parties' agreement that directly or indirectly benefited either child. The provision for child support in a specified amount greater than that provided in the Guidelines was not a 'special provision' as contemplated by s17(6.2) of the Divorce Act given the change in circumstances of the applicant whose annual income had dropped from $55,500 to $24,000 a year.  3)No order was made as to costs.","FIAT.

Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the mother had custody of the children and the applicant had reasonable access on reasonable notice.

e_2009skca40.txt,"This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","This was an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant sought to set aside the transaction under various heads of contract law including duress, undue influence, unconscionability, equitable fraud and mistake. The claims against the solicitor are without a factual basis. The trial judge made critical findings of fact, including probative evidence, which was supported by candid admissions at trial. HELD: The appeals against both the Clements and the solicitors were dismissed. 1)The contract was a valid contract. The terms were indeed favourable to the purchasers. The contract was therefore advantageous to the appellant. 2)The timing of the meeting was absolutely necessary to satisfy the appellant who was fully versed in the subject matter and who was prepared to perform an independent performance. 3)The meeting was not necessary or necessary in view of the fact that the appellant was in her late 80s and the husband's expert in legal practice was not relevant. 4)The issues raised were whether the standard of review had been met in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) and whether the standards were met."
8_1995canlii4370.txt,"The respondent landowner haphazardly painted his buildings in order to protest a decision of Halifax city council. The city charged the respondent under the unsightly premises provisions of the Halifax City Charter. At trial, the court held the wording of the City Charter could not support the charge, and that a conviction would violate the respondent's s.2(b) Charter rights to freedom of expression. The city appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge did not commit an error in law. S.363(3) of the Halifax City Charter, under which the respondent was charged, refers to land as opposed to buildings, and cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings, a category already dealt with in s.363(6), which covers the unsightliness of buildings caused by neglect, not overt actions.","The respondent owned several buildings converted into apartment units. The proposal to replace these buildings with high density apartments was rejected by Halifax City Council. The Crown appealed, raising two grounds: 1) that the trial judge erred in law in her interpretation of s. 363 of the Halifax City Charter; and 2) that when the legislators turned their minds to the unsightliness of buildings, they drafted subsection 6. This section deals exclusively with wood shavings, paper sawdust, dry and inflammable grass or weeds. This type of wood is not exclusive to residential land and is not common in the city. Wood tends to be in the type of land used for driveways, parks and other public spaces but is mostly used for parking. Wood is not used in the context of the entire section. It is used to drive vehicles, cars and other non-vehicle-related surfaces.Wood is not an exclusive land and therefore not exclusive. It has no application to the exclusive exclusive land of this type. Wood surfaces are often used as driveways or to driveways in the residential area. Wood on land adjacent to the parking lot or in the adjacent residential area is often used. Wood and other wood surfaces are not to be considered in isolation as they are not in the exclusive land class.Wood and other materials are to be used as surfaces in buildings. Wood, grass and other refuse are not considered in this section. Wood will only be used for the purpose of 'rotten surfaces' as opposed to 'open and unsightly' land.Wood will not be used in this type of application. The appellant's application for a conviction was dismissed. The trial judge made no error in law.S. 363(3) must be construed in a manner that does not invoke s. 24 of the Charter."

The court found that the appellant had attempted to portray himself as being good to the children but had admitted on cross-examination that the children had been removed from the home due to allegations of physical abuse and lack of food. There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","The appellant appeals his conviction by Crawford, J.P.C. on a charge of sexual assault. The appellant testified at trial, denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant says that his conviction is a miscarriage of justice because the judge based her rejection of his testimony on material misapprehensions of the evidence. HELD: The conviction is set aside. 1) The court found that the judge misapprehended evidence. The judge ascribed to the evidence about the involvement of Children's Services, relevance that it simply could not have, and the inference drawn from this evidence could not be more unjustified. 2) The judge's reasons for rejecting the appellant's evidence were based on misappreciation of theevidence. 3) The trial judge's evidence about being 'good to the children' did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. 4) The Court found a pattern of inconsistency in the appellant’s evidence."
d_1990canlii4118.txt,"In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice. The plaintiff had correctly interpreted the clause as relating to the termination of the agreement, not of his employment. The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta. The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months. He was also awarded the loss resulting from the difference in vacation and loss of an auto allowance for the 15 months. For emotional trauma, which lasted only briefly, he received $500.","This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff, an American citizen, commenced working for the defendant company in 1952 as an expatriate. He was assigned to various positions in the company, mostly as office manager. In 1983, he was reassigned to another position and then became a regional manager. He went on to work for several years as a senior level surveyor until December 1986. He received a salary of $67,389.95. In 1986, he received notice of his employment termination. He applied to the Federal Civil Service for a position in the same position and was refused. In 1989, the defendant hired the plaintiff as manager of a new office. He claimed that the clause of the agreement which provided for three months notice of termination had been never specifically drawn to the plaintiff's attention. He alleged that this clause did not refer to termination by the defendant but rather to his continued employment as an employee. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff was entitled to reasonable notice. 2)30 days notice was not sufficient to abrogate the doctrine of law that reasonable notice must be given. 3)The defendant gave 30 days notice. That the plaintiff was out of country and had no place to seek employment in the new office and therefore had no excuse to move. 4)The defendants' argument that the plaintiff should have been given 30 days' notice was rejected. 5)30 day notice would be a harsh term as the defendant did not have cause to dismiss him."
2006skqb382.txt,"The petitioner seeks child and spousal support. The parties signed a separation agreement and interspousal contract in July 2004. With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1) The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum. The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'. This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support. The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist. 2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program. Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year. The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006. It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000.

The petitioner sought to set aside the settlement agreement on the grounds of undue influence and duress or alternatively that the agreement was unfair and unconscionable.

The accused’s conduct over the past 18 months satisfied the court on the balance of probabilities that hers was an exceptional case and that a curative discharge would not be contrary to the public interest. The court imposed numerous conditions on her, including that she could not have or consume alcohol and should report to a probation officer, receive addiction counselling, participate in AA meetings and provide proof of her attendance to her probation officer.

b_2006nssc221.txt,"Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement. Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The applicant, who was the mother of a daughter, applied to vary the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment in light of the terms of the 2003 agreement. The parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation and had received a Corollari Relief Judgment, which incorporated the provisions of the Agreement. The applicant had received professional advice and assistance from a number of experienced lawyers and had obtained a doctorate in English. She believed the agreement was in substantial compliance with the objectives of the Divorce Act and that it was intended to relieve her of financial burdens arising from the divorce and to allow her to enter the workforce. She also believed that the agreement represented a significant departure from the general objectives of both parties and that changes in circumstances were not reasonably anticipated by the parties and had led to a situation that cannot be condoned. The onus is on the applicant to satisfy the Court that the Agreement was not in substantial compliant with the Act and to demonstrate that the Respondent did not take advantage of any vulnerability of the applicant. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The Agreement was sound when signed and there had been no change in the circumstances. The respondent's income had not changed. The rental income more than covered the mortgage payment. 2)There was no pressure exerted upon the applicant and no oppression during the course of the negotiations or the signing of the agreement and the rental income did not exceed the amount paid by the respondent. There was no evidence of coersion or anything of that nature. 3)The agreement was not unconscionable. The Agreement was based on a reasonable expectation of retirement which was met by the applicant's needs and objectives. The greater the vulnerabilities present at the time of formation, the more likely she was to have difficulty and perhaps lose a chance at obtaining such a position. 4)The Court found that there had not been substantial change in circumstances since signing the Agreement and that there was no breach of any of the objectives set out in Miglin (supra). 5)The parties were bound by the provisions contained in the agreement.  6)The court found that the parties had not taken steps to reduce the burden on each other. The agreement was binding and the Court ordered that the respondent take steps to ensure that the applicant would not have difficulty in obtaining the position she sought. The court ordered the respondent to pay $5,500 per month in spousal support until November 1, 2003 and thereafter in the sum of $4,535."
d_2016skpc75.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay. As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered. The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay. The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable.","The accused, charged with 56 offences, including conspiracy to commit the indictable offence of fraud by printing and/or cashing forged cheques, defrauding or attempting to defraud contrary to s. 380(1)(b) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession of a counterfeit mark contrary to section 376(2)(b). The accused alleged that his right to a fair trial had been infringed. He sought a judicial stay of proceedings on the basis that the previous eight Informations had been sworn against him and that the Crown had not established on a balance of probabilities that there had been a breach of his rights to be tried within a reasonable time. Dismissing the application for a stay, that the accused has not established that there has been an unreasonable delay in his trial and society's interest will not parallel that of the accused."
3_1995canlii6053.txt,"The accused was charged with failing to appear at his trial on a charge of impaired driving. The impaired driving charge was subsequently stayed. When the charge of failing to appear came on for trial the accused claimed a 'lawful excuse' for his failure to appear on the impaired driving charge. His excuse was that the next shift at work had failed to arrive on time and that this had made it impossible for him to get to court on time. This excuse was rejected and he was convicted. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Whether an accused has a lawful excuse is determined with reference to common law principles. It normally includes all of the defences which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 2)The Court was unable to say that the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor could it say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.",The accused sought to overturn his conviction for failing to attend court by arguing that the trial judge ought to have accepted his excuse for not appearing. At issue was whether the accused advanced a 'lawful excuse' for not attending court. HELD: The appeal was challenged on appeal. 1)The trial judge rejected the accused's submission that he had a 'lawsful excuse'. 2)The accused had previously informed his lawyer of the court date. The Crown had stayed the original impaired driving charge which was stayed by the Crown. 3)The s7(3) of the Criminal Code provides that the common law defences are not frozen in time. They can be developed and tailored to fit changes in the law and new offences. There was no doubt that Parliament can redefine the meaning of 'excuse' for example by expanding it to provide new excuses or excuses specific to a particular offence or by narrowing it to include only certain excuses.

5_2001skqb463.txt,"This judgment applies to both QBG No. 1040/98 and QBG No. 1041/98 respecting the contract between the city and Triple P Holdings and the January 21, 1997 contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required. The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.","The two contracts that play in this case are the contract between the City of Regina and Triple P Holdings operated by the defendants and the same two defendants. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the City, the general thrust of all of the evidence was that certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to the members of the Independent Truckers Association. The plaintiffs failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged on that breach and that any breach occurred. HELD: The plaintiffs were entitled to damages from the defendants for breach of contract dated January 21, 1997 and with reference to the Contract between the defendant and the city of Regina.  1)The plaintiffs had constructed their cases in reliance upon the overall affect of both contracts with specific emphasis on the contract of January 1997. The defendant made some effort to include the plaintiffs in the rotation. 2)The single issue of privity was overwhelmed by the larger issue as to what really is the contract alleged to have been breached. The case will not turn on the question of privities. While they were not actually parties to that contract with Regina, the generally thrust of the case was that some benefits intended to be passed through a general contract passed through the collective contract to members of an independent trucking association. The factual evidence was in conflict but found that the defendants made some efforts to include them. 3)There is no contractual obligation in the agreement between the plaintiffs and the City that requires the defendants to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract obligates the plaintiff to provide services according to the maximum allotment of hours provided by the City to the plaintiff. The Court cannot rely on the word 'excess' by the plaintiffs. 4)The Court must decide the case as presented; that the plaintiffs are entitled to $12,500 from the defendant for breach and with references to the contracts between the defendants, the city and the independent truckers association.  5)Costs were awarded to the plaintiffs based on the performance of the plaintiffs so far. 6)Each case was dismissed."

Eventually they turned the franchise back and sued for damages alleging that the Defendants had interfered in their attempts to sell the franchise and had wrongfully refused to consent to a sale negotiated by the Plaintiffs. The Defendants counterclaimed for unpaid royalties and rent. The parties each prepared and served their Statements as to Documents. Both parties then applied for production of additional documents under Rule 212. The Defendant also sought further particulars of certain matters referred to in the Plaintiff's Defence to Counterclaim under Rule 164. HELD: Applications allowed. Both of the parties were ordered to produce some of the documents requested. 1)A party must disclose all documents which may contain information which either directly or indirectly enables the other party to advance his case or to damage the case of his adversary.  2)The test of relevance on discovery is wider than that of admissibility at trial. 3)Documents brought into existence with the dominant purpose of using them in order to obtain legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation which is in reasonable prospect at the time of their creation are privileged. 4)Particulars are appropriate only (i)to enable a party to properly plead in response or (ii)to eliminate surprise. 5)The Court found that further particulars were appropriate in this case on the second ground, given the vague nature of the impugned paragraph in the Plaintiff's Defence to Counterclaim.","FIAT. The first plaintiff brought an interlocutory application seeking production of documents by the defendants. The second plaintiff sought an order for documents by requesting an order in respect to the plaintiffs documents and an order that the plaintiffs provide further and betterparticulars. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The plaintiff was not prepared in anticipation of litigation. The defendants had prepared a statement of claim and issued a counterclaim. The counterclaim alleged improper charges. 2)The requested documents related to the franchise agreement, lease, advertising, signage and other documents. 3)The letter was not privileged and therefore not privileged. 4)The affidavits, tapes, receipts and bank records of commissions received by the plaintiff corporation were not relevant. 5)Any documents relating to advertising were to be produced. 6)The memoranda and copies of the letter were not ordered produced. 7)The application to compel the plaintiffs to produce the documents was dismissed. 8)The request for particulars was so broad and general that it would require the defendants to literally produce every piece of paper in their possession. Much of that would be irrelevant. 9)All agreements between the defendants as they relate to the franchises in Canada and Saskatchewan were not privileged because they precede the letter. 10)The affidavit and the viva voce filed by the plaintiffs was not relevant as they did not provide the necessary information to further advance the plaintiff's and defendant's case. 11)The defendants were not prepared to pay costs in any event of the cause and fix those costs at $200. 12)The plaintiffs were not entitled to any other award for services rendered other than in the granting of the requested documents. 13)The claim for damages arising from an alleged defamation of the defendants was not dismissed. 14)The applicant was entitled to costs in the amount of $1,000 for the privilege of producing the documents and the same amount for the cause of the counterclaim and for the counter-claim. 15)The Court declined to order production of the documents. 16)The Certificate of Analysis was not ordered as it did not comply with Queen's Bench Rule 14. 17(1) and (2)Queen's Bench rule 14.04."
c_2006skqb335.txt,"FIAT: The former vice-president of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan. He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour. He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application. Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart. It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart. The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart. HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed. The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.  1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit. This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility. The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents. 2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents. There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.  3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart. Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations. Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart. However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them. Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias. To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy. That is not good enough.","FIAT: Wal-Mart Canada Corp. (Wal-Mart) brought three applications. The first motion was brought by the Union of Food and Commercial Workers (UFT) which sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and Rule 673 prohibiting the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board as presently constituted from hearing and/or making any orders involving Wal-Marts. The union applied for an order striking and removing virtually all the material filed in support of the application. In the other motion the union applied to strike and remove three newspaper articles and an article from the Regina Leader-Post. At the relevant time, Wal-mart became aware of these articles and was aware that they were critical and disparaging of the applicant. It filed this application to dismiss the application and brought the application by Wal- Mart. Wal-marts argued that there was no necessity for their admission and that the applicant must be available to swear an affidavit. Absent any explanation for his absence, there is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proferred documents as evidence. HELD: The relief sought by the union was granted. The application was dismissed. There is no necessity to their admission. Mr. Matkowski is around and about. He must be able to swear affidavits. The critical allegations originate with him. Absent an explanation for him, there has no basis for it to conclude the application should be dismissed.  1) The admissibility of the newspapers was not proven. There was no admissible evidence. The admissible materials were the same as the materials filed. 2) The affidavits were admissible by reason of s. 7 of the Saskatchewan Evidence Act. They were not sworn and as such are not admissible. The statements of fact relating to the articles and articles were not proven and there was nothing about the accuracy, truth or reliability of what was contained in the transcript. 3) There is nothing in the affidavits which go to the extent of proving interference by the Department of Labour with the Board or, much more importantly, that any member actually read them. They are admissible to prove interference with the board or to prove the existence of bias. The provisions in s. 27(1) and (2) of the Act enable the testimony of the Board member as to the content of the newsletters to be proven. 4) The provisions of the Trade Union Act enables the testimony and comments of the member who was able to read the newsletters and the articles in the Regina Star-Post without interference."
6_2008skca156.txt,"The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","The Crown appealed an order of a Provincial Court judge declaring that the respondent was unfit to stand trial for offences committed between March 2006 and August 2007. The Crown contended the trial judge misapprehended the evidence, misstated the evidence and applied the wrong legal test for fitness, applied the incorrect burden of proof and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal allowed. The limited cognitive capacity test (LGB) test is an effective balance between the objectives of the fitness rules and the constitutional right of the accused to choose his own defence and to have a trial within a reasonable time. The respondent had not been convicted in relation to any of the alleged offences and had not shown that he possessed the capacity to reason on higher cognitive levels, because of his lack of abstraction, and because of being 'locked in his delusional system'. The respondent did not meet the objectives set out in R. v. Taylor (1992), [1993] and [1994] and was still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board."
2002skqb125.txt,"FIAT. The issue was whether costs should be assessed against the plaintiffs because the two motions served by the plaintiffs were not filed at the Court House prior to the return date as required by the Queen's Bench Rules;  the motion filed at the Court House was not served on the defendants; plaintiff's counsel advised the defendants that the two motions which had been served on them were not in fact going to proceed. HELD: Given the lawyer's representation as to the amount of stress he was under, it would not be appropriate in the circumstances to assess costs against the plaintiffs over the conduct of their counsel or against counsel directly or at this time. The matter was left to the trial judge.","FIAT. On January 24, 2002, the matter was heard in chambers and the issue was to be determined by the trial judge in the course of the action. The plaintiffs' counsel was under extreme pressure and lot of stress lately with respect to this file and others and therefore had prepared three motions which were fairly similar to one another. In his confusion he had filed some and not filed others. HELD: 1)The matter had been heard in January 2002 and was reserved on the issue of whether costs should be assessed against the plaintiffs. 2)Because of the peculiar circumstances surrounding the three applications, the applications were dismissed. There was a request by the defendants' counsel to have the matter addressed by way of costs. 3)Given the representation of the counsel as to the amount of stress that he was presently under, it was not appropriate in the circumstances to assess costs against them over the conduct of their counsel or against the counsel directly at this time. Accordingly, the Court left the matter to the trial court in its course of this action."

The defence wants further disclosure. HELD: The essence of the authorities is that on motions of this kind the Court ought to guard against the pursuit of what have been termed 'fishing expeditions'—speculative quests for information without any real expectation about the outcome of the quest or its relevance to the case. Here, however, the defence has already indicated that issues around s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter will be raised at trial. Defence now wants further disclosed of information. The Crown shall make timely disclosure of: (a) the number of stops of out-of-province vehicles made by Constable Chornecki in each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004; (b) the reason for each stop in the first place; (c) the reasons for each stopped; (d) Specifics of any other grounds for searches that were applied and how many times; (g) On how many occasions did the searches result in the finding of contraband, including narcotics; (7) the actual notes of the officer to be reproduced.

5_2008skca56.txt,"The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment. The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault and using a weapon contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and s. 267(a) of the Code. He was tried by a jury, which convicted him. The appellant argued that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in his charge. HELD: The appeal against conviction was dismissed.  1) The trial judge was of the opinion that the complainant's testimony would not stand up under scrutiny and did not stand Up under scrutiny, and that his purpose was to draw the jury's attention to that which significantly corroborated the central testimony of the complainant. 2) The evidence of the Crown was that the accused had not been told that he had touched her sexually without her consent. 3) The appeal of the appellant against his conviction was allowed on the basis that the Crown's closing argument should have been related to the issue of whether the accused should have taken the opportunity to appear personally or have legal counsel represent him on his appeal."

M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code. After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions. HELD: The accused is sentenced to 9 months incarceration. Pursuant to s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code, a firearm order was made for 10 years prohibiting the accused from possessing any type of weapon. The accused shall also supply a sample of his DNA for analysis. There is an order under s. 490.012(1) that the accused comply with the Sexual Offender Information Registration Act.

He had been in a residential school for three and one-half years and had previously been convicted of sexual assault. He lived with his step-grandmother (a.M.) for some time. His sexual touching occurred at his residence on the Muscowpetung First Nation Reserve on occasions when she would visit with him and her mother on weekends. HELD: The accused was sentenced to 9 months to be served in a correctional institute.  1) This is not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The maximum sentence in case such as this is 10 years but it also provides a compulsory minimum sentence of incarceration of not less than 45 days. 2) The accused did not have any significant or related criminal record. He appeared to be well settled in a new relationship. His mother was a good person and her support of his family was significant. 3) The Court found that the accused had not shown any remorse or lack of concern for his stepmother."
8_2006skca58.txt,"All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement. They also agree that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause. It is clear that the subject matter of the clause is a 'Participating Interest in the Program Land or a Project Area'. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement. However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole. Accordingly, the voting agreement is not caught by subsection 14.01.","All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV of the joint venture agreement, s. 14.01 of which provides that: If a party wishes to sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its Participating Interest, the parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of its participating Interest, that party shall be entitled to a right of refusal in respect thereof as provided by the terms of the agreement. The voting agreement secured the follow up steps under the original commitment by Cameco which would be implemented over a lengthy period. The respondents Cameco and UEM preferred the Kensington plan and were prepared to commit themselves to it. They took the position that they had exercised their right to vote by entering into the voting agreement, rather than having sold their vote by so doing. The vote agreement secured follow up actions under the initial commitment by Kensington which would also be implemented in a lengthy time. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to be taxed."

The issue is whether the plaintiff's claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act, and if so, whether the affidavit filed in support of the issuance of both of the pre-judgment garnishees complies with s. 3(2) of the Act. HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.  1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons. 2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand. Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement. 3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant. The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing. Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing.","FIAT: The applicant sought an order pursuant to s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act setting aside the plaintiff's pre-judgment garnishee in which $2,291.90 was paid into Court from the defendant's bank account at Biggar and District Credit Union on December 7, 2005. The issue is whether the claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act and if so, whether the affidavit of the applicant filed in support of the issuance of both the pre- and garnishees complies with s.3(2) of that Act. HELD: 1) The affidavit of a defence and counterclaim filed by the applicant was not considered. Although there was reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0% per month, compounded monthly, there was no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement of September 10, 2001.  2) The plaintiff's claim disclosed a prima facie claim for debt or liquidated damage pursuant to ss. 3.1(1)(b)(iv) and the affidavit as cited by the affidavit contained the required precision the amount of the debt owing by the defendant. 3) There are four purposes of an affidavit filed pursuant to the Act as outlined by Bayda in Conexus. 4) The affidavits filed by an applicant and a copy of an invoice do not appear to be complete.  5) The Court was not able to determine whether the content of the affidavit was a complete and accurate representation of the amount owing on the judgment, the debt or the liquidation demand as the case may be.  6) There were no reference in any of the statements of claim or statement of defence or counterclaim. 7) Although there is a reference to interest in an agreement between the parties that the indebtedness on account would be subject to interest at the rate of 2.5 per month compounded monthly. 8) The four pages of the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit were true copies of the operating agreement and the four page salesale. 9) It is trite law that a plaintiff has a statutory right to garnish the defendant’s funds before the validity of the claim has been determined if the action is for a debt or a liquidative demand.

She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party. Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work. She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","The father applied for a change to the Corollary Relief Judgment, alleging that the mother had denied him access and communication with his children. The father had been denied access for multiple sclerosis since 2006. He had been prescribed medical marijuana by his doctor and had been prohibited from driving for three years. The doctor had based his application on the symptoms of multiple sclerosis, which he alleged were caused by his medical condition, his marijuana use and his driving. He argued these symptoms were not independent statements, and that he would not allow the children to smoke marijuana in the presence of his mother. The evidence showed the father's medical condition and its effect on his ability to drive had contributed to the breakdown of the marriage. He requested that all restrictions on his transport of the children be removed including the provision restricting their marijuana use to eight hours prior prior to driving. The mother objected to the restrictions because she alleged they were discriminatory and would alienate the children from their father. Application dismissed; the evidence showed that the father took into account and accepted responsibility for some of the circumstances leading to the failure of his children to visit his father. Although the father had indicated that his use of marijuana was benign and without potential risk to his children, the court was not satisfied that the doctor's evidence raised questions about his use and whether it was in the children's best interests to ignore these risks or to place the entire responsibility for monitoring their safety on their shoulders. The assessor did not consider it appropriate that his good judgement should be questioned by the imposition of restrictions in respect to his driving with the children."

This order was then brought before a Queen's Bench Judge as required by s.5 of the Act for review. The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section. The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered.

It is an extraordinary remedy to be granted only where serious and urgent circumstances indicate a need for prompt action to protect the victim. 2)Absent such urgency, the application should be one for a 'victim's assistance order' brought to a Queen's Bench Judge in Chambers under s.7 in accordance with The Queen's Bench Rules. 3)In this case the domestic violence complained of occurred on January 28. There was no evidence that on February 1, 1995, Dolgopol was at risk of immediate harm. There was by then no element of urgency and the application for relief should have awaited the regular Queen's Bench Family Law Division chamber sittings.  4)The Court commented that it was unclear whether this rehearing was to proceed de novo or as a review but determined that the order should not stand in any event and therefore terminated it forthwith.","FIAT.

Dismissing the action with costs, that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier. With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work. As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff. Therefore, the supplier was not entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond.","After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, a supplier of materials to the sub contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a Labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the subcontractor. The contract stipulated that the respondent be a surety with respect to the principal amount owing to the subcontractor. In the absence of a contract, the respondent would not have been entitled to recover anything due to the third party statutory liens. HELD: The claim of the respondent against the general contractors and London Guarantee was dismissed. 1)The mechanics' lien fund which would have been available to subcontractors if the Mechanics' Lien Act had applied applied would have consisted of the greater of 10% of the value of the work completed by All Ports at the time All Ports abandoned its work under the subcontract. 2)The Mechanics'Lien Act does not expressly state that it binds the Crown. 3)The evidence showed no intention to contract, no valuable consideration, and no promise to pay. Since those third party claims total an amount greater than the amount of the holdback, potential lien claimants such as Hazmasters would not be entitled to recovered any amount from the respondent."

The defendant monitored the temperature in the freezer and cooler at the business. The plaintiffs sued because their freezer failed and meat spoiled after a circuit breaker at the business tripped off. The defendant had received no alarm. The plaintiff asserts that the defendant breached the contract by failing to properly monitor the temperature in the freezer. HELD: The contract between the parties was solely for installation and monitoring. The contract did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair the equipment at the plaintiff's business. The Court was satisfied that the defendant was monitoring the signal from the plaintiff's business on the dates in question and no alarm was received. It is not possible to say with any certainty why the defendant did not receive an alarm, but the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff was regularly having its monitoring equipment serviced or repaired. The plaintiff has not proven that the defendant breached the contract. The action is dismissed.","HELD: The action was dismissed. It was not possible on the evidence to say with any certainty why Gardon Securities did not receive such an alarm generated by the rising of the freezer temperature at Sturgis Meats or by how it was adjusted. The monitoring was done by the Gardon staff in Yorkton, based on information transmitted by the monitoring equipment over a telephone line from the business. There was not in the view proof to that standard that the reason Gardon had not receive a freezer temperature alarm from Sturgias Meats was within their control. Based on the original contract between the parties and ongoing payments being made in 2010, the contract between them was solely for the monitoring of the temperature in the cooler and freezer at the business and did not include any obligation on Gardon to maintain or repair the monitoring hardware at that business. HELD: 1)It is possible that there was a so-called glitch in the monitoring system that could have resulted in no freezer alarm being received by them so it could be reported to SturgIS Meats. It is equally possible that a hacker or someone at another business could have set the alarm at the company and then set the equipment off. 2)There is not in my view proof that the breach of the contract by the defendant breached this contract by failing to monitor the temperature at the plaintiff's premises and failing to respond to the plaintiff. There is no evidence that either the plaintiff or the defendant's employees monitored the signal from the plaintiff on the dates in question and that they did not. 3)The plaintiff did not provide any explanation for the failure of its monitoring equipment. The detailed computer records, which are unalterable, and the nature of the computer back-up system at Gardon ensured that there were no failures of the equipment."
e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent seeks to expunge child support arrears that have accumulated as a result of his not paying child support for many years. He is 72 years old and practising internal medicine in the United States. The petitioner is disabled and the respondent is a pediatrician. HELD: 1) The respondent's application to reduce or eliminate child support is dismissed.  1) It is common for a payor to stop recording ongoing child support payments once the children have turned 18. The fact remains that the respondent, who is a medical doctor, has not been paying support for the past 12 years. Rather than seek employment that could pay him handsomely, he chose to flail away in private practice for years and earn much less than he otherwise would have. The Court does not accept the assertion that he is incapable of paying. It has determined that his child support obligations are based on his actual income over the years. 2) The father will have a few lean years to pay off the arrear. He did not have the ability to pay the support willingly it had to be snatched away from him. 3) The petitioner has always been a child of the marriage. She has always believed in the principles of self sufficiency and in the absence of any special circumstance, the respondent has failed to do so. The court cannot find that the father does not have that ability. 4) The Court reviewed the various orders issued in respect to the child support payable in respect of the 1998 and 2001 orders. The 1998 order was varied and therefore his childsupport obligations were still calculated on an income of $109,912. 5) The 2001 order was inconsistently varied. The s. Guideline amount for this period was $1,493 per month for a total of $107,496 ($1,687 72). The s.(e)of the 3 orders, the Court found that it would be unfair to the respondent to deprive the petitioner of her child support obligation when she is nearing the end of her useful life. 6) Applying the criteria set out in Wurmlinger and D.B.S., the Court concluded that the petitioner had the ability and obligation under the 1998 order to pay child support ended even though the respondent did not record it on its statement. 7) The court found that the child remains a Child of the Marriage until age 59. The arrearns accumulated over the span of 12 years are approximately $183,746. The respondent cannot be faulted for his choice to"
e_2009nssc204.txt,"An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment. The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","The appellant was a student at a university when he sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the professor did not take the content of the attachment as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The Crown alleged the appellant intended to kill the professor and that the words written as threat were meant to intimidate or be taken seriously. The trial judge dismissed the Crown's evidence as being totally irrelevant to the charges, worse that the objective of the evidence was rife with hearsay and prejudicial to the appellant's credibility. New counsel took over carriage of the appeal and the appellant sought an acquittal, a new trial or conditional discharge. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The evidence raised no issues with respect to the admissibility of evidence, the appropriateness of questions asked of the appellant in cross-examination and the impact these matters may have on the integrity and fairness of the trial; the elements of the offence that the Crown needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt were dealt with. 2)The trial judge rejected the appellant’s testimony as not being credible and in accord with the intent of the Crown. He asked the appellant if he had ever met the professor. The appellant testified that he had. He said he had not. 3)There were no formal or informal admissions by the defence and the court reviewed the whole of the case and found that the trial judge had no legitimate reason to call the expert witness. The expert witness’ testimony was not considered credible and the Crown did not have to enter a voir dire to determine if the expert had any relevant evidence. 4)There was no evidence that the appellant, who was not counsel at trial, or even initially on the appeal, would have drawn the inference that he intended to get reaction from the reader of the email from the message that he received. That inference could not be drawn from the evidence presented by the expert. The only reasonable inference that one could draw was that he thought that someone was monitoring his typing and he intended the recipient to read the contents of the e-mail, including the phrase that just described. It was not his intention to kill anyone."

Ace had been subpoenaed and had been sitting in the Court listening to other Crown witnesses. Defence counsel objected and claimed the Crown had not disclosed this witness. Ace was also a client of defence counsel and so defence counsel would not be able to cross-examine Ace. HELD: The Crown failed to provide proper disclosure to defence counsel, the non-disclosure had an adverse effect of the accused's ability to make full answer in defence and the appropriate remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call Ace as a witness.","The accused was charged with break and enters of homes and was denied involvement. After hearing evidence from the home owners, co-accused, and peace officers who investigated the incidents, the Crown advised the court of its intention to call one of the victims to the witness box. Defence counsel objected on this basis, arguing that the Crown had ambushed him and his client and that they should not be permitted to call this witness. The Crown counsel argued that the defence had not disclosed their intention to use the witness and that the witness was a client of Bendig's Law Office. HELD: 1)A stay of proceedings was out of the question. The accused's right to full answer and defence had been prejudiced only by not being told that Ace Carlos Whitecap would be a Crown witness. 2)The Crown's failure to disclose its decision to call the witness seriously damaged the accused's ability to effective representation with respect to the cross-examination of the witness. 3)The only remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call that witness. Stay of proceedings is out of question as the court must take into account all aspects of the failure to make full disclosure including the nature of the charge, delay, adjournments to date and at who's request, the extent of the evidence not disclosed and the extent to which defence counsel would have been able to take the appropriate steps to properly protect the interests of both Whitecap and Lathlin. 4)The accused's rights to full answers and defence were prejudiced by the Crown's non-disclosure. 5)The delay in proceedings will impact on the relief demand. A stay would be appropriate as the accused would have had to sit through the entire Crown case in order to be as effective as possible in the cross examination of this witness and any lawyer who might have taken over the case entirely in order be sure to protect the interest of both the accused and the defence. 6)The court found that it was not appropriate to refuse the Crown’s application. The court found the following: 1.A stay was not in order; requiring another lawyer to step in to cross-examine the witness would not be appropriate; 2.The accused’ s right to a full answer was prejudiced on a balance of probabilities; 3.The delay would have prejudiced or had an adverse effect on the accused”s ability to make complete answer in the trial; 4.A continuance of proceedings would be out of order"

The appeal, however, was not found to be of sufficient importance to the practice of law or the Court of Queen’s Bench to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal.

The confrontation between the accused and the complainant was one continuing episodic event and the complainant's actions were provoked by the accused.

The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","The accused, a young person with multiple fractures to his head and face, was sentenced to 24 months custody, followed by a period of probation with credit for pre-sentence detention and a letter of apology written by the victim.

HELD: A sentence of at least one year in custody followed by periods of probation and a pre sentence of eight months. The offender will be permanently disabled by the time he is sentenced. A period of custody was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A high sentence would allow the time frame required for the young person to stabilize and engage with support services prior to his release in the community. A lengthy custodial sentence would enable the time to spend in pre- sentence detention to stabilize, engage with and participate in programming for substance abuse, as recommended by Dr. Quinn and the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA).

In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed. Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision. The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case. The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.  4)There was no order as to costs as success was divided.","This appeal was taken under s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act.

As with all other fully enclosed shopping centres in Saskatoon, the assessor calculated MAF of 0.94 for the mall. 2) In this case, the appellant only raised two issues: 1) did the assessment Appeals Committee erred in law by concluding that functional obsolescence does not apply to an add-on type of construction or by finding that there must be an inability of an improvement to perform the function for which it is used; or 2) in concluding that this was not the ground for the decision. 3) Did the Assessor erred by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the assessment manual in determining the market adjustment Factor for the appellant properties by using a single sale to calculate the market adjust factor? Each of the issues dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon. Exactly the same reasoning applies in this case. 4) The appeal must be allowed on a same basis in respect to the grounds and same issues in the 'MALL' appeal."

Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question.

The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT. The applicants were charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana. They were scheduled for separate trials this fall before Judge and Jury. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two provisions of the warrant: a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance on each accused and a search warrant authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. A search warrant to search the residence of each accused was issued in April 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones. In general terms it is the position of the applicants that the authorization for the electronic surveillance should be set aside, and as information obtained from the Electronic Surveillance was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant and the subsequent search warrant both of these warrants should also be set Aside on the basis they are derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful. The granting of leave to cross-examine is justified in these circumstances in order to prevent an abuse of what is essentially a ruling on the admissibility of evidence on a Charter hearing. The granted leave to examine should be left to the exercise of the trial judge. Leave must be obtained to cross examine. The discretion of the preliminary inquiry judge should not be interfered with on appeal except in cases in which it has not been judicially exercised. The following are grounds for the granting of the leave to re-examined: 1) the authorization was set aside for electronic monitoring in respect of offences contrary to s. (trafficking or possession for the purpose of trafficking), (cultivation), and 19.2 (laundering proceeds) of the Narcotic Control Act and 'any conspiracy, or attempt to commit, or being an accessory after the fact, or any counselling, procuring or inciting in relation to such offences; 2) the applicant's counsel was advised that the applicant had a large marihua grow operation on a rural property and that police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises during the search; 3) the Crown did not consider the existence of a third provision in the warrant which prohibited the viewing of any third-party content on the Internet, and 4) there was no evidence that the third provision, which was alleged to have been unlawful, could be accessed by the applicant. The Crown relied on the British Columbia Court of Appeal decision of R. v. West (1998), 12 C.R. (5th) 106. Preliminary Inquiry Evidence"
9_2007skqb98.txt,"The appellants were found guilty of breaching a rural municipal bylaw which provides 'That no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned Hamlet [sic].' There were four grounds of appeal: 1) an application to admit new evidence on appeal; 2) a constitutional challenge seeking a declaration that the bylaw was ultra vires for uncertainty; 3) the significance of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw; and 4) the meaning of the word 'livestock' in the bylaw. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) New evidence will not be admitted on an appeal if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial. Further, new evidence will be admitted only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial. Neither of these requirements is met. 2) The constitutional challenge is not properly before the Court as notice is required when the constitutionality of a bylaw is impugned. In any event, the uncertainty on which the appellants rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist. 3) The appellants misunderstand the use of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw. 4) Whatever definition of 'livestock' is used, the definition always includes cattle.","At a June 2, 2006 trial in Provincial Court, the appellants were found guilty of breaching a bylaw of the Rural Municipality of Vanscoy No.345. The trial justice convicted them of breaching Bylaw 2-1995, which provides that no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned Hamlet. The appellants did not lead evidence at trial. They did not dispute that they were keeping cattle on their property. Their defence related to points of law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants had not given notice under The Constitutional Questions Act. Notice is required when the constitutionality of bylaw is questioned. The constitutional question is not properly before me. 2)The uncertainty suggested by the appellant's evidence did not exist. Under the current regime, no livestock is permitted in the district. Cattle are livestock, and so cattle are not permitted in that district. The three bylaws tendered by the appellant do not bear upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue at the trial. The zoning bylaw refers to an operation relating to keeping livestock. The amendments to the bylaw address other topics. 3)It is not proper to refer to a particular bylaw as a 'divisions zoned hamlet' since the designation of hamlet does not refer to hamlet. To the extent that the zoning bylaws referred to an 'opecious' subdivision, 'livestock' includes cattle. 4)The bylaw referred to a 'livable' community, not a 'hamlet'. The appellant did not claim that cattle were permitted on the property. The bylaw purports to be an amendment to Bylaws 1 and 2-1993. 5)Cattle were livestock and so livestock were not permitted. 6)In the absence of a specific definition of livestock, the word is uncertain and can be defined so broadly as to be either meaningless or unenforceable. The uncertainty on the part of the appellant's rely in attacking the bylaws does not exist, as they discuss in the balance of this decision. 7)Application to admit new evidence dismissed. The evidence will not be admitted on appeal if it bears upon a pivotal issue in the trial, as R. v. Palmer (1979), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, or 'Domestic animals generally' as defined by the Saskatchewan Government Relations and Aboriginal Affairs to the rural municipality. 8)Whether cattle are livestock"
c_2001nsfc8.txt,"This was a hearing to determine the proper venue for a custody hearing. The parties resided together in 1991 and 1992 in the Territory of Nunavut. The first language of the respondent mother and the child is Inuktitut.

This arrangement was not to exceed one year unless agreed to by the mother. Determining that the courts in both Nunavut and Nova Scotia have jurisdiction to deal with the issue of custody, that it was in the best interests of the child to remain in Nova Scotia and for the custody hearing to be held in Nova Scotia.","This was an application for custody of the child. The mother had been unable to obtain translation services in Nova Scotia and the father had moved away from Nunavut before he knew the mother was pregnant. Due to the unavailability of this service, the mother had to spend considerable time with her children. In November 1999, the court issued an order that it would take jurisdiction and hear the application under S. 18 of the Family Maintenance Act. There had been an unreasonable period of time from the date of the application to the decision of the court. The problem had been with the mother's unwillingness to provide assistance and the assistance of an Inuit translator. The father had sought custody since the beginning of the year and had convinced the mother that she was not giving up her parental rights. Access was granted to the father every summer from the second week in July until September until October and again in November until December 2001. The access was to take place in the year 2001. Given the financial situation of the mother and the difficulty in obtaining a translator in Nova Scotia, the Court was of the opinion that the current status quo was not in the child's best interests."

8_2009nssc351.txt,"The action, originally filed in 2000, concerned allegations of breach of - fiduciary duty, trust, industry regulations/standards, contract; and claims of negligence and malpractice. These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant. The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years. The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars. There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years). While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant. There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay. After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here. On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice. There is a significant documentary record of the transactions. The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner. The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time. While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice. Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","The plaintiffs filed an Originating Notice and Statement of Claim in 2000. They claimed that the defendant RBC caused them to suffer losses on investments. They alleged that RBC covered the stock issues of the two companies despite their possession being not communicated to the plaintiffs. RBC denied any wrongdoing by it or its solicitor. The plaintiffs sought damages for breach of a fiduciary duty, breach of trust, and breach of industry regulations and standards, and for negligence and professional malpractice. In dismissing the action, that the delay was entirely due to the negligence of RBC's solicitor and, in particular, that R. O'Neill engaged in unauthorized or discretionary trading in the accounts, claiming that the purchases were inconsistent with the plaintiffs' investment objectives. R.BC acquiesced to a slow tempo of litigation and the plaintiffs claim damages for the delay of over 20 years. Ruled out in Savoie v. Chipman, J.A., which held that there was an understanding that the matter would not proceed until such time as the plaintiffs intended to retain new counsel, RBC admitted that it could have compelled Mr. O’Neill to attend an examination while they did not have his contact information. R&D filed by RBC and its solicitor were dismissed in 2008. The Court found that the plaintiffs were responsible for a considerable period of delay, which was inordinate and inexcusable. The presence or absence of these defendants may be relevant in determining whether the delay is classified as inordinate."

2009skqb445.txt,"The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances. The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1) There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence. In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos. The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v.

2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have him declared a dangerous offender. The accused was convicted of assaulting a peace officer. The offence was a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The offences were violent and his conduct endangered or was likely to endanger the life or safety of the officer. HELD: The accused is ineligible for a conditional sentence order. The Court found that given the accused’s record of 58 Criminal Code convictions and the fact that he had been cornered by two police officers and had been given a warning that he was going to be killed, the court found that the accused exhibited such indifference to the officer that an order should not be made."
e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. HELD: 1) In reviewing the evidence that was before the learned trial judge, the judge could not have reasonably reached the conclusion he did, the evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated. Impatient, probably, but not frustrated. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be opened nor for the police to take any statements or require the detainee to participate in any potentially incriminating process until he has had that reasonable opportunity to contact counsel. This additional informational obligation on police will be triggered once a detainee has asserted his right to counsel and the obligation on the part of the police during this time to refrain from having them participate in the process that would incriminate him.  2) The respondent was correctly advised that he had no right to contact a lawyer once he changed his mind about seeking legal advice. The Crown provided unequivocal warning to the police that the accused would not be permitted to contact one. The accused was correctly informed that the Crown had a waiver of the right to consult with a lawyer on a case-by-case basis and the accused had not rebutted the Crown's assertion that he was incapable of providing counsel. 3) The Crown's appeal was allowed on the basis that the trial judge erred in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights with respect to access to legal counsel. 4) The lack of Prosper warning does not mean the respondent gave an unequivocal waiver. The burden of establishing that he gave the wrong signal is on the Crown, who must be unequivocal in their analyses of the facts in this case, and the court must examine the evidence to determine whether the Crown has met the burden to establish that the Respondent gave an unambiguous waiver. 5) The failure of the Crown to disclose the existence and availability of the applicable systems of duty counsel and Legal Aid in that jurisdiction was a serious breach of that Charter right. The trial judge made unequivocal and unequivocal analyses of this waiver and the reasons for his decision to not disclose it to the accused. The appeal is remitted back to the learned trail judge for continuation of the case."

The issue was whether the evidence of the Crown was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court did not know who to believe and he was not guilty of the offence of common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. Although the accused had walked fast because he was angry with the complainant and had made some comments that he would stab or hit the complainant's father, there were no other witnesses in the room at the time. The court found nothing from any of the witnesses who testified that undermined credibility. The evidence should be regarded as having less value, sufficient to support the conviction of the accused."
d_2002skqb80.txt,"The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion.","The applicant Credit Union loaned the respondent $37,700 upon a security of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer. The respondent's wife had apparently been the person who used the vehicle under the registration agreement but she was never the registered owner of the vehicle until she acquired it from her husband's estate. Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made the respondent aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period between September 11, 2001, to November 14, 2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The wife sought to defeat the securityinterest upon the ground that she was at all times the real owner of her vehicle, had made the payments and was always in possession of it. HELD: 1)The claim of Credit Union was enforceable as against the conflicting claim of the wife.  2)In the special circumstances the Court declined to order costs of either motion."
b_2016skqb297.txt,"HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made. The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.",HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that were not addressed that: 1) the petitioner had not provided factual evidence as background; 2) the respondent had not been properly vetted; and 3) there was no evidence that he had masturbated in the presence of the children. The evidence did not support the conclusion that the petitioner's allegations of sexual abuse were unreliable; and 4) there were no established circumstances upon which the respondent could have rebutted the presumption that he was the only person who could have given evidence that the allegations were unreliable and that there was a risk of harm.

While not all of the witnesses will be ascertained quickly, the important ones can be, which is all that Rule 6.03(5)(a) requires. The hearing should be predictable in scope and length and ready to be heard within months. The issues are straightforward. The only thing that would cause delay is the intended counterclaim.","Applicants, Peter Boone and Loren Bough, seek to convert some $2.5 million of debentures issued by the respondent to Medusa Medical Technologies Inc. The debentureures have matured and Medusa has failed to pay the principal and interest amounts owing. Boone and Bough want to convert the application to an action. They seek to have it converted into an action by the Court. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) Rule 6.03(4) provides a presumption in favour of an application if the substantive rights asserted by the parties are breached and the application cannot proceed under the present circumstances. 2) The application can be heard in months rather than years. The issue that will necessarily drag the proceedings to years is the intended counterclaim by Medusa for as yet undeterminable, possible or potential economic losses allegedly caused by the Respondent's enforcement application. 3) The Court reviewed all of the evidence presented, the applicable Civil Procedure Rules, the jurisprudence referred to by counsel for the parties and the able and helpful submissions by the court. 4) Rule 7.02(3) provides other circumstances to be considered. The application could proceed primarily by way of affidavit evidence and cross examination and possibly limited direct testimony. The issues were very straight forward and the hearing should be of predictable length. The presumption outlined in Rule 7 would also apply."

Two health care institutions, one residential lodge and one hospital, each of whose employees were represented by a different union, were to be integrated into one new institution, this Centre. This was undisputed that the long term intent was this integration. The application to the Board, by the appellant C.U.P.E., to determine whether it represented a majority of the employees, was made under s. 37 of The Trade Union Act and on an application to quash, the first question to be asked by the reviewing court is whether the interpretation is patently unreasonable. To jump immediately to an analysis in the facts premised on a different interpretation does not serve. It does not, as noted, apply to other areas of the law, such as financing, conveyance of property or insurance, where a more precise and predictable delineation of the moment of transfer may be appropriate. The Board is interpreting s.37 for the purposes of labour law alone. This is its function. To emphasize facts of lesser traditional legal significance in the Board's judgment and those of more concrete significance in parallel areas begs the real question. The authorities make it clear that it is within the purview of the Board to interpret s.38 and on application to revoke the order sought, the very first question is whether it is pathetically unreasonable. In the circumstances we have looked at the interpretation of s.40 and cannot in the circumstances find it to be patently unreasonably unreasonable.

The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012. The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew. Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved. This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial? HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act. With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action. As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it. Since the parties had given notice that they wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case, the Court ordered that the deponents be produced for the purpose of cross-examination.","FIAT: The plaintiffs commenced their statement of claim under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Saskatchewan on April 27, 2009. Their claim is with respect to a construction residential contract of purchase and sale. The plaintiffs are claiming the return of their deposit of $25,000 and the costs of plans prepared for them at cost of $3,533.25. The defendant corporation filed a statement of defence on September 17, 2009 denying the plaintiffs' claim. In February 2012, counsel for the plaintiffs withdrew and asked for an adjournment of the simplified trial. At that time, Orion Morgan, president of the defendant corporation, advised counsel/the plaintiffs and the Court that his corporation had recently been dissolved. That was later confirmed when a certificate of dissolution was filed with the Court.

6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed.

After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased the property in 1999. It was then that she discovered that a moisture pocket in the master bedroom had been discovered. She also discovered that pine shakes were in the attic. Water had entered through a dormer window in the house. The plaintiff sued the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the home. She claimed aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against the husband and wife for failure to obtain a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. The parties were to enter into a confidential agreement to have the documents reviewed. The documents were to be produced to the plaintiff so that she could obtain a copy of the PCDS.

He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company (STC). The plaintiff had been dismissed from his position as president and chief executive officer of the corporation. STC awarded damages in the amount of $165,000. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as were either earned or should have beenearned in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum; and third, that all of the plaintiff's Crown corporation service had been for one year rather than three, or two instead of five or even ten.

d_2006nsca124.txt,"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered.

By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent, who challenged the validity of a search warrant issued by the judge who excluded evidence obtained in the search of her home. The Crown alleged the judge erred in law by failing to apply the proper standard of review. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the judge misapplied the standard upon which he was to review the decision. The court found the warrant was quashed in error. The warrant had been valid, the search was lawful and there was no allegation that it was otherwise unreasonable. However, the evidence obtained as a result of the search had been wrongly excluded and the result would not necessarily have been the same. The appeal court found that even had the warrant been quashed, the findings of the FLIR testing and the observations about the basement were insufficient to overcome the weaknesses in the source's information. Therefore, the trial judge substituted his view of the law with that of the issuing judge."
d_2005nssc322.txt,"The plaintiff, who was injured in a rear-end motor vehicle accident, applied for summary judgment and an interim payment of damages. Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.","The plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle at the time of the accident when she was struck from behind by the defendant. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence that there were no brake lights on the defendant's vehicle, it would still be a haphazard guess to assess whether any injuries sustained were not minor injuries. The plaintiff also alleged that the tail lights were working. Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have enough care or control of his vehicle and consequently the collision occurred. The evidence submitted by way of affidavits and material attached to the defendant’s affidavits did not disclose the existence of an actual or probable defence and could not fend off an application for summary judgement."
e_2000skqb515.txt,"The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.",The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln. Fair was convicted of trafficking in marihuana and possession for the purpose of trafficking. Brooks applied for relief from forfeiture pursuant to ss. 20(4) and 21(4). Brooks did not dispute the assertion by the Crown that the Lincoln was within the definition of 'offence-related property'. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)Section 16(3) provides the court with the authority to make an order of relief from forfeiting unless it is satisfied that the accused is innocent of any complicity or that she exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied the property was not likely to have been used in the commission of the offence. 2)Section 20(3)(g) provides for the court to make the order of forfeiture pursuant s. 19(3). The Crown did not prove either beyond reasonable doubt or on balance of probabilities that there was any complicity in the designated substance offence nor that it was conducted with reasonable care. 3)The affidavit deposed that Brooks loaded our luggage in to the Lincoln at hotel in Calgary. It was not their first overnight stay. 4)Compromised testimony of the RCMP officer who testified at trial did not rebut the Crown's assertion that the vehicle was used to facilitate the offence of which it was convicted. 5)The court was unable to conclude that Brooks 'appeared innocent of all complicity' in the offence for which it is alleged that she was convicted and exercised all reasonably care to avoid forfeiture. The evidence at trial was that she had not seen any of the illegal drugs in the vehicle nor had she consented to them being in the possession of her co-accused. 6)Statutes of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada have been interpreted to mean that a person who is charged with a designated substance offences is entitled to forfeiture pursuantto s.16(1).

He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","The father, who was living with his mother, was ordered to pay maintenance for his son pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act. The mother had previously been a dependent child under the Family Maintenance Act. At the time of the accident, the father had graduated from high school and was working at two part-time jobs. He had made some progress but was unable to withdraw from the parent's charge. The father now moved in with the mother and was paying support at the rate set out in the Guidelines. At issue was the child's future ability to 'withdraw from parental charge' was unknown. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs of $2,000 payable by the father to the mother. 1)There was no evidentiary basis upon which the judge could conclude that the Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' and therefore depart from it.  2)The evidence was not persuaded that the judge erred in concluding that the child had not withdrawn and was unable, in his intention, to further his education.

Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s. 15(1), 24(1) and 52(1)(b) of the Charter of Rights for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the rights of the applicant as guaranteed under s15 and s7 of the charter. The applicant, a former faculty member, claimed retroactive benefits and sought the reinstatement of him as full-time members of the faculty. The respondent denied the application, and, in turn, refused to pay the applicants all compensation due to them as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement. Allowing the application and ordering the payment of all of the costs of the proceeding, that the Charter does not apply to private activity, except in cases where a discriminatory act is committed by legislative action and the jurisdiction concerned does not have an overriding clause in its Human Rights Act. This would be so. This was an attempt to short-circuit the anticipated lengthy process under the Nova Scotia Human rights Act by calling the Charter into play. In this case, the government did not control the core functions of the University, including its relations with staff."

The Court found that it would be in the best interests of the children to move from the primary care of the mother to the grandmother's home and that reasonable and liberal access was granted to the children. As the mother and father had separated, the father had access only intermittently. The grandparents were unable to reach an agreement regarding the ongoing parenting arrangement for the children and the father was to pay child support for the rest of his life.

The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","The respondent SGI terminated the plaintiff's income replacement benefits pursuant to s.185 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The plaintiff had been injured in a motor vehicle accident and received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis that he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. After the accident, the plaintiff temporarily disabled himself and underwent physiotherapy at a physiotherapy clinic in Yorkton. He applied to SGI for an order setting aside the termination. HELD: SGI's termination was appropriate. SGI shall pay the plaintiff the difference, if any, between the amount paid to the plaintiff for the period September 24 to October 23, 1997 and the amount required to be paid pursuant to the judgment for the time September 24/October 23/24, 1997.  1)SGI was not entitled to terminate the benefits under s. 185(d), (e), (f) or (g) of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations as the plaintiff was no longer able to work full time in Alberta. 2)The plaintiff was diagnosed with a relapse of depression and anxiety. 3)The court was not prepared to find that the plaintiff caused his early discharge from the Yorkton Physiotherapy Secondary Treatment Centre or failed, without valid reason, to fail his scheduled assessment in Wascana."
c_2007nsca4.txt,"The appellants applied for leave to amend their notice of appeal in regard to an order requiring them to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications.

Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make. The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","The appellants sought leave to amend their notice of appeal. Leave was required because the underlying proceeding was an application for leave to appeal and, if granted, an appeal from an order requiring the appellants to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications in which they will be the moving parties.

4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 1,200 postings on the website, which included 11 stories that were the subject of the charge. The site encouraged stories, and the defendant encouraged others to submit stories. The Defendant stated he did not own a computer at the time he engaged in the activity and that he was more of a voyeur than actively sexual with girls. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years and a half year of counselling with a mental health nurse. A conditional sentence would not be a fit sentence on the facts as the defendant had no criminal record and was serving the social purpose of looking after his ailing mother who lived on an isolated acreage and who will also be punished if he is incarcerated. A sentence of 10 years imprisonment was imposed."
7_2011skpc143.txt,"The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals. The issue was whether the claims should be issued. HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","The court refused to issue summonses to the defendant in a claim for $10,000 in damages. The defendant argued that the court had refused to grant the summons on the basis that it was a violation of s. 7(4) of The Small Claims Act. In issue was whether or not the defendant should be issued a summons pursuant to s. 57.1 of the Act. The applicant had submitted 18 claims for issuing to the court on behalf of the claimants. The judge had refused, in response to a letter from the defendant, to issue a Supplementary Interim Ruling, which set out the issues for the court to decide on. The Supplementary Investigation Ruling was dated August 15, 2011 and was reproduced in full in its entirety. The issues raised by the claims were declaratory in nature, and outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court, which would be a time for a hearing."

In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT. The respondent sought an order for interim spousal support. HELD: The Court concluded that relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should not take the form of spousAL support. The petitioner did not have the means to make the indicated payments. The Court ordered the husband to receive half of the value of the matrimonial property valued at $488,040. The other half should be paid to the petitioner by monthly payments in the amount of $500. The court ordered the wife to choose the alternative and the husband should receive the other half. In the alternative the wife should receive a portion of the income from the sale of the farm land rather than the husband's rental income. The husband's obligation to pay out half of his income should be taken into account. The wife's obligation should be borne by the husband in the alternative, in which case it should be the sum of $10,000, which should commence at the end of the month and be deducted from the total monthly income of $3,474.33. The balance of $6,000 should be given to the husband with monthly payments of $1,111.67 if he is required to pay an additional $500 month. The $5,000 awarded to the wife for child support should be divided equally. The remaining monies should be directed towards the husband who can find a way to obtain a mortgage on a farm land which he already owned and the costs of legal fees would increase."

2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","The parties, who were together for seven years, were permanently separated. Now, the petitioner seeks access to their daughter from an earlier relationship. That child is from an 11 year old. The petitioner and the respondent live together in a five-bedroom home. It would appear that the relationship between the parties spanned the years 2000 to 2007. They moved at the same time, bringing with him his two daughters. The parties had been married for four years. HELD: 1) The petitioner has already had to contend with multiple parents and multiple siblings. The confusion that this has caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of the petitioner. 2) The respondent demonstrated he is a person of sufficient interest with respect to the child. He did not need to establish that he falls within the category of persons having a'sufficient interest' to bring this application. Because of the familial relationship among the parties and the amount of time that the petitioner allowed to elapse before commencing his petition, access is not granted to the respondent. 3) The relationship spanned five years, commencing when the petitioner was barely a toddler. Over those years, the relationship span span from time to time. The respondent provided care for the child, participated in activities with the school and was intermittently involved in their lives. 4) In this case, the respondent demonstrated that he was a person with sufficient interest. He demonstrated he had, and has, the same status as a parent. The presumption that it is in the petitioner's best interests that she have access to him is more consequence to the legal position that the respondent has argued than to the fact that he has a high risk of harm. 5) The Court must consider a variety of factors including the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and quality of the relationship with the person who is seeking access, how the relationship was represented to the world and whether the applicant provided financially for the petitioner in the circumstances of this case."
e_2011skqb444.txt,"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and common assault. The Court found that the accused’s actions were done in self-defence. The court found that both the accused and the two alleged victims were inmates at the prison and that their actions were motivated by mutual respect and protection. The three elements of s. 34(2) have been established: 1) the subjective perception of the situation is subjective; 2) the accused reasonably believed that the assault was going to happen; and 3) that he believed on reasonable grounds that it did. The accused had a jacket on which he was sitting when the shot was fired.

5_1995canlii4187.txt,"This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).","The appellant contended the trial judge erred in law by applying the doctrine of recent possession mainly because there was no evidence that he was in recent possession of the stolen Chevrolet Blazer. Dismissing the appeal, that although the evidence was circumstantial, the facts he found to be proved led to no other reasonable inference than the guilt of the appellant. The appellant ran from the vehicle and made the tracks in the snow which were followed by the police. He said the imprint found in the tracks was consistent with his findings of fact. The appeal was dismissed."
