Judge applied the test that the justice of the peace `must be satisfied on reasonable grounds.' Substantial compliance found and warrant upheld.,"The respondent, a justice of the peace, issued a search warrant to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery. The applicants sought an order quashing the warrant on the grounds that the said search warrant was unlawfully and invalidly issued in excess of the jurisdiction of the Respondent for the following reasons: (1) the sole ground upon which the Information was based is hearsay information from a confidential source and no details are provided in support of the informant's opinion or conclusion that such information is reliable; and (2) no reliance could have been placed thereon by the Respondente in determining whether reasonable and probable grounds existed for the issuance of the warrant."
1990canlii2449.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance. The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child. Allowing the appeal, that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act. Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible. It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children. In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born. The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","An unmarried, pregnant, 16 year old applied to the Social Services Department of the City of Halifax for municipal social assistance. She was found to be in need of support as an expectant mother. The applicant's stepfather, who was living with and being supported by her parents, was denied the application. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the Social Planning Department policy in place at the time of her application was not mandatory but rather discretionary. The respondent's stepdad was prepared to provide financial assistance if the applicant was unable to obtain employment, or who was not economically independent. The decision of the Social Security Appeal Board dismissing the appellant's application for certiorari to quash the decision of that board did not lead to an error of law."
1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The first mortgagee to the project, the second mortgagee, had received a number of irrevocable letters of direction which he acknowledged required him to pay the mortgage brokerage and architectural fees from the two mortgage brokers. The project was financially tight from the very beginning. Several months later, the first mortgageee, the current second mortgageee (the second mortgageeed), indicated willingness to inject more money into the project but that the first bank demanded that his contributions be paid in a particular manner and that he broke the undertaking contained in that letter. In early 1987, the third mortgagee (the first mortgageeed) requested that his fees from Dufferin and Colchester and Goguen be paid off on the signature of certain individuals only. In the meantime, the plaintiff suppliers and creditors began to notice signs of trouble. In one of the meetings, the president of the first real estate development company (the project) suggested that he should retain separate legal counsel to deal with the second mortgagese problem and the creditor's compounding problem. The second mortgageevs (the current mortgagee and the second property), having received significant amounts of mortgage advances, had postponed payment of the second draw by the first defendant until the end of March 1987. The plaintiff's claim was dismissed as not having established a breach of trust. The irrevocables of the president's letter acknowledging the mortgage advances had been paid but without specifying that they were disbursements. The president's handwritten notes also testify that he was aware of the mortgagee's failure to comply with his written directions and that the second defendant had said that he would 'go to the trouble of disbursement of the mortgages'. The documents also testify to an altercation between the president and his solicitor at the first meeting. The two lawyers were involved in a verbal altercation and the plaintiff was charged with disburseement of the remaining mortgage advances. The first defendant was granted a share of the profits from the mortgage draws and the subsequent drawings were also disburseable. The plaintiffs sued for breach of confidence and negligent misrepresentation. The defendant was found liable for the disburseements made to the plaintiff. The court dismissed the claim under breach of trusting. Any claim under a breach is not allowed."
1994canlii5055.txt,FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel. The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place. He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.,"The accused applied for a review of theterms of his judicial interim release. He and his counsel consented to a judicial interim released order containing certain terms. The accused sought an amendment by adding the phrase'regarding Sgt. Brian Dueck or Carol Bunko-Ruys'. HELD: The application was denied and the existing order stood. The picketing prohibition term imposed by the justice with the consent of the accused was reasonably constituted as a condition of his release from custody. But for this condition the justice might well have ordered that the accused be detained in custody on the ground that there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit a criminal offence if he were not prohibited from picketing prior to his trial.  1)The Court was satisfied in the circumstances and nature of the case that the picketing prohibited term imposed was reasonably justified as acondition of the release of the the accused from custody and that there would not have been a substantial risk that he committed a criminal offense or aninterference with the administration of justice. 2)If the amendment wasgranted as sought by the accused, there still remained a substantial chance he would committed a crime or an error in committing an offence or an interference with the justice. 3)The application was granted the privilege to review the terms of the judicial interim re-release."
1995canlii6138.txt,FIAT The Defendants were consulted by the Plaintiff and her mother 11 years earlier with respect to commencing an action for personal injuries arising out of a motor vehicle accident. The Plaintiff was only 12 at the time. No action was commenced with the result that the original action was now statute-barred. She waited 5 years after she attained the age of majority before taking this action against the Defendants. The Defendants applied to stay the action on the basis that they had never been retained. HELD: Application dismissed. Infants with bona fide causes are privileged suitors. An infant 'should not be visited with the sins of the next friends and litigation guardians who preceded him/her in the same action'.,"FIAT. The applicants, having destroyed their files, the death of the plaintiff's mother and the diminution of memories over a period of 11 years were partners in the practice of law. HELD: The application was dismissed but costs were to be paid to the trial judge. 1)The decision did not recognize the contingent element involved in the situation of an infant plaintiff. The fact that the plaintiff had not explained why she waited for five years after she attained majority before consulting counsel, except to say that she did not believe she could do anything as result of the original advice she and her mother received from the judge, was a factor that must be weighed against the applicants. 2)The plaintiff's father was not involved. He was unaware the plaintiff continued the firm's involvement."
1996canlii5602.txt,"The respondent pled guilty in provincial court to a charge of break, enter and theft for breaking into his neighbour's house and removing lingerie from a chest of drawers in the master bedroom.. He was sentenced to pay a fine of $2,500 or 50 days in default, plus a victim fine surcharge of $250 and three years probation. The terms of the probation order included a direction that the respondent pay restitution to the victims in the amount of $300, that he not have contact with the victims and that he continue treatment with his psychiatrist. The Crown appealed the sentence, alleging that it inadequately reflected the element of deterrence. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge considered the correct principles of sentencing . This was a unique case where it was apparent that the respondent did not commit the offence for the usual reasons and that he required psychiatric treatment.","This was an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed by a Provincial Court judge for a break, enter and theft charge to which the respondent pled guilty. The respondent was sentenced to pay a fine of $2,500 or 50 days in default, plus a victim fine surcharge of $250 and three years probation. The Crown sought to have the sentence retroactive to June 1995. The sentencing judge, however, disagreed with the Crown's argument that the sentence should be varied only if he was satisfied that it was clearly excessive or inadequate in relation to the offence proven or to the record of the accused. The trial judge considered the correct principles of sentencing in this unique case. It is apparent the respondent did not commit this break for the usual reasons and he was able to continue his sessions with his psychiatrist."
1996canlii6754.txt,"A radio station reported that a 12 year old girl was dragged and sexually assaulted behind a roller rink or between the rink and a store. The owner of the rink claimed financial compensation for a subsequent decline in his business which he alleged was a direct result of the broadcast. The script and reel had been destroyed and it was impossible to recreate exactly what was aired. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing that the defendant published was false, malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. 2)The station followed the CRTC Regulations and was exonerated entirely by its controlling body. The defendant published the news it received from the police, a proven reliable source. 3)Nothing pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff's roller rink operation. The business was on a down side at the time. The assault occurring where it did was not the fault of either party. If it had a bearing on the immediate attendance figure it was minimal and the plaintiff did no promotion whatsoever to increase attendance.","The plaintiff was the announcer for a radio newscast. The plaintiff's employer was the owner of a family corporation and the defendant's radio station reported on the sexual assault. The defendant refused to broadcast the newscasts, saying it was an attempt to ""disrupt"" the public's attention. An eight-week period was observed in which attendance was down for eight weeks. The attendance was recorded for eight-weeks. The company's general manager was the general manager and his employees were first and foremost shareholders. The general manager advised that the company's business was on a down note and that he was not happy that the name of his business had been connected to the sexual assaults. The employees were then encouraged to work hard and stay in the rink. The newscaster was not only accurate but also accurate in describing the area and the people who worked there. The audience was not disinterested in the report but were more interested in the facts."
1997canlii786.txt,"The parties executed a separation agreement that resolved all matters corollary to their divorce and the Matrimonial Property Act. The respondent husband proceeded with an uncontested divorce. The appellant wife did not oppose the proceeding. She subsequently appealed the corollary relief judgment on the grounds that the underlying separation agreement is unconscionable and unduly harsh. She sought to introduce fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that even with the new evidence, the appellant still failed to demonstrate an adequate excuse for not responding to the divorce proceeding. There was no evidence that the appellant did not understand her legal entitlement at the time the agreements were signed, or that she did not appreciate that a divorce proceeding had been commenced.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children, one of whom was born in the wife's custody and one who was living in the husband's basement. The parties separated in 1996 and the wife moved into the basement of the matrimonial home with the respondent. She was diagnosed as suffering from depression at the time of the separation and had been on medication for depression. The wife had been advised by her doctor that she should take medication for the depression. She underwent an emergency treatment and was on medication before signing the agreement. She moved into this basement apartment with the child when the parties separated. The appellant, now aged 40, alleged that she was suffering from lingering depression and that she entered into an improvident agreement to alleviate the pain of the marriage in order to obtain custody. The husband and wife had obtained separation insurance from the mother's previous common law spouse and had obtained a separation agreement which provided for joint custody of the children. The mother and child had been together for six months prior to the marriage. The separation agreement was based upon a common law arrangement and was subject to a nominal fee of $50 per month. The agreement was subsequently amended to provide for an additional fee of 50 per month until the wife received independent legal advice. The applicant applied to have the agreement set aside on the grounds that the underlying separation agreement is unconscionable and unduly harsh. Application to admit fresh evidence dismissed; the test for admission of fresh evidence in a custody proceeding is not applicable in any circumstances and the test applied here should not have been applicable in the circumstances where the parties had entered into a settlement agreement. Where legal action has been settled and the settlement has formed the basis of a court order, a party should not be permitted to resile from that bargain save in exceptional circumstances. The test for the admission of new evidence in an appeal is not a straightforward one but the Court has the opportunity to consider the question of fresh information against the whole background of the case and all the other evidence in the case."
1997canlii9636.txt,The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.130 of the Land Titles Act and s.56 of the Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act for an order relieving the estate from payment of maintenance ordered in 1972. The respondent objected to the application being brought on behalf of the estate as Olson was neither executrix nor a beneficiary under the Will. The Will had not been admitted to probate. The respondent had divorced testator in 1972 and was granted child support of $60 per month and monthly spousal support of $40. The applicant who cohabited with the deceased since 1978 transferred her home to him in 1980 as joint tenants and he transferred his two and one-half quarter sections of farm land to the applicant. The applicant suggested there was an agreement whereby the respondent lived rent free in the matrimonial home in lieu of support. The respondent received welfare to support herself and the children and had had no funds to pursue enforcement of the unpaid support payments. HELD: 1)The style of cause was amended to show Olson as applicant. She was an interested party within the meaning of s.56 of the EMOA and entitled to bring the application on her own behalf. The respondent was not misled and there was no prejudice. 2)The Land Titles Act was of no assistance to the applicant. The application was to be determined upon s.56 of the EMOA and whether it would be grossly unfair and inequitable to refuse the application. 3)The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge. There was no evidence presented either of consideration being paid nor of what became of the income generated by the land prior to the deceased's death.  4)A trial of an issue was ordered to determine what if any portion of the arrears should remain a charge upon the lands. Some of the evidence conflicted. Viva voce evidence should be heard.,"The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.130 of the Land titles Act S.S. c. L-5 and s.56 of The Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act (EMOA) for an order relieving the respondent Estate (the deceased) from payment of a maintenance order by Johnson J.(as he then was) on November 28, 1972. The decree gave the deceased custody of their two children who were then 10 and and child support of $60 per month. The applicant claimed she received welfare to support herself and the children until 1981. During these years she had no funds with which to hire a lawyer to enforce the support payments which were due to her. HELD: The application failed to be determined upon s. 56 of the EMOA. The question for resolution in whether it would be 'grossly unfair and inequitable' from the applicants perspective to refuse the application and whether such an order can be 'justified' in so far as the respondent is concerned was answered.  1)The applicant was awarded judgment respecting the previous maintenance order made against her. 2)The respondent was awarded spousal support of approximately $40 per month and child and child tax and arrears of taxes. 3)The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge.  4)The question for resolving in whether the section be 'grossly unfair' and inequious' from an applicants perspective is whether such a order can 'justify' in the so far back as the claimant is concerned. 5)The application failed because the respondent was an 'interested party' within the meaning of sec.56. The respondent is entitled to recover arrear of maintenance pursuant to the order of November 29, 1972 and to a right to discharge of the order pursuant pursuant to her right to a s.61 of the Manitoba Family Maintenance Act. 6)The arreary arreared must now be considered as vested debt owning by husband to wife subject to being divested only on its being shown that it would been grossly unfair, inequitable not to do so and also that such a divestment is justified having regard to the interests of the wife. 7)The court should hear evidence viva voce. order the trial of an issue. The deceased will assert her right pursuant to a prior order of $16,000. The application fails to be resolved upon s.(56 of the)EMOA."

The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity. He ruled, however, that they could rely on the presumption of accuracy, and placed an onus on the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge committed a fundamental error of law by ruling that when the Crown is forced to rely on the balance of the evidence, the accused must raise a reasonable doubt, a burden that clearly remains on the Crown.","This was an application for leave to appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court of Canada dismissing an appeal from the appellant's conviction under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code.

He stated that the readings were not consistent with the evidence of consumption given by the accused.

The terms of the settlement and the sum paid were not to be disclosed. Beyond the issue of privilege which was a complete answer to the request, revisiting that action was a more critical problem. The sum paid to settle the first action was not allocated to any head of damages so those issues would have to be transversed as well. 2)The applicant may introduce his prior medical records with respect to the 1985 accident subject to compliance with the usual rules as to notice and admissibility. 3)The statement of claim in that action could not be entered at this trial as it was not evidence.

The judge reserved his decision with respect to the hearing of the applicant's motion in conjunction with the proposed trial of the action.

The jury may be advised of the prior accident, the date of the accident, that proceedings were commenced in this Court, the dates of those proceedings and the accidentultimately was settled, and the action discontinued. The terms of the settlement should not be disclosed nor the sum paid to settle the applicant\'s claim. Beyond the issue of privilege, which in itself is a complete answer to the applicant request, is the more critical problem of revisiting that action.

Beyond privilege, the more important problem is revisiting the action which is a series of allegations made by the respondent against the prior defendant."
1998canlii13585.txt,FIAT. Exclusive possesson and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner in May 1998. At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home. Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home. He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98. In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15. HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court. No case law could be found in support of either party. It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.,"FIAT. The parties were married for over 25 years and were now senior citizens. The respondent sought an order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home. The court did not specify a date for the respondent to move from the matrononial home as it was hoped that satisfactory alternate arrangements could be made within reasonable time to avoid the potential of the respondent having to make an interim move to satisfy the time limit in a court order when his preferred accommodations might be available shortly thereafter. HELD: The respondent was granted exclusive possession. The matrimonial home was given to him. 1)The issue resolved around the interpretation of two conflicting rules regarding the execution of a judgment or an order of exclusive possession and the possession of matrimony. 2)Rule 15 was not activated nor was the service and filing of notice of appeal stayed. 3)All matters of this Court were directed to be prepared to re-examine the judgment and to make all applications to the Court of Appeal made pursuant to Rule 15 as amended. 4)The Court was also directed to make certain that all applications were directed strictly to the date the respondent had to move out of the home. 5)All applications should be directed to the court of appeal unless otherwise ordered. 6)The application of Rule 15 was never directed to a reapply nor was a notice of an appeal directed at the respondent. 7)The Rule 15 application was never to be re-directed nor was it directed to reapply unless the court had already decided otherwise. 8)All rules respecting the use of admissibility and correctness were to be adhered to. 9)The order for the exclusive possession was not stayed by the notice of appeals. 10)The provision that directions be given by the court in any event could not be interpreted to mean that all directions should be made in any circumstances other than the one made pursuant the judgment. 11)The matter was then scheduled to be heard in June 1998. In the meantime, notice of appealed was filed on behalf of Mike. On June 19, 1998, counsel for Mike took the position that with the filing the notice OF appeal, the court could still proceed to provide the requested directions. The issue resolves around the interpretive application of two subclauses (1) and (4) of Rule15 of the Courtof Appeal."

2008skpc160.txt,"The accused is charged with aggravated assault. A voir dire was held to determine whether the accused's s. 8, s. 9, s. 10(a) and s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault. Prior to his trial, the accused gave notice that he would be making an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under s. 8, 9, and 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter had been infringed and sought a remedy. The accused was arrested, charged with the offence, and detained at the police station. At the police detachment, the officer asked the accused if he was okay with being arrested, and the accused answered that he was. During the course of the examination and seizure, the officers found that the blood-like stains on his person and clothes with 'hemosticks' were positive for blood. The officer then put the accused in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. The defence did not call any witnesses on the voir dire. The initial arrest was lawful, was not terminated by the purported 'un-arrest', and continued throughout the search and seizure at the Police station. The continued detention after the purported “de facto” arrest constituted a de facto arrest. The Court was not in error in that finding. The concept of an 'un'-arrest' is novel one and its concept is novel. Neither Crown nor defence counsel cited any case authority dealing with that concept. The fact that the police deliberately decided not to arrest the accused, although they made it clear to him that he had been detained for investigation, his detention there including the 'processing', examination and and seizure amounted to a 'de facto' arrest. In the present case, the Court found that there was an actual, legal arrest at the commencement, not an actual investigative detention which was transformed into an arrest."
2011skpc153.txt,The accused was charged with dangerous driving. The evidence established that the accused was observed driving a black Mustang that accelerated quickly from a red light. The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.,The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a highway in a manner that was dangerous to the public contrary to s.249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1) The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The officer was stopped behind the accused when the driver of the vehicle was observed accelerating to a rate of speed that was not normal for him. 2) The accused's objectively dangerous conduct was a marked departure from the standard expected for reasonably prudent drivers. 3) The driving was a'marked departure' from the acceptable standard expected.

The applicant union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Rule 62.35, or as amicus currie pursuant to Rule 8.02, or alternatively as an intervener pursuant to Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1), and to bring an appeal from orders made by a Supreme Court judge in proceedings brought by the intended plaintiff against the intended defendants. Rejecting the applications, that a Court of Appeal judge sitting in chambers does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status or to join a person as a party to a proceeding. Furthermore, as the union was not a party to the original proceeding, and was not joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a Supreme Court judge, it does not have standing to file an appeal.","The union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1) and to bring an appeal from orders made in 1999 and 1999 regarding the interlocutory injunction against the defendants. The defendants had applied to be joined as an intervener pursuant to Rule 62.35 and Rule 8.06. The Union argued that the orders of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal were so different from those of the Judicature Act that they should be avoided. The court dismissed the application as a result of the Union's failure to make proper representations to the Court concerning the arguable issue of the existence of a 'labour dispute' within the meaning of s. 44 of the Act. It held that the defendants, who were not party to the action, were merely 'unnamed persons' who had no status to appear before the Court pursuant to the Rules."
2_2000skqb301.txt,"Plaintiff, as litigation guardian for his four daughters, alleged that the defendant, in breach of a trust, wrongfully retained $20,000 to which his daughters are entitled. Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account. Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter. The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters. HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had wrongfully, in breach of a trust, retained the sum of $20,000 to which his four daughters were entitled. The plaintiff had four children: Mabel, Brenda, Amanda, Jonathon and Jonathon. Mabel had told her that the money in the bank account was to be held for payment of debts of Mabel's estate, with the balance to be divided between the plaintiff's four children. Mandy had requested that the plaintiff endorse three cheques in blank for the benefit of the four granddaughters. The defendant had then died before Royal Trust Company had completed the instructions by transferring the funds to the credit of the annuity contract of Daisy McIntyre. The incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust and not merely to make a transfer. HELD: The plaintiff was dismissed as a party to the action.  1) An entirely different situation was revealed in McIntyre v. Royal Trust Co., 1946 CanLII 249. 2) Royal Trust did not have all of the share certificates in its possession. The deceased's husband died before the instructions were completed. The instructions were given to the plaintiff, who became the trustee for the four grandchildren. The court found that the latter had not given any consideration to either Royal Trust or Royal Trust. The trust was not validly created where there was mere intention to create trust, or voluntary agreement to do so, and the settlor himself contemplates some further act for the purpose of giving it completion. The trustees were volunteers not having given any undue consideration to Royal Trust and Royal Trust, who would create an equity in her favour."

The Jabours, the third parties who acquired title to the house, firmly bolted a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Abilities Council by anchor bolts in a concrete slab. The Jabours sold to the Kapronczais who in turn sold the property 2 years later to the respondent, San Diego, but made no mention about ownership of the wheelchair lift. The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift. San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty. Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land. It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty. The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs giving a claim for damages. The Provincial Court judge dismissed the claim against the third party, the Jabours, on the facts.","An appeal from a Provincial Court decision on a small claim. The claim concerned whether something affixed to realty is a fixture that passes with title to the realty. The court dismissed the claim against the respondents (third parties at trial), who had purchased a house with a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Saskatchewan Abilities Council for the use of their disabled foster child. The wheelchair lift ceased to operate a few months after the respondent acquired the property. The title was transferred to both the plaintiff and the third party, the Jabours. The third party claimed damages for the claim made by the respondent, Elsa San Diego. The second party claimed the property was being sold to the respondent San Diego, who claimed not to have been told about the Abilities Council's ownership of the wheelchair lift and to never have been informed of such. The trial judge did not accept Kapronczai's denial that he and Tania knew that the wheelchair lifted was not part of the real estate or was owned by the Abilities council. There was evidence on which the trial judge could find as he did. The appeal was dismissed both as it affects the plaintiff&the third party. The disability lift never became part of a realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it became part, and the intention was a prime factor in determining whether something that affixed thereto becomes a part of that realty, and its intention was to be a prime factors in determining if something affressed to the Realty becomes a Part of the Real Estate.

The Crown sought an order pursuant to s.238(2) of the Income Tax Act ordering him to make payment of the sum of $22,069.23 to the Receiver General. At the time the 12 guilty pleas were tendered and the fines imposed, there was a dispute between the Crown and the respondent regarding the implication of outstanding bankruptcy proceedings in relation to the issuance of s. 238(2). HELD: A subsection 238(1 compliance order falls within the definition of 'any fine, penalty, restitution order or other order similar in nature to a fine, price or restitution order imposed by a Court in respect of an offence...' The Crown's jurisdiction to make an order under s.239(2 of the ITA is unaffected by the bankruptcy proceedings and the certificate of discharge arising therefrom in respect to the respondent. The Court's jurisdiction was unaffected by bankruptcy proceedings as the Crown sought to establish an order of compliance pursuant to ss. 238 and 238(3) of The Income TaxAct. Such matters were unaffected by an order for discharge under that Act which, it was submitted, must be established prior to issuing a compliance order. Such Matters were unaffected because the Crown's ability to establish how the Crown expended information in the past to establish the information would be irrelevant in light of the facts and circumstances surrounding the offences. Such is not an incumbent position on the Crown to establish compliance under s241(2); the Court's ability, in light as the respondent has not expended information as to how the information was presented in the information and how the Information was used in light the Crown had not established how theInformation was used to infer how the relevant information was obtained.

Application dismissed; the accused had not met the onus on the balance of probabilities of establishing that the former Superintendent had relevant or material evidence to offer concerning the issues raised by the Charter motions.

The plaintiffs sought substantially increased costs on the basis that the defendant should have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial. Solicitor and client fees totaled over $21,000. Costs fixed at $10,000 plus disbursements; there was no obligation on the defendant to admit liability but considering the amount of legal fees incurred in relation to the amount recovered, it was appropriate to go outside the tariffs.","Counsel had been unable to agree on costs after a four day trial. The plaintiffs were successful in recovering the base amount claimed but did not succeed in their claims for aggravated and punitive damages. The defendant should have admitted liability sooner rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial. Costs should be substantially increased above the usual party and party costs because, as he contended, the defendant ought to have admitted responsibility sooner rather then forcing the plaintiff to trial, and the manner in which the proceeding was conducted set out the factors that the court may consider in fixing costs. The conduct of any party which tended to shorten or unnecessarily lengthen the duration of the proceeding, and any step in the proceeding which was improper, vexatious, prolix or unnecessary, should have been considered.

A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused was on duty in a marked police car when the vehicle struck the complainant. The complainant was crossing the street when the accused's vehicle rolled forward and collided with the complainant's vehicle. The issue to be determined was whether the Crown has proved that the accused drove without due notice and attention applying an objective test in assessing carelessness and whether the accused has then shown, on balance of probabilities, that he exercised due diligence in the context of the circumstances he encountered. HELD: The accused's action was found to be careless driving. The officer who was driving the vehicle was first asked if he could assist the complainant and then later advised him that he would sue the man who had just come out of Super Store. The vehicle rolled to a stop directly in front of the complainant, and the complainant crossed the street on foot directly in the defendant's vehicle, causing him to roll forward and strike the complainant in the hip. The defendant was found not guilty of the charge. 1) The officer's evidence that he did not touch the accelerator, and briefly took his foot off the brake, and then immediately reapplied the brake after seeing the complainant cross the street was accepted. The Crown suggested that the defendant had an oblique motive for thinking that the vehicle could slow down. The defence suggested that it was a Ford F150 with a speed limit of 25 km/h. 2) The actions of the accused were careless. The police officer who had to assist the plaintiff in the cross-walk were found to have been negligent. The Court was satisfied that the officer's actions in operating his vehicle on the road beside the complainant were careless and that his driving forward into the complainant was careless. 3) The accused did not appear to have thought that the motor vehicle he was driving was going to be too fast or too slow. The collision occurred at a cross- walk and the defendant crossed the road directly infront of the police vehicle. Given the nature of the incident and as an accident, the defendant was not only in the position to assist but also to assist and to have other police attend at the scene. The Accused's actions at the cross walk were careless as he was attempting to assist another officer in the task of identifying a person who had been so close to the complainant that he had to leave on his own.

HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","The accused was charged with being at large on her undertakings given to Justice or Judge and being bound to comply with conditions including that she abstain from all use, consumption and possession of alcohol and that she was not impaired by alcohol at the time she made the demand. The accused testified that she knew the alcohol would kick in and that her body was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of all counts. The certificate of analysis was not admissible because the breathalyzer demand was not made forthwith or as soon as practicable. The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the demand and there was no subjective belief on the part of the officer that the accused was impaired by the alcohol at that time. The evidence of the police officer was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as prerequisite to a breath demand and the evidence did not support a subjective belief.

2_2007skqb337.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction of dangerous driving. The police did not see the appellant driving; they came across his minivan immersed in a slough in excess of 35 feet off the highway. Based on the tire tracks, the appellant was charged with dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign. In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described. HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. While no accident reconstructionist was available to check the accident scene after the incident, the Crown could have called an expert to testify whether the defence's theory could hypothetically be rational. However, no expert was called. The appeal is allowed and the conviction set aside.","The appeal from conviction for dangerous driving was allowed and the conviction set aside. The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with Fleury's guilt and the circumstANTial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The appeal was allowed, and the convictions were set aside with costs of the appeal. The issue on appeal is whether the circumstance evidence which led the trial judge to conclude Fleury was travelling on Highway #11 was inconsistent inconsistent with an other rational decision. It was the defence's theory at trial, the accused's unwavering statement at the time of the accident that Fleury had not stopped at the stop sign. Fleury argued that, without expert evidence called by the police to prove that it was not possible for Fleury to have swerved in such a manner to create the same physical evidence, the Crown failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The appeal is allowed and conviction is set aside without leaving the court any doubt as to the correctness of the decision. The court found that the trial court erred in law with regard to the evidence. It seems unlikely that a minivan could make a 90° left turn at substantial speed without the assistance of an expert. The collision was an accident and the trial Judge erred by leaving no rational conclusion to be drawn. The accident was an incident in which a generalised conclusion that a vehicle could make 90° right turns at substantial speeds is not possible without the evidence of an accident reconstructionist."

HELD: The accused are sentenced to 40 months imprisonment for the offence of robbery with violence and 4 months consecutive for the offence of having their faces masked. Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months. The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","The accuseds, both 19 years of age, were convicted after trial of committing two offences, namely, robbing cash and miscellaneous items and using violence against a clerk. The accuseds' criminal records were appalling. Most of the offences were committed as young offenders, the youth had been in custody for more than 10 months, the accuseds had been involved in numerous armed robberies, and the clerk was forced to the floor by the accused. The police had to use emergency equipment while searching for the accused, who had been charged with robbery, assault causing bodily harm, and property related offences. The Crown sought a sentence of more than two years in addition to time served on remand. The Court of Appeal gave the accused two credit for time served in custody on remands of 20 months. The sentence of two years of imprisonment was reduced to two years to be served in federal penitentiary as well as two years on remanded. The sentences were based on the accused's lengthy record of robbery, violence against the victim, and need to deter others who might consider committing the offence of robbery. The offences were violent and took place at night. The defendants' lengthy record included robbery with violence, assault, and theft. The fact that the accused had been detained for more then 10 months at a time in 2006, when they were both in custody, did not help matters. The Criminal Code requires that all criminal convictions have at least a ten year sentence on them. The maximum sentence for robbery with a weapon is two years imprisonment, followed by four months imprisonment consecutive to the sentence for the robbery with the violence. The amount of time on remanda is also reduced to time on the remand as the Crown sought to minimize the aggravating and mitigating factors."

Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony. Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed; it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation. The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries. There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot. Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.","The claimant claimed damages for a house sale because the disclosure statement did not disclose a history of repeated flooding. The claimant alleged that the respondent had burned out his shop vac cleaning up water in the basement and asked the claimant to borrow the neighbours' shop vac. The respondent denied having any knowledge of the condition of the property in the past and said the respondent did not have the audacity to disclose it. The court dismissed the claim for damages as it was a reasonable and reasonable person would have assumed that the claim would survive the closing of the contract. It is not the function of the decision maker to tell the litigants who they should call as witnesses or to advise the buyer of any changes that occur in the condition the property may have. The decision of the trial judge, in his decision regarding the sufficiency of the evidence, is not a challenge to the sufficiousness of the arguments made. The only challenge is to determine whether the claims are sufficiently advanced to warrant a challenge in the Court's favour. The test for non-suit is whether the decision makers, in their thinking and practice, are trying to minimize the impact on the general public. The Small Claims Court is a forum for this discussion and it is necessary to allow the parties to present all the facts that can be proven in a court of law. The parties have chosen not to participate in this forum and the court has not made a decision on the suivision of the law."
2_2008skca172.txt,"The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to ss. 255.(2) and 255(2) of Criminal Code. The appellant argued that cross-examination by the Crown was improper and that his conclusions were unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The trial judge allowed the appellant to be cross-examined on all of his criminal record even though some of his prior convictions were not relevant to the issue of credibility and admission of that part of the record was therefore more prejudicial than probative. 2) The appellant was prejudiced by questions as to how the bodies might have moved within the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath. 3) The questioning about previous criminal convictions by the RCMP was not objected to when it occurred. The issue of whether the appellant was the driver of the truck at the time of the crash was not raised. 4) The cross- examination of the appellant's evidence as to whether he was the only person present at the scene of the accident was found to have had an effect on the trial. 5) The defence did not cross- examine the witness on his own or in the context of his cross-and-examination. The witness's responses were relatively innocuous and did not play a major role in the evidence of the accused."
2_2009skpc71.txt,"Mr. Kenny is charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with use of a searchlight when hunting. Specifically, the section reads: 11.1(2) For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The case was decided on the basis of credibility. The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused. The Court stated that, on all the evidence, it was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged.","The defendant was charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with the use of a searchlight when hunting. The defendant was found guilty of the charge. The searchlight was not used for the purposes of hunting. All three occupants of the vehicle were seated next to 30-30 rifles, one of which had one live round in the chamber, four live rounds in the magazine, and one of the two rifles that were seized. The driver and passenger were seated in the back seat of the truck with their two sons. One of the boys was seated next the driver as the driver used it as a spotlight and the other a bird and animal caller. The vehicle was under surveillance on continuous and ongoing basis for approximately 30 minutes. The RCMP were called to the scene of the accident. The Defendant acknowledged that he had been looking for the injured moose earlier in the day but admitted that he was late for work. The officer who pulled the defendant over testified that he thought the moose had been attacked by him earlier in day and was seriously hurt. The defence argued that the defendant was using the spotlight to get a 'light' and that he did not intend to shoot the mooses. The Court held that the first thought that would come to his mind, when he picked the boys up, was that there had been a gentleman from his home area who had been assaulted by moose and was injured by a wayward moose. The second thought that should have crossed his mind but did not. The first thought, when it would come upon his son and nephew, was whether they had been hurt by mooses in the area. The Crown did not accept the explanation offered by the defendant. There were some uncontroverted facts, all of which were consistent only with an inescapable inference that the accused was employing the searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife. The terms'searchlight', 'hunting', and 'wildlife' are all defined in the Act or the Regulations. The purpose of the accused, when hunting, is to search for and to find people. The accused was convicted of hunting in the night with the aid of a flashlight. The term 'hunters' and 'Wildlife' is all defined by the Act. The person who was convicted was convicted pursuant to s. 79(1)(f) of hunting at night with a search light. The evidence was that the driver and his vehicle were driving slowly on roads that were in prime hunting area. HELD: The Court found that the evidence was convinced that the person"

They didn't ask to exclude the public from the hearing, nor did they seek a publication ban.  , the file will be sealed. While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does. The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies. A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs. Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough. Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents). Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern. The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place). There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff. The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered. The open court principle was crafted at a time when the internet wasn't a public source of information and manipulation.","The parties had both requested an order to seal the contents of their divorce file. The petitioner had requested that the file be sealed as a condition of its filing. The respondent had also requested that all documents in the file should be sealed in its entirety. The parties had each requested that their divorce files be sealed to protect their reputation, their reputation and the public interest. The applicant and respondent both sought to have their divorce applications sealed. The issues were: 1) a serious risk of identity theft, and 2) the risk of loss of control over personal identifiers, which can be used to gain access to bank accounts, insurance information and other information. Allowing the application and sealing the file, that the public has a legitimate interest in and expects personal identifier information contained in court documents to be protected in order to prevent identity theft; and 3) the salutary effects of a sealing order do outweigh its deleterious effects because the public interests in an open court is not completely circumscribed by this order. The salutaries of a sealed file do outweigh their deleteriously effects because there is no public interest in the public pursuit of this information. The sealing order does not affect the public's ability to learn about the public’s expectation of privacy in respect to personal identifiers; and 4) the parties’ ability to access the file and to make informed decisions is limited by the state. The court will not allow the disclosure of information that is not already disclosed to the public in any circumstances."

H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing. The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself. An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order. 1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings. 2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected.

The Act does not authorize the the Public trustee to act as a litigation guardian on behalf of H. B. However that becomes evident when s.32 is considered in the context of the entire Act. An order will issue accordingly unless the PublicTrustee, within 10 days from the date of this order, shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party to act.  1)The Public Truste Act does have jurisdiction to represent an adult under mental disability in cases other than where a property interest is involved. 2)The Act does leave the Public Board with jurisdiction to act in any manner other than in cases where a Property Interest is involved (such as child protection proceedings). 3)The Board is the appropriate person to act on behalfof H.b. The Public Board is not an appropriate person as a lawyer or to act for the public trustee. The Board is an independent person and should be free to act independently. 4)The board has jurisdiction to protect the interests of the Board and to act with independent representation to ensure that her rights are protected. If the court fails to intervene, the Board will be left in limbo, a victim of the system.  5)The Court has a responsibility to protect and protect the public interests of H.'s (and other) children.

The defendant were the project consultants for the City, and were involved throughout the tendering process and construction. Their report indicated a number of significant potential problems. The plaintiff was not made aware of the report when it bid on the project. The plaintiff subsequently became aware of the problems, which made their work more costly. After completing the work, it commenced a claim for the additional work which had to be performed due to the undisclosed site conditions. The defendants were joined by the City as a third party to that action. The plaintiff was successful at trial, but the decision was overturned on appeal. The plaintiff then commenced the present action directly against the defendant, alleging negligent misrepresentation. The defendant applied to strike the action on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. Granting the application, that the present cause of action is the same one litigated in the first action, simply under a different legal concept. To allow the plaintiff to relitigate the same action on the same factual basis would be an abuse of process.","The plaintiff was the successor corporate entity of Turf Masters Landscaping Limited by virtue of an amalgamation of the two companies. Turf masters had obtained a subcontract to perform most of the work on a recreational park and sports field for the City of Dartmouth. The consultants for the city had been involved in a previous action which had been described as a'state of affairs' action. Turff Masters bid on and obtained the subcontract for most of construction without being aware of the prior reports. Shortly after commencing the work, the City and the plaintiff commenced an action against Turfmasters alleging negligent misrepresentation based on the non-disclosure of the pre-existing site reports. Turfs Masters commenced an Action under the Mechanics' Lien Act against the City, alleging breach of the standard of care, negligence against the city and alleged negligent misrepresentations by the city. Turfing Masters brought an action under the Securities' Liens Act against another defendant, alleging negligence against both the city's contractor and plaintiff. Turfe Masters applied for leave to appeal the trial of that action and the trial judge rendered judgment against the defendant, awarding costs of $2,500 to both Turf Master and $1,000 to the plaintiff.

3_1999canlii12258.txt,An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children. He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.,"The appellant was granted the right to lead evidence concerning matters relevant to the issues between the parties. The issue on appeal was whether the appellant's expenses fell within the standard of care within the Guidelines. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The portion of the judgment relating to payments under s. 7(1)(f) of the Guidelines was set aside. There was no reversible error in the judge's decision, explained in the reasons for judgment, to reject the appellant’s arguments respecting that issue. There were no errors in the court’S decisions supported by written reasons.

The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached. In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary. 1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another. Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles. The R. v. Emke decision is outdated. 3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty. There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with two offences contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and one for driving while impaired contrary to ss. 253 and 253(b) of The RCMP. The accused argued that his Charter rights were guaranteed by Section 21 of the Charter and that his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure guaranteed by s. 27(5) of that Act. The police officer was on his way out of town and stopped a marked police vehicle. The officer observed the vehicle displayed an out of date sticker on it's license plate in violation of s.27(5). The officer engaged the police lights and conducted a search for open liquor. The vehicle hit the curb, bounced off the curb and rolled off the concrete sidewalk. The officers approached the accused who was not understanding his speech and asked him if he wished to call a lawyer. The defendant blew 170 and 160 on the breathalyser tests and blew 160 and 160 respectively on the two tests. The Crown argued that the officer was trying to establish jurisdiction for the accused in his investigation of the stop. The RCMP officer was not acting within his jurisdiction and had jurisdiction to make the demand. The court concluded that the police officer's duty was to assist the Crown in the administration of justice and the enforcement of the laws in force in Saskatchewan. The Court concluded that this was a reasonable and reasonable conclusion that the officers were acting in the lawful execution of their duties and that they were contributing to the police force's success.

There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home.

The Rentalsman's order required the tenant to pay $2,930.01. The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence. The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process. While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting. The Rentalsman's decision, made after reviewing pictures, repair bills and the statements of house cleaners, who indicated the hours worked and their hourly rate, was not patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the evidence.","A tenant appealed the rental home's Rentalsman's decision. The tenant had claimed damages for rent loss, cleaning costs, damages to the premises and utilities which were not paid. The landlord had also applied to amend his claim to include an amendment to the Residential Tenancies Act to allow him to pay the total sum of $2,930 to the landlord. The Rentalsmann had originally determined that the tenant's claim was patently unreasonable and unreasonable, and therefore his decision was not patently reasonable given the evidence. The tenants appealed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The rental home was properly rented and the amendment was allowed.

A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide. He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status. HELD: The Proposal was accepted.  1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA. The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims. Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal. 2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation. Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.  3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing.","The applicant obtained an order granting court approval of a proposal made by it to its creditor pursuant to Part III of Division I of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The applicant sought to amend the proposal to reflect the fact that the pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor than the unsecured creditors who had been awarded the benefit of the previous transfer and that the indemnification of past directors and officers proposed by the terms of the Proposal was inappropriately wide. The proposed amended para. 9.1 of the proposed proposal was consistent with the provisions of ss. 50(13) and s. 50 (6.1) of the Act. Taking into account the applicant's past and present pension obligations, the applicant proposed a separate class of creditors entitled to preferred or secured creditor status based upon the terms and principles of the Pension Benefits Act, 1992. The purpose of the Court was to authorize the amendment. Taking the applicant’s objections and the court’S view, that the proposal presented was not sufficiently widely cast and inappropriate, and that its indemnification by past and past directors was inappropriately broad, which would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this application, the proposed amended was not appropriately inserted into the terms or principles of this proposal."
3_2004skca49.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] The appellant wife appeals the decision of the chambers judge varying the amount of child support and reducing the amount of arrears. She contends that the chambers judge erred in varying the order for maintenance and reducing the amount of arrears in the absence of evidence that there was a change in the conditions, means and needs of the respondent or the children as contemplated by s. 17(4) of the Divorce Act.[FOOTNOTE 1][2] The respondent contends that the amount of child support should be reduced by reason of his reduced income caused by his unemployment or reduced employment over the last four years. The appellant argues that the respondent has failed to satisfactorily explain his unemployment. There is evidence that his change in income is due to his own voluntary action and, as a result, he has failed to establish the threshold 'change in circumstances' which could result in a variation of the order. [3] The appeal is allowed and the decision of the chambers judge is set aside. There is evidence from which this Court can impute income to the respondent in the amount of $27,000, and the child support shall be varied to $510.00 per month as of February 1, 2004 in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines. The sum of $1,926.78 currently held by the Maintenance Enforcement Office shall be applied to the arrears. The respondent shall pay the sum of $200.00 per month on the arrears commencing April 1, 2004. [4] The appellant shall have her costs in the usual way.1R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd.

3_2004skqb379.txt,"FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. HELD: 1) On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The child is now 15 years old. The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.  2) The access was varied in January 2004. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund. If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4) The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working. The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control. The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use. The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review. The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","FIAT. The respondent applied to vary the support and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 judgment. The 1995 judgment provided for the divorce of the petitioner and distribution of matrimonial property estate to the couple, and custody, access and support for the child of the marriage. The petitioner asserted that he was the sole custodian of the child and that if the court ordered a variation it would require that the child be solely custodian. The applicant, now 15, applied to have the 1995 judgment varied. The court dismissed the respondent's application to vary custody and arrears. There had not been a material change to warrant a variation of the 1995 custody order and the respondent was, as of August 2003, 10 months in arrearars of child support. There were no costs awarded."
3_2005nssc122.txt,"The 23 year old defendant pled guilty to two counts of breaking and entering a dwelling house and one count of breaking and entering a shed. He cooperated with the police and provided evidence against his co-accused. He had a previous criminal record, which included convictions for mischief, theft, break and enter, breach of an undertaking and possession of stolen goods. Defendant sentenced to four years imprisonment; in assessing the appropriate sentence, the court allowed a credit for time already served (which was served virtually throughout in protective custody), a credit of 25% for the fact that the defendant had pled guilty and a further reduction of one and a half years for the defendant's assistance in pursuing the successful prosecution of his co-accused.","The accused, who was charged with aggravated assault, broke into two residences and stole property including a metal pipe. He also entered into plea agreements with the co-accused and the defence. The accused plead guilty to three counts of break and enters. The charges were based on an incident where the accused was driving his vehicle off the road and went off the highway. The Crown sought a period of six years incarceration. The co-occused, who had a Grade X education, had sporadic employment over his adult years. The defence argued that the accused had less than perfect upbringing and co-operated fully with the police, including testifying at the trial of his co-defendants. The sentencing guidelines were set out in R. v. Parker, 1981 CanLII 3363 (ON SC), 61 C.C.C.(2d) 544. The Court of Appeal preferred a sentence of four years and six months in a federal institution, followed by a 10 year prohibition from possessing or consuming a weapon. The sentences were based upon the factors set out by the Court of appeal in Rountree. The offences were committed in respect of a number of residences. The defendant was driving a vehicle when he entered the premises. He was charged under s. 279(2) of the Code and was convicted of breaking and entering. The evidence showed that the defendant had a grade X education and that he had sporadic work over his Adult years at his employment as a labourer. The court was satisfied that the sentences were appropriate for the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence. The pre-sentence report was sufficiently current so as to provide the required information for the Court on this occasion. The trial judge also recommended a further reduction of one-and-a-half years in prison. The provisions in Ritterree were cumulative. The sentence of imprisonment for breaking and enters was reduced to a maximum of 10 years."
4_1999canlii12738.txt,"The accused is on trial for armed robbery and the central issue is identity. The Court admitted a letter into evidence in which the accused attempts to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi for him. HELD: Accused found guilty. The accused was correctly identified. The Court drew an adverse inference against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by. The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's purpose in writing the letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry. The letter is direct evidence of where the accused was not at the time of the robbery and is corroboration for the identification evidence of the Crown witness.","The accused was charged with robbery. The accused asserted that he was not at the club at the time of the robbery but that his girlfriend and his girlfriend were nearby. HELD: The accused was convicted of robbery. 1)The letter was not an alibi but was an attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibibi by perjury. 2)The accused admitted that he wrote the letter to his girlfriend as a favour to the Crown. He did not meet the burden of proof that he did not attend the club. 3)The defence alleged that the accused's failure to identify the accused in the photo ID line-up was a form of fabricating. 4)The allegation that the defence intended to fabricatify the evidence was proven with a precision not found in the absence of a reasonable doubt that the person identified in the picture ID line up was the accused. 5)The admission by the accused that he wasn't at the Club at the relevant time was not a reasonable inference that he conspired to fabricace an albibi. The admission by him that he only attended the club two hours before the robbery was a sufficient inference that the allegation that he committed the robbery is a fabrication. 6)The evidence was reasonably reliable. The letter was found to admit factually, but without making any allegation that it was fabricatious. The allegation that there was a cover-up or cover-ups was not proven as a whole because the defence had no other explanation."
4_2002skca55.txt,The proposed appellants applied to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal of an order awarding costs payable jointly and personally by Tapp and Spelliscy on the basis the award was punitive and inordinately high. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Court is still of the view the proposed appellants would have little chance of success on appeal. Costs are a discretionary award and there was material on file upon which the trial judge could base his decision. The appellants failed to first apply to the trial judge to obtain leave to appeal as required by Queen's Bench Act s.38.,The proposed appellants applied to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal of a Queen's Bench trial judge order awarding costs to the proposed respondent jointly and personally. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs on double column V. The parties had not taken out the order and thus had retained jurisdiction to decide the matter. The proposed appellant principles would have little chance of success on appeal as costs were a discretionary award and there was material on file upon which the trial judge could base his decision.

He questioned the validity of service by mail arguing personal service was required. HELD: Whether the appellant was validly served is an issue that will properly presented to and determined by the Court hearing the appeal. Bringing an application under Queen's Bench Rule 271 would have been a more expeditious procedure. The stay was granted since this was the type of appeal that can be expedited.

4_2004skqb19.txt,"The applicant applied by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents, Zurich and Sovereign, were obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against the applicant. The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident. What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence. Further, the work/product exclusion clauses in the policies relieve the respondents from any duty to defend.","The applicant applies by originating a motion for a declaration that the respondents are obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against them and others by Genex Swine Group Inc. (the 'underlying action'). The applicant specifies that each of the respondents issued comprehensive general liability policies in favour of the applicant. The respondents take the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend (and to pay defence costs) for the claims brought against the applicant in the underlying action. HELD: 1) The applicant is entitled to rely on the allegations made in the pleadings filed against it. It must look beyond the choice of labels, and examine the substance of the allegations contained in the pleadingings. It is only where there is genuine ambiguity or doubt that the duty to defend must be resolved in favour the insured. 2) The applicants are negligent and breached their contractual and other duties owed by the applicant as a result of the application and the use of the Galvalume alternate. 3) The defendants are negligent, and breached the contractual and Other duties owed. 4) The mere fact that Genex alleges both negligence and breach of contract is of no moment to alter the applicant's duty to protect. The application and breach are dismissed. 5) The defendant is also liable to pay costs in the amount of one-half of the claim. 6) The liability is only set out in the terms of the policy. The defendant has a duty to vigorously defend and the onus shifts to the applicant to establish that the claim is not covered by reason of an exclusion under the policy in the circumstances. The liability lies with the insurer."
4_2005nssc253.txt,"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.",The plaintiff made a significant claim for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment under Rule 31.01. The defendant argued that there were significant other factors that would contribute in significant way to her current health problems. The plaintiff argued that she had not been able to establish the motor vehicle accident resulted in her suffering injuries. The summary judgment application was allowed and the costs of the appeal were set aside. The court read the affidavits of the plaintiff's doctors and read the material attached to the defendant's affidavit. It was not the function of the court to determine the matter of an interim payments to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them. The Court was satisfied there had to be an 'air of realty' to the defendants' argument. There had to been an 'inch of realy' to their argument. The plaintiffs injuries were all minor and no one could establish they caused her pain. This was not a case to order interim payment.
4_2006nssc88.txt,"The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","The mother had been paying child and spousal support since the parties' separation in 1993. The father had made arrangements for monthly payments of $2,000 to be made directly to the mother and to the father by the mother. The mother had difficulty obtaining employment and had difficulty paying the father's maintenance. She claimed she had no financial contribution to the children's education and that the father had taken advantage of the arrangement to reduce the payments to $2 per month. The parties' income had declined since the separation and the mother had taken action with Maintenance Enforcement. She alleged she had been unable to obtain employment and that she had now sought and received a garnishee to cover the shortfall in child and child support payments. The evidence showed that the payments were made directly, rather than through the father. The husband continued to pay support, although he paid support less than he had in the past. The payments were found to be in the amount of $52,000, with the father taking responsibility for $52k and the arrears from the mother's care. The court ordered a variation in the order payable in the standard variation clause in the Separation Agreement. The standard variation clauses are contained in the separation agreement and refer to s. 17 of the Divorce Act. The applicant, who was found to have made no reasonable efforts to obtain the required financial support, was found guilty of this type of fraud. The defendant, who had been found guilty in a previous court order, was also found guilty on this count. The Court ordered the defendant to pay $2 million in spousals and child and support payments, plus $1,000 for the mother to obtain financing for a new vehicle. The plaintiff was awarded $1 million in arrear. The amount owing to the husband was reduced to $52 million as he entered into an oral agreement with the mother that he would pay $15,000 monthly in addition to the $20,000 owed to the wife. The wife, who earned $50,000 per year, was awarded the balance of the arsars. The family law judge awarded $2.5 million to the applicant in arsounds and judgments. The garnishehee was imposed in the original order. The awards were varied in nature and the amount owing was determined using the standard form.

4_2017skqb205.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8 The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim. ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order and seek an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the Enforcement of Money Judgments Act and $40,000 security for costs. The first application was denied. The defendants then applied to amend the order to add the plaintiff as a plaintiff and to amend its Statement of Claim. The second application was granted in part. The court reviewed the legal test and adopted the test used in Duke v. Vervaeck, 2013 SKQB 591(CanLII), 138 Sask 277. The Court found that the two conditions specified in s. 20(a) and (b) of The Limitations Act were met. The plaintiff had chosen to await the outcome of the Turkish Proceedings before taking any steps to advance this action. It was not alleging that the plaintiff had failed to proceed expeditiously in the Turkish proceedings but rather that the defendant had chosen, as a result, to await its turn in the investigation of the alleged fraudulently transferred AGT shares. The defendant argued that the stakes in this case were higher and that the added plaintiff would be able to take advantage of the passage of time. The stakes in the case were high. The preservation order was also subject to a conditions amendment in the order that would have required the plaintiff post $2,000,000 in security pursuant the EMJA and $25,000 for costs, as well as a preservation order against the defendant in the Commercial Court. The amendment would also require the plaintiff not to pay any security for the same reason but requiring the defendant to post security for $40. The necessary prejudice has not been demonstrated."

The court awarded costs to the plaintiff fixed at the amount involved - the quantum of general damages. The parties were unable to reach an amount of settlement. In this matter, the defendant argued that the costs should be fixed at the amount actually recovered by the plaintiff. Awarding the plaintiff one-third of her taxed costs, that to reduce costs by the percentage of fault of the plaintiff and to reduce the amount involved would be a double reduction.","The plaintiff was found two-thirds responsible for the injuries suffered when the defendant's vehicle struck her while she was attempting to cross the highway.

The plaintiff requested a reduction in the rate of interest and sought damages. Counsel advised that there may be special circumstances that would warrant an exercise of discretion. The court adopted the standard of review and apportioned costs in such a fashion as to reflect the reality of the accident, and in such circumstances the appropriate rate of rate of appeal would be 2.5% per annum."

The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay. There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges.","FIAT: The accused applies for an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing a number of counts and an order staying proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay. The accused alleges that the Crown breached its agreement to allow the indictment to be appended to the indictment. The Crown then applied to quash the then unparticularized count on the basis that it violated the single transaction rule or, alternatively, to order the Crown provide particulars. HELD: The application to quashed the count is dismissed. 1) The Crown has power under s.590 to order a single count be divided where it is satisfied the ends of justice require it. 2) In light of the new indictment, the ultimate proceedings against the accused are somewhat dependent upon the outcome of the trial. The Court cannot conclude that the findings of the Crown in light of those two trials do not have a sufficient basis to support a finding of guilt. 3) In relation to certain matters which the Crown has determined are not sufficient grounds to proceed against the applicant, the application to stay the proceedings on this ground does not advance the accused's interests more than a broader application of the common law principle of abuse of process. The applicant's application to have the indictment quashed or stayed on the ground that it is based on the requirement of s.51581(2) is dismissed as not being sufficient. 4) In respect to certain of the matters which may appear to make findings favourable to the applicant but which do not, in the sense that the Court has determined, which of the original allegations the Crown was still pursuing against the appellant, (in light of a recent judgment in the trial of the former co-accused) or (in the sense it has now abandoned) then the argument fails at that point. 5) In regard to the first count the Crown frankly concedes that in relation to some matters, the conclusions of Klebuc J. in relation the second count would also, if they were accepted, exonerate the applicant. The latter is not a party to the conspiracy charges but rather a participant in the conspiracy and destruction of evidence which is part of the wider conspiracy and is part and parcel of the conspiracy against the Crown. The conspiracy is a crime under s590 of the Code. The offences were committed against the sole director and shareholder and were proceeds of crime. The only thing that would cause the Crown more interest is to have its charges stayed on a count that was already set aside and to have them considered in light"

No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to s38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act, 1997. The accused was stopped by a police officer as he was proceeding through a rural area when he noticed a tractor trailer travelling in an easterly direction. The officer noted that the trailer was overweight and there were three sets of axles on the unit- steering axle, drive axles and tridem axles. No overweigt permits had been issued to the accused and so the officer issued a ticket to the driver. The Provincial Court did not issue a finding that the accused violated s38. The defence argued that the document referred to was not proof of the Minister’s order according to law, even if the document was proof, the order was a regulation under the provisions of The Interpretation Act and so its provisions applied to it. HELD: The accused’ s licence to operate a motor car was set aside and a copy of the order issued by the Minister was given to the nearest municipal division in which the grid roads were located. The provincial municipality did not have copies of the original order nor could it be shown that the original was published. Even if it could be said that the steps taken by the municipality were sufficient to satisfy the requirement of a copy, the court could not conclude that the offence was committed. The evidence did not establish that the Minister issued the order for the purpose of this case.  1)The Provincial Court concluded that notice of an order issued under the provincial Crown to entities situated along highway #1 that were involved in the transport of goods was the most appropriate manner. The municipality did however take appropriate steps to cause notice to be given. The issuing municipal council directed notice of the minister’S order to the municipal division clerk and entities situated around highway #2 that were in the transportation of goods. 2)The municipality did, however, place road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on highway #332 as well as other signs describing an alternative truck route. There was no publication in any local newspaper or provincial daily."

The issue in this application to vary spousal support was whether there had been a material change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support since their 1999 interspousal contract. The wife requested a 50% increase based on the husband's income increase of 50%. She suffered from MS and was unable to work. HELD: Spousal support was varied to $3,500 monthly. The only material change in the wife's means and needs is that fact she is residing with a new partner who resides in her home in exchange for yard work and housework. Although he worked, he made no apparent financial contribution to the household. The wife was awarded costs fixed at $1,000.","FIAT. The issue was whether there had been a material change in circumstances by virtue of a change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, or financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support. The husband's position was summarized in his affidavit as follows: $3,000 per month spousals will be varied to $3000 per year. HELD: An increase is warranted, but not to the extent claimed by the wife. Spousal Support will be more stringent than the standard of review prescribed in the parties' interspousal contract. The wife's needs have been affected by cohabitation with a new partner. 1) The company's retained earnings, year by year, are now $2,450 for house repairs, maintenance and yard work, $2200 for travel and auto expenses are now paid by the company. 2) The wife is residing with a brand new partner and their arrangement essentially allows him to reside in her home at no cost in exchange for his performing yard work and housework. The income of the wife is not stated. The company has declined sharply that year. 3) Significant argument was centred on whether the bonuses were paid from the corporation's current income or from the prior year's income (the husband's argument) or from a prior year’s income (his wife’d argument). 4) An increase was warranted, albeit not to a extent claimed, by the Wife.

5_2006skca7.txt,"This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC. The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC. The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the respondent was subordinate to a mortgage holding by the appellant, the respondent, Farm Credit Canada (hereafter 'the R.M.'), even though the R.Ms. mortgage was registered before the respondent's mortgage. The appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent. HELD: 1) The trial judge held that the respondent had priority over the appellant. The appellant's situation was distinguishable from that described by Baynton J. in Royal Trust, for the fact that the second FCC Mortgage had priority as was secured by its leasehold mortgage. 2) The respondent agreed to a postponement in favour of the R-M. Even though the respondent did not even know about, and certainly did not rely upon, the covenant in the Grant Agreement between the appellant and the respondent when it advanced funds to Mainline. 3) The Court of Appeal disagreed on the basis of the above authorities that the mortgage held in the appellant's favour was an unregistered interest, as the RMB agreed to one postponement. 4) The appellant could not, simply by registering the mortgage, create an interest greater than that to which it was entitled by its agreement with the respondent in Roberts. The trial court held that, by virtue of the filing of its caveat, the appellant obtained priority over its prior security interest. 5) The appellants were not trying to increase the interest actually accorded to it by relying on its prior registration and priority provisions of the LTA."
5_2007skpc74.txt,"Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.' The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was charged with impaired operation, driving over.08 and breach of his s. 7 rights. The voir dire was held following a voir net on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer. The accused made self-incriminating statements to the officer as a result of his belief that he was reporting the accident. The officer concluded that the accused believed he was Reporting the accident when he gave self- incriminating statements as a reward for reporting the incident. He therefore placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation and for failing to provide a breath sample. The defence argued that since the accused made these statements, even though they were made under compulsion of statute, they amounted to a violation of his rights and were inadmissible. HELD: The evidence received by the officer was as the result of a breach of the accused's s.7 rights. If the accused believes he wasreporting the accident, he gave these self--incrimination statements to police as a matter of course. The admission of those statements would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions of the officer. 1) The arrest was illegal and exclude all evidence obtained thereafter, or at least that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police cannot rely on that information to make the demand. 2) The self- incriminating Statements That Were Made Under compulsion of Statute Have been excluded. The police officer followed up on those excluded statements with respect to impairment. 3) The accused responded to the police officer that he knew his rights, understood the warning and demand for the blood and was cooperative throughout. However, he had no recollection of the police following up on the excluded statements."
5_2008nssc77.txt,"The claimant brought an action in the Small Claims Court to enforce a default judgment it had been granted against the defendant in Alberta for breach of contract. The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","The claimants commenced an action for breach of contract against the respondent in Alberta Court of Queen's Bench. The respondent did not file a defence and the claimants obtained default judgment for an amount not cited in either parties' submissions. The Respondent commenced an application in Small Claims Court for reciprocal enforcement of the Alberta judgment under the common law, and in the alternative, enforcement of a debt as contract. The claim was reduced from the amount of its judgment to fall within the monetary limits established by the Small Claims Act and the parties agreed the issues on appeal were matters of law and the Standard of Review was correctness. The applicant appealed the decision of the Small claims Court adjudicator, who determined that Section 9 of the Act did not provide the Court with authority to enforce an Order arising from foreign jurisdiction. The court found the Adjudicator erred in finding the Alberta Court did not have jurisdiction. Rather than determine a claim based on a fixed amount, it is apparent an Adjudication would be called upon first to settle a dispute regarding the original Court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract, and a factual dispute concerning attornment. Taking into account the purpose of the legislation, the remedial goals, the underlying values of efficiency and access to justice, and the potential for a complex and lengthy fact finding process, the present claim extends beyond the authority of the small claims court."

HELD: It is in the interest of justice to order an assessment. The bills were issued in two separate matters. In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue. There will be no extension of time for the first bill. The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it. He was advised that the bill would be adjusted. An initial adjustment was made and when still not satisfied, ongoing discussions about the bill continued. The Court held that the last document received by the applicant was not the final bill as it was still subject to change. In this case, the lawyer has been paid from monies held in trust for the client, the time being abridged is relatively short and neither party has alleged that any prejudice would result.","HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the bill rendered by the applicant was not a final bill and that it was in the interests of justice to abridge the time for an assessment by the registrar. The applicant’s two bills fell within the period of time allowable for an assessing by the registry, and if not, whether it was the interests in the best interests of the justice to allow for an Assessment by the Registrar. The evidence showed that the defendant had discussions with the registrars concerning the appropriateness of the account at the time it was rendered and for a period of period of Time thereafter. Neither party had alleged or established that any prejudice would result from the abridgement of time. The Court found that it would not be in the justice’ interests to extend the time to assess the account. The application for an application was dismissed. The time being abridged was relatively short. The defendant had given an opportunity to raise the issue or hire alternate counsel but did not do so. The criteria to determine whether a lawyer’ll be allowed to assess a lawyer bill beyond 30 days from the date that the client received the bill was considerably less stringent than it was before the enactment of the Legal Profession Act.

The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code for driving with a blood alcohol content of over.08. The trial judge erred in finding there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial court found that there was sufficient evidence, when viewed objectively, to support the officer's contention that the appellant was impaired. The standard of review is correctness. 2) The appeal court found there was insufficient evidence, which is reasonable, to justify the breach of the Charter. 3) The officer was aware that the accused had slurred speech and glassy eyes but he noted that she had been drinking heavily and that she was swaying in a circular motion. The officer noted that there appeared to be no noticeable wind or other factor to cause the swaying motion. 4) The appellant challenged the objective basis for the belief that there had been a breach of s. 10(b) Charter rights by the failure of the officer to provide the appellant with a warning. The appeal judge did not make any findings of fact that were unsupported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he held that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported the officer’s belief that the applicant’d be able to operate a motor vehicle. 5) The standard required for an effective waiver of counsel is very high. 6) The court found the trial judge properly found that the waiver must be free and voluntary and must not be the product of either direct or indirect compulsion. The Standard of review on a summary conviction appeals is that of correctness. The court reviewed the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Gunn, 2012 SKQB 32 (CanLII), 149 CCC (3d) 571 and the Saskatchewan Court of Appeals set out a series of 11 steps for a trial judge to follow in determining whether detained person has suffered a violation of his or her s.' 10(B) Charter right. The Saskatchewan Court Court of appeal set out the standard of reviewing on a Summary Conviction appeals as set out by the courts of Canada in Connor and Grondin.

An order was never issued and therefore, no judgment was taken out. The applicant now applied to have a formal judgment issued, and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report. The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time. The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour. The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure. She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy. HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report. It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report. There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time. The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old.

5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","The plaintiff and defendant were involved in a lawsuit regarding a sale of three quarters of land in the Rural Municipality of Hazel Dell. The plaintiff and prospective buyer had each made out packages of four or five draft plans for their farm, which they intended to use to explore the market but not necessarily conclude with sale of the land. The defendant and plaintiff commenced this lawsuit after the bidding process closed with the plaintiff not accepting the package offer. The issue was whether the packages were enforceable. The issues were determined through the bidding and post-bidding process and the plaintiff's claim that he had not been awarded the contract. HELD: The plaintiff must prove on a balance of probabilities that a contract was created between the defendant and the respondent respecting the Subject Quarters and that the formalities of the Statute of Frauds have been satisfied. The first telephone conversation was only brief minutes, probably even seconds in duration. The second telephone conversation is all that could be said to have created the contract between the parties. The court accepts that the parties were truthful and credible witnesses. The Court must determine whether a contractwas created between them and the defendant respecting the subject quarters. The germane portions of the telephone conversations were only brief and probably even a few seconds in length. The portions of these conversations are all that can be said about the application of the statutory statute of frauds to the land sale agreement. The plaintiffs are entitled to rely upon the Statutes of Fraud. The Act of Fraud does not require the parties to agree to certain essential elements of a contract. The fact that the plaintiffs had not established that they would never accept the package offers, despite having been assured that they did, does not mean that the agreement was created invalid. The parties were, in fact, createdable. It is only the fact that they had concluded that the Statut of Fraud is not enforceable, and there was no evidence that they were unable to achieve the same result, even if they had agreed to the identical terms. The Statute is not the only determinant of whether a legally enforceable contract exists. The facts and circumstances surrounding the bidding, the bidding period and the two telephone conversations clearly indicated that the contractual arrangement was not in writing. The contractual arrangement could not be established solely on the basis of the wording of the statute. The provisions of the Act do not require binding arbitration between parties."
6_1992canlii4811.txt,"During a hearing involving an application for custody contested by three parties, the trial judge heard only the appellants' evidence and the direct examination of the natural mother before calling counsel to his chambers and advising them that the hearing was a waste of time and custody should be granted to the natural mother. Counsel for the appellants subsequently put the matter on record and requested the trial judge withdraw, alleging an apprehension of bias. He refused, and after completing the trial, awarded custody to the natural mother and her common-law companion. The decision was appealed. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the decision and ordering a new trial, that the circumstances created a reasonable apprehension of bias which resulted in a denial of natural justice.

Her appeal was allowed in part, the court holding the judge erred in ruling inadmissible certain evidence about the value of scallop licences. The matter was remitted to Supreme Court for determination on evidence to be adduced by the parties of the value of the respondent's fishing operation. In preparation, the appellant applied to the Supreme Court for an order to inspect the respondent's bank records pursuant to s. 21(1) of the Evidence Act. The respondent argued he had limited involvement in the enterprise being discovered. The judge granted the order with limitations: the examination was to be limited to income received by the respondent and covering the period from the trial date forward. The appellant appealed, arguing the limitations disallowed full disclosure. In the interim, the respondent went into bankruptcy and argued the examination would be fully conducted by the trustee. Allowing the appeal, that a possible duplication was no reason to limit full disclosure.",This was an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court in Chambers granting an application under s.21(4) of the Nova Scotia Evidence Act ordering inspection of banking records to the appellant but imposing two limitations. The appellant had since gone bankrupt and the Chambers judge had ordered the examination to be limited to that subsequent to the original trial. The respondent had since went into bankruptcy and requested the examination be limited only to that of the companies and vessels he had purchased and that the examination should be limited in scope to the companies' income. The Chambers judge however gave no valid reasons for the two restrictions which he had given. The appeal was allowed and the two restricted books or records respecting the books or books relating to Fundy Associates Limited and the motor vessel were deleted.

He had obtained a Bachelor of Science degree but was unable to complete his final year of Veterinary Medicine because he had received the maximum amount of financing available. The bankrupt had been employed for 5 years as a taxi driver earning a less than average income; he lived at home with his parents; he was single with no dependents. He was reluctant to leave secure employment in an effort to obtain employment related to his educational qualifications. Counsel for the objecting creditor argued that the bankrupt had a minimal income and had the capacity to make small payments toward his obligation. HELD: An absolute order of discharge was granted in accordance with the principles of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.,"The bankrupt obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry and an Advanced Certificate in Science-Physio as a result of student loan funding. He was indebted to Canada Student Loans in the amount of $22,338.99 and Saskatchewan student loans in the amounts of $18,241.39. The Saskatchewan program objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt. HELD: After carefully considering the submissions and bearing in mind the objects and principles of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, an absolute order of discharge is appropriate. 1)An absolute order was appropriate. 2)The bankrupt was just shy of his 30th birthday. He is living at home and working and living at the home and is paying very reasonable rent and food expenses. He has been unable to make small payment toward his obligations. The trustee, on the other hand, recommends an absolute discharge. 3)While the court was not impressed with the bankrupt's attitude, it would be futile to impose a conditional order of discharged in this situation due to the bankrupts low income. The bankrupt is obviously very intelligent and capable individual. sincerely hope he finds a way to complete his degree in veterinary medicine at some point in the future."

HELD: Application adjourned and leave is given to each party to file further materials. The Farm Land Security Board is requested to provide its report to the Court. Ordinarily, the deficiency in the applicant's motion might merit dismissal, but the Act would then give the respondent a 1 year grace period.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The material clearly showed the appellant received notice that he was named as a party and in fact was the only party named as landlord. An itemized list of the damages claimed was attached to the notice. There was nothing to indicate he was unable to prepare and present a defence. 2)There was no error of law. The definition contained in s.2(d)(ii) was considered in Lachance v. Auzano Asset which held s.2(d)(ii) was determinative of the issue. The Act is intended to provide an informal and efficient procedure for determining landlord and tenant disputes. This goal is facilitated by permitting such individuals as property managers to assume the role and status of landlords (Lachance).","An appeal of a decision by the Deputy Rentalsman ordering the landlord to pay the sum of $3,414 to the respondent. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The correct definition of an agent of the landlord is that of a representative for a landlord. The fact that the appellant received notice that he was named as a party in the hearing notice clearly indicated that he wasn't named as such. There was nothing to indicate that he could prepare and present a defence on his own behalf. The only question left is whether an agent is held liable for damages to a tenant. The decision indicates that Mr. Dafoe was the landlord and the appellant was his authorized agent. The facts show that the applicant received notice he was being named as an agent for the landlord. There is no merit to the suggestion that he did not receive notice of a hearing where an award could be made against him. Furthermore, there was nothing that showed that the tenant was unable to prepare and presented a defence."

The procedure on appeal, the composition of the senate committee, its powers and the manner in which they were exercised are probably to be exercised by a body which was not a professional court of appeal and was not bound to act exactly as one nor likely to do so. 5) The Court must not be satisfied that Harelkin v. University of Regina established the doctrine of the 'adequate alternative remedy' as bar to judicial review. The test to be applied is whether or not an alternative remedy is adequate.

6_2007nsca73.txt,"At the time of the deceased's death, she held a bank account jointly with her daughter. Although the signature card signed when the account was opened could not be found for the hearing, the probate court relied on the evidence of the bank representative (who testified that she had the card when she closed the account and she was 100% sure that the account was a joint account and who was able to present to the court the form of the applicable account agreement) in determining that the monies in the joint account belonged to the daughter.  It was also found, on a strong balance of probabilities, that the deceased intended to make an inter vivos gift to her daughter and, alternatively, that the evidence rebutted any presumption of resulting trust in favour of the deceased or her estate. Another of the deceased's children appealed. Appeal dismissed; the probate court judge did not misapprehend the evidence, lack an evidentiary basis for his findings, rely upon incorrect legal principles or fail to apply or misapply the law.","At issue was the ownership of monies in a joint bank account in the names of the deceased and her children. The appellant and the respondents were children of the late Mrs. Scott. A probate court judge had found in 1993 that the deceased intended to make an inter vivos gift to the respondent, which she did. The respondent and her 10 children were children. When the respondent died, the funds in the joint account were subsequently turned over to the estate. The appellants appealed. Appeal dismissed; the probate judge did not find that any of the witnesses lacked credibility; the evidence was such that he did not have contradictory testimony before him. The standard of review applicable for all factual conclusions made by the trial judge was not palpable and overriding error. The same standard applies to questions of mixed law and fact, unless a question of fact is readily extricable when the standard will be that of correctness. The probate justice erred by making a determination when the evidence wasn't sufficient, and based only on speculation and hearsay rather than as required in law; and by not ruling on allegations of breach of trust and conflict of interest against the administratrix of the estate under the Scott Estate Act."
6_2011nssc48.txt,"The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building. The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions. Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income. Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue. When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs. The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries.","The plaintiff and her partner were in an apartment building when the fire broke out. The plaintiff fell from the building's third floor stairwell and suffered serious injuries. The defendant acknowledged that the hallway doors in the building were always open and that the plaintiff's apartment had a fire alarm system that was not functioning at the time of the fire. The fire alarm was not working at the relevant time and the plaintiff was unable to get out of her apartment. The smoke detector in the apartment was not running, there were problems with the fire alarm, the fire alarms were not functioning, the ceiling fan was not properly set off and the fire door was in an open position. The plaintiffs suffered serious burns to their hands and feet as they tried to get to the door. The structural integrity of the building was at issue as well as the fact that the fire had not been properly controlled by the tenant. The defendants admitted they owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs when they escaped the fire, but denied it breached the standard of care. Liability and damages were at issue in this case. The common law duty of caring arises from the proximity of the relationship between a landlord and the tenants of its multi-unit residential building. In this case, the defendant owed a fiduciary duty to the plaintiff to ensure they were reasonably safe from injury while residing in the premises. In the circumstances, the defendants breached this duty by failing to maintain an operational fire alarm and failing to ensure that the plaintiffs, on balance, suffered damages. The negligence suffered by the plaintiffs was manifestly underemployed. The negligent conduct of the defendants was in breach of the plaintiff’s standard of living. Liabilities and damages would have been awarded on a balance of probabilities. Although there was no evidence the defendant was responsible for the fire and the defendant’S conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire, the plaintiff breached the plaintiff standard of cares by failing or failing to establish that the injury occurred because the defendant breached the Standard of Care. The failure to maintain adequate fire extinguishers, the inadequate installation of an operational system and the failure to adequately monitor its fire alarm systems all contributed to the material contribution test. The court found the defendant had breached the material contributions test and the material contributor test was appropriately applied. Although the defendant admitted it owed a fee for the damages and it was not established that it owed an unreasonable duty of cared to the defendants, the court found that it was appropriate to impose costs on the plaintiff."
7_1996canlii6810.txt,"An application for an interim injunction restraining the Regina Exhibition Association (REAL) from interfering with GCB's enjoyment of certain leasehold premises in the Jubilee Building and from entering into any lease with Regina Central Bingo (RCBA) and preventing the operation of a bingo hall by RCBA within Exhibition Park except as sub-tenant of GCB. The original five year lease for use of the Jubilee Building as a bingo hall between Fundraising td. and REAL was assigned to GCB with REAL's written consent. GCB further sublet the building without REAL's consent or knowledge. Written notice of renewal was not sent to REAL. The basis of GCB's application was estoppel on the basis that REAL entered negotiations regarding a relocation of the bingo hall and then began to deal directly with CGB's sub-tenant after the renewal date had passed. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)There was no evidence that Fundraisers, the original party to the lease, attempted to exercise the option to renew. 2)GCB did not have a strong prima facie case on the merits. It appeared that there were no negotiations between GCB and REAL. 3)There would not be irreparable harm. Under the current arrangements, the bingo would be operated by RCBA. If successful at trial the damages to GCB can be easily calculated based on the time it was unable to occupy the premises. 4)On balance GCB failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the inconvenience it will suffer by the refusal of the injunction will be greater than that suffered by REAL if granted.",The plaintiff applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendant from entering into any lease with the plaintiff and permitting the operation of a bingo hall by the defendant except as a tenant. The defendant had refused to renew the lease and the plaintiff sought an injunction restraining its use of the premises by the plaintiff except as subtenant. The plaintiff sought to have the injunction quashed on the basis that the defendant had not exercised the option to renew previously. The applicant argued that the plaintiff had failed to show that the inconvenience that the applicant would suffer from the refusal of the injunction was greater than that which would be caused by its exercising the option in the current lease. HELD: The application for an interim injunction was dismissed. The court found that the tenant had failed the burden of proof that the inconveniences it will suffer from refusal of an option to renewal was greaterthan that which will be suffered by the defendants if it was granted. The sublease contained a provision whereby the plaintiff could have compelled the plaintiff to renew but there was no indication that the union or any other person had exercised the right to renew. On the balance of convenience the plaintiff would suffer less if the injunction were granted and that which might be sustained would be in the cause. On a balance of ease the plaintiff might sustain if the injunctions were granted but the defendant's interests must receive the same consideration as the plaintiff's.

Humboldt's security interests were acquired pursuant to a security agreement granted in 1996 on present and after acquired property as amended in 1998 to specifically include the trailers. It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute. Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease. Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.  6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly. To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air.","The respondent applied under s63 of the Personal Property Security Act for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by the respondent and Humboldt entitled to jointly finance the acquisition of two reefer trailers and directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. Humboldingt denied possession. The issue to be determined was what is meant by the term 'possession' in s34(2)(a) and when in thecircumstances of this case, Lake Air obtained possession orconstructive possession of the trailers within the meaning of s34. HELD: The application was allowed. It was ordered that its purchase-money security interests in the two trailers have priority to Humbolds' security interests. 1)The respondent did not haveconstructive custody prior to December 22, 1997 through either GJ Bell or Mid-Canada.  2)The 15-day period in section 22 begins to run from the date the lessee obtained possession of goods as lessee, and not from the time that the lesSee became buyer of the goods. 3)The evidence showed that the respondent had no constructive possession prior to that date.  4)The application was denied. It is obvious that before December 22/97 the trailers were not in the physical possession of Lake Air until Ford Credit became the creditor. The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the respective trailers were delivered to it by Associates at the location and on the date set out in the lease.

There was no evidence before the Court on the merits of the case as the trial had yet to begin. HELD: The application for a stayed of proceedings was dismissed. 1)The pre- trial publicity had not in any way prejudiced the accused's right to a fair trial by an unbiased jury. It was only at the stage that the trial could be reasonably expected to be held in which there would be an atmosphere of fear and terror. 2)The applicant had not established that his right had been violated on a balance of probabilities.  3)The application for stay of Proceedings based on the unprecedented amount of prejudicial pre-rial publicity was denied. 4)The Court was satisfied that the post-trial media coverage had created a'mere speculation as to the effect of the pre trial publicity'. 5)The applicants application for an extension of proceedings were dismissed. 6)The court was satisfied the preziness of the post trial publicity was sufficient to enable the applicant to establish on a'reasonable basis' that his s.7 Charter rights had been breached. 7)The right to fair trial was not breached at the time of jury selection. 8)The test for independence and impartiality is the state of mind to be tested at the onset of a trial. 9)The trial publicity, filled as it is with prejudicial and inflammatory information has lead to an apprehension of bias. 10)The issue of whether there was an adverse effect of pre--trial pre-judicial publicity was not established at the proper time. 11)The respondent was granted a stay."

The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support. HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel. The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property. The mother was awarded costs of the application set at $350.","The father was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $454 per month. The parties have three children aged four to eight years. Since the issuance of the order the father has been unemployed by reason of health problems and, as a result, arrears of child support are constantly accruing. The father takes issue with the petitioner's request that there be an order requiring him to give notice to the petitioner as to when the respondent's claim is settled. HELD: In the event the father receives a settlement in his law suit against the Government based on his claim of abuse suffered at the Indian Residential School, the first $50,000 will be paid into Court so that the parties might speak to the distribution of same. It is not offensive to direct that the respondent’s counsel, at the time of such settlement, if there is such settlement pay monies into Court. Such an order does not impact the rights of the respondent but merely imposes a clerical task which is natural incident to the preservation of the asset in debate."
7_2005nssc220.txt,"The parties were married for twelve years; there were no children of the marriage. The husband was in the military; the wife was a cleaner on a military base when the parties met and she changed jobs at the husband's direction. She now stated that she was unable to return to work due to health problems, including irritable bowel syndrome, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. Both parties accused the other of conduct which diminished matrimonial assets. The wife's mother had advanced the parties a considerable amount of money during the marriage, with the final advance being the subject of an IOU. The husband is to be responsible for the matrimonial debts, with the net proceeds from the sale of matrimonial home to be paid ratably to those creditors; the wife is to receive 35% of the husband's pension entitlement; husband to pay spousal support in the amount of $1,000 per month for a period of ten years with the order open to variation if the wife obtains a C.P.P. disability pension or becomes fit to work or if the husband retires from the military or makes a proposal or an assignment in bankruptcy which has the effect of requiring the wife to pay any of the matrimonial debts.","The parties were married for more than a year and had not resumed cohabitation. The petitioner was a corporal in the Canadian Armed Forces and was in the second year of a three year contract. The respondent was a high school graduate and was working part-time as a cleaner. The parties had two children, aged eight and nine. The wife was working and living in the same apartment as the petitioner and claimed to have a normal life. She required a special diet and a specialised diet. She also required a strict dietary program. The husband withdrew the largest portion of the RRSP, which he applied to matrimonial debts, leaving $8,000 to be withdrawn. The court held that pension credits earned before and during the marriage were subject to equal division, but for the operation of s. 13 of the Matrimonial Property Act. The pension of one spouse is matrimonial asset and subject to an equal division. The matrimony debts are matrimonies. The deceased is a high-school graduate and works outside the home. She lives with the petitioner. The couple have two children. The Post-Reasons for the unequal division in the marriage are not questions of fairness but of convenience."

The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act. The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3) The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues.","The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent. The applicant asks that the court has authority to order a subdivision of land outside the requirements of the Planning and Development Act. The respondent argues that the provisions of an agreement must, of necessity, be considered merged in conveyance. The appeal court held that at the time of the purported reservation of title in favour of the applicant, no subdivision of agricultural land was permitted in respect of an area less than five acres. The application in question was tantamount to a judicially ordered partition of land to avoid the effect of legislation. HELD: The appeal is allowed. 1) The respondent's position was to insist on the transfer of proposed parcel G, saying the corrals were a separate issue and he would deal with the school division once the land was transferred to him.  2) The School Division attempted to have all interested parties negotiate an agreement. The original transaction was concluded in 1996 conditional on subdivision approval which the Court was obliged to obtain at its own cost. The agreement was executed by Mr. Erker and the Kerrobert School Division. Mr. Klein opposed the application saying he was a bona fide purchaser with no notice of the Flads' interest and relied on the indefeasibility of his title.  3) The appeal was allowed on the basis of the factors set out in the Planning & Development Act, 1983. The Court was not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders."
7_2005skqb372.txt,"The applicant is a doctor enrolled in the orthopaedic surgery residency training program at the University of Saskatchewan (University). He was suspended from the program since approximately March 2000. There have been a number of legal proceedings between the applicant and the University since then. An appeal committee of the University held that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency training on probationary terms. This decision has not been implemented. At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The applicant is such a student. His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended. The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. HELD: 1) The court found the College of Medicine has not been objectively reasonable in the exercise of its discretion to insist that the appeal committee decision will not be implemented until such time as the applicant obtains third party funding. The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts. 2) The applicant is entitled to relief. The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met. The applicant must enter into a written agreement with the College of Medicine whereby he agrees that the money he was paid while on suspension is prepayment for all of the services he will perform for the College of Medicine in the remainder of his residency, that he will not claim any salary or monetary benefits available to other medical residents pursuant to the PAIRS agreement, and he will indemnify the College of Medicine if it is required to make payments to him pursuant to the PAIRS agreement during the remainder of his residency program. Further, PAIRS will enter into an agreement with the College of Medicine waiving the financial terms of the PAIRS agreement with respect to the applicant for the duration of his residency. 3) The applicant will be responsible for paying tuition fees, administration fees, insurance fees and any other college fees payable by other medical residents but he will be granted a credit for the fees deducted by the College of Medicine during the time he was suspended.","At issue was a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The policy states that in order for a student to return to the college of medicine he must acquire third party funding. The student had been suspended from the program for five years. The College of Physicians and Surgeons appealed the suspension with pay and lost its appeal. The university defended the decision, arguing that it had not yet exhausted its appeals within the internal laws of the university and that the student had not succeeded in fashioning an appropriate remedy. The plaintiff requested that the court perform its ex officio role as visitor in this matter. HELD: The Court held that the College of Medical was at liberty to apply the Appeal Committee's recommendation based on the unique facts of the case. It did not accept the College's concern that creating an exception would somehow affect the integrity of the policy. It was not in the College’s nature to insist on a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The Court of Queen’S Bench approved the Appeal committee’ll recommendation. The court reviewed the case law and found that the applicant had not exhausted his appeals within internal laws or the University’ s. 8 core competency. Jurisdiction to determine fairness of administration goes beyond traditional legal supervisory or appellate jurisdiction. The fact that the appellant had not been a student at the time he was suspended from his residency program and had been placed on probation for a six-month period would have obviated the problem. Juried jurisdiction to determine the appropriateness of a decision to place a student on probation goes beyond the traditional supervisory/ appellate jurisdiction of a university. Juridical jurisdiction extends beyond the university’m jurisdiction and is not limited to the imposition of fines or imprisonment. The applicant was granted status to appear at the hearing and did so. The application to have the court intervene is dismissed."
7_2006nspc61.txt,"A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference. The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence. Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present. Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","The accused appeared before a youth court and entered or confirmed guilty pleas to 31 offences involving assaultive behaviour, threats, property damage and breach of court orders in relation to group home placements. The accused appeared to be of the view that her mental health and rehabilitation issues were the cause of her offending. The Crown and the accused sought a ruling from the court as to whether the public, including the media, should be permitted to attend the pre-sentencing conference. The youth court, under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, has a discretionary power under s. 41 of the Act to convene a conference under s19 of the same governing body to consider recommendations on an appropriate youth sentence. The issue on this application is whether the general public and the media should be allowed to attend. HELD: The application is dismissed. The court found that the use of conferences to deal with youth in conflict with the criminal law is a public proceeding and the burden of displacing the general rule of openness lies on the party making the application. The application for exclusion is dismissed and the court ordered that the conference be held before the sentencing hearing. The applicant's evidence is not credible and there is no evidence that the applicant has standing to argue the merits of this application. There is no established procedure by which the public and media may be excluded."

Since the defendant was an uninsured motorist, the Facility Association defended the plaintiff's action against him; however, the plaintiff also brought an action against the insurer of a motor vehicle policy under which the deceased was insured. At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff. The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.","The plaintiff, a cousin of the deceased, commenced an action to recover damages for nervous shock after being hit from behind by a vehicle. The defendant, an uninsured motorist, was charged with the offence. The plaintiff commenced the action claiming negligence against the defendant, who was an uninsured driver. The defendants settled the claim for nervous shocks after the plaintiff commenced it. The Court concluded that the emotional harm suffered by the plaintiff was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties. The Plaintiff's Section D coverage did not extend to her claim. The Defendants agreed to liability for the emotional injury and the plaintiff's claim was settled. The court concluded that such was not the result. The emotional harm inflicted by the defendant was simplytoo remote from obligations contemplated. It is not the Court's intention to conclude that Section D provisions of the M/V insurance policy issued by the defendants extend to protect a person who suffered a psychic injury as a result of the 'injury or death' of a person under the contract."

HELD: Application allowed.  1) The parties agree that the rent for July was paid on July 27. The landlord then immediately applied for and was granted a writ of possession. 2) The tenants advise that the landlord holds the equivalent of one month's rent as security for the payment of the last month rent of the tenancy. The landlord claims it is a security deposit. 3) The tenants claim they tendered the arrears on the basis that the landlord would not apply for a writ of possession and that the arrears were accepted on that basis. 4) The Court of Queen's Bench Chambers judge dismissed the appellant's appeal the same day saying 'the rent for August has not been paid and not paid by required time, appeal is dismissed'. 5) The first issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in finding the Rentalsman had jurisdiction to make the order granting possession on the basis that 'the rent was 15 days in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice' if the landlord accepted the rent in lieu of seeking a writ of possession. The second issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid.","The tenants applied for leave to appeal a decision of the Queen's Bench reviewing a decision the Deputy Rentalsman granted them. The tenants alleged they tendered the arrears on the basis that the landlord would not apply for a writ of possession and that the arrousers were accepted on that basis. Because the tenants believed the landlord holds the equivalent of one month's rent as security for the payment of the last month's rental, they indicated they would not have tendered it if they were going to be evicted in any event. The landlord was granted a writof possession and issued leave to file an appeal book and factum. If the tenants do not appear by 4:00 p.m. on August 31/2006 but do not pay the August rent by the end of August 31, or do not vacate the premises in September, the landlord has leave to apply on 48 hours notice to lift any stay of execution.

The applicant seeks both a variation and rescission of arrears which have accumulated under the original support order.

Based on the applicant's income, his child support payment is reduced from $500 per month to $425 per month.  2) The applicant is in arrears in the amount of $56,365.60. He has provided little explanation for his failure to pay the child support he was ordered to pay other than he was stubborn. It is apparent that he had the ability to pay. The application for rescission for arrears is dismissed.","FIAT: The applicant applies pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a variation of support for the parties' one child, Desiree May Braun-McLaughlan, born February 14, 1992. HELD: The application for rescission of arrears is dismissed. 1) The respondent resides in British Columbia and Ms. Braun, along with the child, reside in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Mr. McLaughlan has properly proceeded under The Inter-Jurisdiction Support Orders (ISSU) Act in light of his residence and the fact that the original order was made pursuant to provincial as opposed to federal legislation. He was stubborn. The respondent provides no evidence as to why he earned little income from 1995 to 1998 and in 2002 and does not, in any way, suggest that he was ill, injured or unable to work for any reasonable reason. 2) Mr. McLaughlain appears to be suggesting that his payment of ongoing support, and any payment he must make towards arrear, leaves him in financial difficulties, given he has remarried and has two more children. However, in order to allow rescission, would have to determine he has, firstly, present inability to pay arreARS and, secondly, that he will not in the future be able to pay the arreared. 3) Given that Mr. Laughlan is currently earning the sum of $45,784 per year, he can afford to pay a reasonable payment towards the outstanding arrerears. Given that the applicant is currently making the sum in the sum $45.784 per month, he has established the necessary change in circumstance, namely, the introduction of the Federal Child Support Guidelines in order of proceeding with his variation regarding his ongoing maintenance payments. 4) The applicant has provided income tax summaries reflecting his income for the years from 1995 through to 2004. He swore financial statement on February 15, 2006 wherein he set out his current earnings. Based on these earnings, he is earning the gross annual sum of approximately $45 million. Based upon these earnings he has an obligation, according to the British Columbia Tables, to pay $425 for the one child. The applicant was served with this motion in October 2006.

7_2007skqb28.txt,"The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code. At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made. The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) and driving while over.08 contrary to ss. 253B of the Criminal Code. The Crown appealed the acquittal on the charge under s.253(b) of the Code. HELD: The Court held that the delay between the time the respondent was stopped and when the roadside screening demand was made took the demand outside of the 'forthwith' requirement of s. 254(2) of s.(1) of The Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained Shire in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of Shire's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search without a warrant was not reasonable and the accused's right to free speech was violated. The evidence obtained from the roadside demand was excluded under s.(2) s.(3) of S.Ct. 615. The Court concluded that the police officers who responded to a complaint of squealing tires and possible drinking should have been aware of the source of the alcohol and therefore made a screening demand. The roadside demand in this case was not made in a random vehicle stop and the officer reasonably believed that he would be issuing a ticket under the Alcohol and Drugs and Substances Act."
7_2015skqb216.txt,"Civil Procedure – ContemptCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 11-16Municipal Law – Zoning Bylaw – Enforcement The applicant rural municipality was granted an order in May 2014 by a Queen’s Bench judge that directed the respondent to comply within 60 days with an order of the applicant’s development officer. That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","The respondent was granted an order pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act, 2007, SS 2007, P-13.2 requiring him to comply with a number of conditions, including that he had to remove all junk cars and abandoned vehicles from his property, and that he could not afford to store them elsewhere. The respondent applied for an order declaring him in contempt of court for his failure to comply within 60 days of the order being made. The applicant applied for the order which was the subject of these contempt proceedings. The application was initially heard September 25, 2014 but was subsequently heard October 1, 2014 and November 13, 2015. The matter was adjourned to May 11, 2015 and the matter was then remitted to February 2, 2015 with the court to determine the appropriate penalty or sanction to be imposed by the court. HELD: The Court was satisfied that the respondent had not shown any reasonable excuse for his initial failure to compliance with the orders nor for his repeated failures to complete the purging of his contempt. The Court ordered the respondent to pay solicitor and client costs of $15,000.00. The court ordered specific damages for the respondent and sought specified amounts of money to be paid in accordance with the order. The defendant was to appear in court on February 2nd, 2015 to provide an affidavit outlining his reasons for not complying with the Orders. The judge also ordered the defendant to pay costs to the plaintiff. The plaintiff will also be responsible for his own legal fees."
7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","The defendant was found guilty of the second degree murder of his common law spouse, who was his former common law wife. The evidence implicating the defendant in the murder was from the testimony of two former common laws spouses, Susan Saxon and Dwight Windrum. The trial judge did not give a Vetrovec warning to either spouse, but instead asked the defendant to give it to the jury in relation to the testimonyof Ms. Saxon, Ms. Windrum and Mr. Saxone. The defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; defendant sentenced to life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for 12 years; defendant given no reasons for his decision not to give the warning. The exchange between the trial judge and the Crown and defence lawyer over the course of the pre-charge conference was instructive in giving a strong indication that the defendant's evidence is unreliable and that his reasons for seeking to use it were not the only ones that informed the jury's assessment of trustworthiness. The jurisprudence on appeal was that the trial judges must give prominence to two factors: the credibility of the witness and the importance of the testimony to the Crown; the judge must give priority to two of those factors: credibility and the fact that the witness's testimony could not be taken to mean that the evidence was biased against the defendant; and the trial court should not interfere with the trial process by failing to give a strong message to the public that the only reliable evidence that a witness has is the one they have heard from the other witnesses."
8_1990canlii2359.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for assaulting a police officer engaged in the execution of his duty. The police officer had responded to a call in connection with a disturbance during which the appellant assaulted a third person. Upon arriving at the scene the officer recognised the appellant as someone wanted by the police. The officer told the appellant that he was under arrest because of two outstanding warrants. The appellant assaulted the officer. The officer did not give evidence as to the grounds for his belief that the warrants met the s. 495(1)(c) Criminal Code requirement, i.e., that they were in a format set out in Part XXVIII and in force within the jurisdiction. In his charge to the jury the trial judge indicated that the arrest was for the assault against the third party and did not direct the jury to consider if the officer had reasonable grounds for believing that there were warrants outstanding. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the evidence did not support the conclusion that the officer arrested the appellant for the assault on the third party and it was not made clear to the jury that they must make an essential determination if the officer had reasonable grounds as required in s. 495 of the Code, such that he was acting in the execution of his duty.","The appellant appealed his conviction following a trial in the Supreme Court before a jury on a charge that he did assault a police officer engaged in the execution of his duties contrary to s. 270(2)(a) of the Criminal Code. The officers responded to a disturbance and found the appellant in a car. When the police officer asked the appellant his name, the appellant gave a fictitious one. The police officer testified that he had a warrant for the assault on the complainant. The appellant argued that the warrant was for assault causing bodily harm and that there were other warrants for the arrest. The trial judge mischaracterized the police constable's evidence as being for assault. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge failed to establish that the constable was in the proper execution of duty and that the reasonable grounds referred to in s. 495 of the Code were not questions to be put to the trial jury."
8_1997canlii9861.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board ordering the appellant to reinstate the respondents and pay them compensation for dismissing them due to their support of a union. The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing, that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record. In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial. As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons.","The respondent hotel manager appealed three orders of the Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia) ordering her to reinstate the individual respondents, to pay them compensation and to reconsider the first two orders. The hotel was owned by hotel employees. The union alleged that the respondent was trying to intimidate its employees to compel them to refrain from being members of a trade union. The Union alleged that in the absence of proper reasons for decisions made, the respondent's employees were being treated as being in danger of being deported. The respondent refused to comply with the orders and the Board ordered the hotel to reinstatement the individual employees and to pay compensation to the union. All five of the respondents did not appear at the appeal. The court reviewed the factors set out in R. v. Burns (1994), 165 N. R. 374 (S.C.A.). It concluded that the Board was not bound by legislation to provide reasons for its decisions and that in fact, in the circumstances the decision-makers (the decision makers) gave no assurance that the ultimate decision-maker, in fact considered the applicant's submissions directly. The Court concluded that this finding was not patently unreasonable. In recent years, with the development of multitude of tribunals with varying degrees of protection from judicial review, it has become fashionable for such tribunalals to give reasons for their decisions. In many jurisdictions, the giving of reasons is now required by statute. In this case the giving is required by law. The giving of reason serves several purposes. First, it gives some assurance to the individual concerned that his or her submissions have been made in good faith that the decision was made in a fair manner and in the best interest of the public at heart. It is not necessary to deal with the other issues. In the absence a statutory requirement the reasons must be given. procedural fairness, reasonable apprehension of bias and failure to give a reasons are not necessary. In such circumstances the giving should be encouraged. In some cases the giving in a written reason is not required by legislation. In others the reasons are required by reason. The Board's order must be quashed because it failed to give them reasons. In other cases the reasons may be inadequate. The reasons should be disclosed in order to have a chance at trial."

The sole ground of appeal relates to the failure of the Provincial Court judge to advise the appellant of his rights to trial by French or English pursuant to Section 530(2) of The Criminal Code and the fact that the trial judge did not advise him of his Rights to trial In French is a procedural error.

The mother was mentally competent and able to manage her own affairs at all times prior to her death; the Power of Attorney was granted solely for the mother's convenience as she was physically infirm. The daughter could only be called upon to account for her use of the Power of Attorney if it was used when the mother was incapacitated.","The plaintiffs sought a detailed accounting from their sister of her dealings with their mother's financial affairs pursuant to a Power of Attorney.

8_2007skqb419.txt,"In January 1992, the parties agreed the petitioner would pay child support of $300 per month and that it would be without tax ramifications to either party. As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900. He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears. The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.","FIAT: The child support order of December 11, 1991 was registered in this Court January 27, 1992 pursuant to the Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, 1983. Under that order the petitioner was to pay ongoing child support of $300 per month. Arrears accumulated and he sought to expunge them. The petitioner supplements his farm income with working for part of the season at a local sporting store. He has a small family farm operation. He supplements his farming operation with an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. Arreears have accumulated and the petitioner seeks to expune them. HELD: The Child Support Act requires an ongoing child obligation to be paid at a rate greater than his legal obligation. Arrebars have accrued and the respondent seeks to rescind them. Arrogars have accumulate and he seeks to abrogate them. He is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. The respondent's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity in the Court to manage His financial affairs and the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears. Arrez have accumulated. The Court was cognizant of the petitioner's farming income. He had been paying at a rates greater than $300.00 per month non-taxable in 1992. However one cannot ignore the fact that in 1992 the payor agreed to pay $300 in non- taxedable. He did nothing to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The arrearage occurred because the petitioner agreed to a bilateral enforcement order in 1992 pursuantto the Reciptrocal Enforcement Of Maintenance Orders. The Family Maintenance Act 1997, S.S. 1997, c.C-8.2 as am. The Children's Law Act, 1997 S.s. 1997 and Family Maintenance act, 1997, s.S.; c.F-6.2 are as am and s.Family Maintenance Act,1997 S.L. 1997 S.) S.C. 8.2 is as am with respect to arrearns.

8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch and filed with the Court of Queen's Bench. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. HELD: The Court has jurisdiction to set aside the certificate. 1) Does this Court have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a true appeal that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. 2) There are at least two bases upon which it can be found that it can reasonably be found the Court is clothed with jurisdiction to exercise its discretion and provide remedy in appropriate circumstances. There are, in the case of adjudicator appeals, at least 2 bases uponwhich it can been found that the Court can exercise its discretionary and provide a remedy in any circumstances. 3) There is no evidence that an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board or an appeal to the Court's Appeals Board is a true appeals. What has been tendered as the basis for the exercise of this Court's discretion is an explanation that the handwritten letter to the Labour standards officer (and not the registrar of appeals) was sufficient compliance, even though at that time the Director's wage assessment had not yet been completed. The Court must have jurisdiction in the circumstances to set up a director's certificate. 4) The Court does have jurisdiction on an applicant’s request, a director’’appeal’, because of the length of the hearing and the time limitation between appeal and hearing. The court was satisfied that the discussion occurred as stated in the affidavits of the labour standards officers. 5) The applicant did not chose to ignore the plain language on the document. This, at the very least, amounts to wilful blindness. In numerous cases wilful blameworthyness has been held to not constitute sufficient reason to set off a director by statute. 6) The court has jurisdiction in situations where a director appeals are a true appealed that questions the decision made of an independent judge after a Hearing. The reasoning of the Court in Farmers of North America is not applicable to these circumstances. A finding that the court is without jurisdiction to open up a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures.

The College applied for possession of possession of its rental unit. The tenant appealed the decision of the hearing officer and the granting of a writ.

8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).",The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking contrary to S. 145(3) of the Code. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused was convicted of assault with a weapon and breach an undertaking. The evidence did not meet the statutory requirements of a dangerous offenders designation and the long-term offender designation was the appropriate finding with a term of imprisonment from four to eight years in penitentiary for the predicate offence followed by lengthy supervision order toward the statutory maximum. The predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the criminal Code.
8_2015skqb6.txt,"HELD: This was an extraordinary event for all of the accused and nothing in the evidence suggested that they required rehabilitation or that incarceration would assist in rehabilitation. The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him. The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years. The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth. The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge. All accused were given an 18-month probation period to follow their incarceration. Terms of the probation included counselling as required and no contact with the victim.","HELD: The Court sentenced the three accused pursuant to s. 267(b) and s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code to imprisonment for common assault. The Court found that the three had acted in good faith and were at low risk to re-offend. The offences occurred over a period of 13 days. The three accused admitted to the offence, and gave a statement to the police shortly after their arrest. They were assessed as being at medium risk to reapply for the offence. The accused also admitted to having a pellet gun in their possession. The Crown sought a DNA order, a firearms prohibition and a forfeiture order in relation to the imitation firearm. The first accused was sentenced to 12 days imprisonment. The second accused was given a sentence of 1 year to 18 months. The sentences were varied but the offences occurred quickly and intensely. The third accused, who had a previous criminal record for driving while over.08, had been in custody for 13 days prior to his arrest. The offence was considered a fit for imprisonment."
8_2016skqb154.txt,"HELD: The order was granted. Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care. Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","HELD: The court found that the children had made a remarkable turnaround and that their parents, both of them foster parents, were genuinely committed to their welfare. The Ministry had taken an active interest in the children for almost three years. The mother had no contact with the children prior to writing the letters to the court. The father had been in the foster parents' home for approximately two years. They had been involved in their home life, their school life and their treatment with the mother. The children had been exposed to violent and sexual acts by their father. The parents had been unable or unwilling to provide for their children's needs and physical harm was likely to occur to them. The child protection worker was retained by the Ministry to complete a parenting capacity assessment report. She was involved in setting up the visits. The court concluded that the parents had not taken sufficient steps to deal with their anger, violence and alcohol issues. The evidence showed that the father had taken no measurable steps to address his anger, aggression and alcohol problems. The Court concluded that these children were in need of protection and that permanent protection was in their best interests."

Yellow Quill First Nation applied for intervenor status. The trial judge found, without giving reasons, that the project was a development as defined in the Environmental Assessment Act and the application for mandamus was adjourned sine die. HELD: The appeal was granted and the order set aside without costs. 1)The proposal was not a development as defined in s 2(d) of the EAA. The Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Environment and Resource Management were of the opinion that the KSS project was not a development as defined in the Act as it did not come within any of the criteria listed in s2(d). 2)The Environmental Assessment Branch was of the opinion that no significant impacts on the environment would occur or if they do, mitigation measures would be implemented to reduce or eliminate the potential for significant environmental impact.  3)It was not necessary to decide whether Yellow Quill or the respondents had standing to privately enforce a public right. 4)In light of the decision the following were not in issue: whether the respondent should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari; the relationship between the Environmental Assessment and Agricultural Operations Act; and whether a proponent of an intensive livestock operation can be required to make an application under the Agricultural Operations Act and to carry out an environmental impact assessment under s9 of the EAA.",The respondents applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for an order compelling the applicant Department of Agriculture to conduct an environmental assessment pursuant to s. 9 of The Environmental Assessment Act. The second issue on the appeal was whether the project was a development as defined by s. 2(d) of the Act. HELD: The application was granted. The chambers judge did not err in granting the respondent standing for the private enforcement of a public right or for mandamus compelling the respondent to conduct environmental assessment. The proposal was not a development under the Act as the applicant proposed. The matter was remitted for a final order. The court found the applicant did not meet the essential requirements of the legislation. The applicant did raise preliminary issues that were not in issue. The respondents should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari to set aside the order of the Minister of Agriculture as opposed to applying for declaration that the project is development under The Environmental assessment Act.  1) The applicant was awarded costs. 2) The chambers court found that the applicant was not developing as defined in s.2(d). 3) The respondent did not seek costs. 4) The court did not permit the use of affidavits taken at their highest probative value as they did not prove on the requisite standard of proof that the proposed project was development. 5) The application of HL Pork Producers Ltd. requesting intervenor status was not necessary.

The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest. The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means. In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care. Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.","The applicant sought 13 orders of production for documents prepared by and in the possession of her service providers. The Minister was requesting the records as part of a protection proceeding. The applicant argued that this was a high threshold for a protection application, and that the documents would not be able to be produced because of their complexity and complexity. Application dismissed; the court found that the requirements of the protection order were high and that obtaining the records would not save costs. The court also found that it would not accept the applicant's repeated requests for documents as proof of the Protection Finding; the records were not relevant to the applicant’s present circumstances and would not assist in the preparation of the parental capacity assessment. The requirement to obtain the records, which must be obtained by means other than obtaining a Order of Production, was not a high priority."

With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday. This order was granted at trial. The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care. HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period. JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court. This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits. CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months. During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return. TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program. KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR. 1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. 2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs. The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. 3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time. KS has quit drinking. TK is now employed. KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction. The parents have a residence. TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health. DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time. TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children. The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser. The success of the involvement of DCR in the life of this family would be enhanced with the assignment of another worker.","The Department of Community Resources seeks orders pursuant to The Child and Family Services Act placing the respondent with the Department until age 18, and placing the child with his grandmother as a Person of Sufficient Interest pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children have the same biological parents. The respondent does not oppose the applications in respect of the respondent and [E.K.] but seeks the return of the child to her care. HELD: The children are in the care of the Department of community resources. The Department of Child andFamily Services seeks orders under The Child & Family Services act placing the appellant with the Minister until age 16, but in view of the appellant's stated intention to return to his parents' home on his 16th birthday, which was granted at trial. The children who are the same age as the respondent are cohabitating. The appellant does not represent herself. She took steps to obtain counsel. She ultimately decided to continue representing herself. The trial commenced June 26, 2006 and concluded September 29, 2006. The issues are: 1) whether the children are properly placed in the custody of the Minister; 2) whether there is a reasonable risk of physical harm to the appellant if the administration of justice determines that the appellant is in need of protection; 3) whether an order for custody of these children should be made in light of the evidence before the Court in respect to the Apprehension hearing. The child who is the respondent in this case is 11 years old and in Grade 8. The Court found that the child who was the respondent to the apprehension hearing was 12 years old or more. The parties agreed that the Court would consider the best interests of the children if they were placed in their care, and that the administration would consider information as to the respondent's treatment compliance from her mental health professionals and mental health facilities. The court found that 11 years of age and the respondent was 11 years, if the Court had a reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant had a psychiatric illness, that the respondent would be more than willing to assist the child in his recovery. The administration of the Children and Family services is to provide, wherever appropriate, services that are designed to maintain, support and preserve the family in the least disruptive manner. The Apprehensions hearing was adjourned sine die. The matter was directed to September 13, 2005. The order to return the children to the custody hearing was dismissed. The application was dismissed on the basis that the children were properly placed"
9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","Dr. Huerto appealed from a Queen's Bench ruling that the Government had not used the AU code to regulate his practice. He argued that because the billing code was not in accordance with the physician payment schedule, the application of the AU coding did not amount to a 'payment schedule' uniquely applicable to him. The appeal court found that both the appeal and the cross-appeal must be dismissed. Both appeals and the appeal appeal are based on the principles of the Protocol and the principles outlined in the Medical Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an individualized administrative process and the aspects of the protocol which deal with the AU codes are not inconsistent with the payment schedule. The principles of that Protocol and MCIA are best characterized by the use of the standard definition of 'payment pattern' and the use by the Government of the code is not an attempt to regulate the practice by the government. Rather, it was designed to facilitate the payment of physician services by providing services in accordance to the physician's pattern of practice."
9_2009nsca91.txt,"The young person appealed his sentence on an aggravated assault conviction following a drive-by shooting and applied for release pending appeal. Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school. Application for release pending appeal dismissed. The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest.","The accused, a young person, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code. Prior to being remanded, the accused was attending a youth centre where he also attended substance abuse and anger management programs. The accused was convicted of the charge, but had a previous record of violent offences. The victim of the shooting said he had been asked to leave the high school he had previously attended as a concern for his and other students' safety after threats had been made. The youth centre student appealed his sentence, arguing that his release from custody would result in him committing more serious offences than is determined to be a fit sentence. Application for release pending appeal dismissed; the accused's release so soon after being sentenced would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice. The Court of Appeal did not find the accused’s release necessary given the circumstances of the offence, his record of violence, and numerous breaches of court orders. The court found that the accused would suffer unnecessary hardship if released pending appeal as his appeal was heard and he would likely already have served more than what is determined a fit sentenced, and thereby suffer undue hardship if he is not released."
9_2012skpc49.txt,"The accused plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault. The victims were his granddaughters. The assaults were alleged to have occurred between 1983 and 1991. A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts. The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.","The accused entered guilty pleas to three charges. The first two were sexual assaults. The accused claimed to have been touched by the accused in his sleep. The third was digital penetration. The evidence of the victims was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there was digital penetrative sexual assault. The Crown sought a sentencing hearing pursuant to s. 724(3)(e). The accused agreed to have the hearing and the three aggravating factors (digital penetration, skin on skin contact and digital penetration) determined. HELD: The Court was satisfied beyond areasonable doubt that both victims were sexually assaulted by the defendant on numerous occasions. The Court could not find that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just over their clothing, and there was no evidence of digital penetration by the alleged perpetrators. The second aggravating factor was that the alleged victims did not recall the specific incidents. The alleged assaults were repeated and repeated over a number of years. The defence argued that the offences could be categorized as sexual assaults but the Court was not satisfied that the counts were repeated. The court was not convinced that the incidents were repeated as the accused took every chance he could to get more. The facts were sufficiently credible, beyond a reasonably reasonable doubt, that the sexual assaults occurred on every occasion the accused was in the company of the girls. The defendant got bolder as time passed and took more liberties and chances. The offences occurred over several years, many times. The victim described only a couple of incidents when the accused would start by feeling and rubbing the victims over their clothes, and then kiss them hard on the mouth and lips and his penis became erect. His penis became large and erect. He breathed heavily. He tried to dry hump the victim. He was always calm and in control."

The finding of the trial judge that the appellant must have known an accident had taken place before entering the store is contrary to the preponderance of evidence.

The guarantor, who had been previously a guarantor under the Mortgagee Act, had previously been a defendant in the proceedings. Prenoran sought a judgment against all three defendants. The plaintiff brought an application for a deficiency judgement against the guarantors. The chambers judge held that the application could not succeed because the order of October 17, 1991 extending the time from the time within which an application could be made was not one the prothonotary had power to give.

The plaintiff settled his future Section B benefits just before trial. The court rejected the defence argument that they were entitled to a credit for present value of those benefits which represented a figure over seven times the settlement figure.

As a result of the arbitration award, several lieutenants were demoted to the rank of firefighter. Denying the stay, that (1) there was no arguable issue to be tried on appeal; (2) there was no evidence the applicants would suffer irreparable harm if the stay were not granted; (3) the balance of convenience weighed against the applicants; and (4) there were no exceptional circumstances.","The applicants applied to have the arbitrator's award for 1989 demoted lieutenants set aside on the basis that the employer had failed to act in accordance with the terms of the collective agreement. The union alleged that the demoted liedutenants were acting in an acting capacity until a new routine was devised. The employer sought to use inexperienced personnel as lieutenant. The applicants filed an application for an order setting aside the arbitration award. The Union opposed the award, arguing that the notice went out to the union president indicating that up to fifty fire fighters would be moved within the fire department every two years.

The case was put to the court below prematurely, with the result that it was put on what was essentially a hypothetical basis, and Charter decisions should not be made without sufficient factual base. There was no evidence that the appellants or any of them had yet suffered any adverse consequences as result of the impugned legislation, although proceedings were pending before the Labour Relations Board which might result in adverse consequences.

b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","An appeal from an application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend after a motor vehicle accident occurred. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff was on company business and was driving his wife's Honda because his company car had a deflated tire. At issue was whether the chambers judge erred in his determination of which insurer was obligated to defend and whether the trial judge erered in his application of the principles of contract interpretation when he decided the Honda was not a 'temporary substitute automobile' within the terms of the Royal policy. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No matter the scope of the inquiry the judge hearing the application for instructions may engage in, the insurer is under no obligation toDefend. 2)The chambers judge did not raise any material issue that would raise a different issue. He simply said in response to the respondent's argument that the standard suggestion by the defendant was 'off target.' 3)The duty to defend arises only when the pleadings disclose a claim which, if proven at trial, would be covered by provisions in the insurance policy. When the provisions of the policy are 'ambiguous' or clearly do not provide coverage for that which is alleged in the pleadINGS, the applicant has no duty toDefence. 4)The Court concluded that the chambers decision was correct and that the proper focus should be on the claim and not on the insurer's view of the possible outcome. 5)The requirement to defend within the meaning of the'reasonable possibility' of exclusionary provision in the policy imposes a duty to protect."

The offender had no prior criminal record, had no weapons or explosives in the state, and had voluntarily quit drinking. The property damage and vandalism had no connection to the offence. A sentence of less than 2 years was also justified."

Rule 25.01 requires that the parties file an agreed Statement of Facts, save in exceptional circumstances, such as one where the material facts are clearly not in dispute.","This was an appeal from the decision of a chambers judge striking the appellant's Statement of Claim. The appellant and the respondent had been equal shareholders in a company that was banked by Gordon. Gordon placed a $75,000 second mortgage on property owned by the company without the appellant' knowledge or consent. The second mortgage was drawn on the Bank of Nova. The plaintiff first became aware of the mortgage in 1982 when it was foreclosed upon. The respondent applied to strike the Statement of claim on the basis that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action or, alternatively, for an Order striking the Statement as being barred by the Limitation of Actions Act.

b_1997canlii11386.txt,HELD: 1)The officer was to answer any proper questions seeking his opinion on audit issues arising in the context of the Trust Company's records or files. To be proper the questions need only be broadly relevant to the issues raised in the pleadings in the sense that they are in some way connected to the allegations made. Hypothetical questions seeking his opinion consequent upon his professional experience could be asked where his and C&amp;L's conduct were in issue. The officer's expert opinion could not be sought on matters not raised in the pleadings. 2)The disclosure and production of documents was justified under the broad relevance test. A party is entitled to discovery of a document if it directly or indirectly enables him to advance his own case or destroy that of his adversary or may fairly lead to a form of inquiry which may have either consequence. 3)The 'damage claim documents' had been provided. There should be a sameness in the manner and isolation of the documents in the discovery process undertaken by each party. Whether the memoranda of discussions with third parties were privileged or irrelevant was a matter for the trial judge. 4)The issue of compelling a response to undertakings had been resolved. 5)The request for an order for an immediate pre-trial conference was redundant as there was no basis for one until the action was ready for trial. 6)Leave to further amend the statement of claim pursuant to Rule 165 had been granted.,"FIAT. The chambers judge granted an order directing the defendants to respond to the undertakings given in the examination for discovery of the plaintiff. The order was that the plaintiff should attend for the resumption of examination for the discovery of Krake and answer questions that he refused to answer or took under advisement, any questions seeking his opinion on audit issues relevant to the action and questions that arise from the undertakes.  It was also ordered that the defendants should provide the plaintiff with the answers to the questions requested. HELD: The plaintiff's application for further and better description of documents was granted. The court ordered that Krake attend for resumptionof examination for a discovery of him and answer any questions that arose from the undertaking. He was to answer these questions and be given proper time to reply.  1)The plaintiff was not entitled to discovery of any of the files or documents requested. The question was whether the documents were properly described and identified so that Coopers Lybrand will not be subject to trial by ambush. 2)The Court was satisfied that the defendant's request for further information was not a substantial complaint. 3)The defendant's application to have the plaintiff's name and address in two of the documents be struck as redundant. 4)The court ordered the disclosure and production of all of the materials requested. 5)Costs were to be determined by the chambers judge."

The 1997 interim order awarded joint custody with the primary residence with the mother and reasonable access to the father including alternating weekends, reasonable telephone access and equal sharing of holidays. The father initially failed to pay child support as ordered then paid $250 per month rather than the $424.72 ordered. The parties no longer communicated directly with each other except by e-mail so that there was a record. HELD: 1)It was in the best interests of the children that their primary residence be with their mother. She had demonstrated greater flexibility and sensitivity to their needs. The father was granted access two weekends out of every three and additional time as they may agree upon. Although both were very good parents the parties had not demonstrated an ability to co-parent effectively as illustrated by their communication problems. The father's access initially went beyond the minimum required by the interim order. He failed to make support payments as ordered. The father was to pay child support of $449. Pursuant to s.7 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines he was to pay 54% of the net cost of child care expenses incurred as a result of the mother's employment and for health related expenses in excess of $100 of the insurance reimbursement upon production of receipts.  2)The automobile constituted matrimonial property and was valued at $200. 3)Either could speak to costs.","The primary issue was the appropriate parenting arrangement for the two children. The petitioner was the primary caregiver and the respondent's parents played a substantial role in the day-to-day care of the children. HELD: 1) The children were to have joint custody with their paternal grandparents. The respondent was to pay child support of $31,800 per month. He was to have reasonable access on alternate weekends. The children would have access on any Friday that is not attached to his access weekend, except when the respondent is working. 2) The petitioner had to be more flexible than the respondent. She was to promote maximum contact. The parties had not demonstrated a willingness to compromise. They were both very good parents. Their inability to communicate with one another was acknowledged. They had made a significant change in the past two months. They are both very, very good parenting parents. However, they could not demonstrate a willingness and flexibility to promote the maximum contact they could have. The child support payable was proportionate to the respondent’s share. The father was to contribute $7 per month and the mother $5 per month; the father was responsible for the breakdown in communication and ultimate inability of the parties to show more flexibility. The mother was to seek costs of the application."

The father lived in Alberta and may not be able to exercise the degree of access he was seeking. The relationships were separate with unique characteristics.,"The paternal grandparents sought an order granting them access to their grandson, R.D.G., born December 1995 pursuant to s. 6.1(1) of the Children's Law Act, 1997.

b_2000skqb36.txt,"The accused, Cote, applied for remedy pursuant to s.24 of the Charter of Rights stating that he was denied the right to be tried on a fraud charge within a reasonable time. Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay. Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.","The accused was committed to stand trial on one of the fraud charges and shortly after the swearing in of the new Chief, the Crown made another demand for disclosure. The accused sought further disclosure.HELD: The application was based primarily on the accused's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time. The Court found that just over 22 months had passed since the laying of the fraudulent charge and the scheduled trial date of February 28, 2000. The Crown acknowledged that the delay had not been sufficient to warrant an adjournment of the preliminary hearing. The application for a stay of the charge was granted. 1)The length of delay was 8.5 months. 2)The application was allowed with conditions. The time period to be considered is the period from the charge to the trial within 10 to 14 months. 3)The Court found no prejudice. The length of the delay was sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay. 4)The accused's request for disclosure was refused as he had been unsuccessful in obtaining the full disclosure requested. 5)The delay was substantial and sufficient to require a judicial Stay."
b_2000skqb420.txt,"FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty. In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.  1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure. 2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.  3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence. It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt. His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","FIAT. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the plaintiffs claimed resulted from the actions of the defendant. The defendant was employed by the plaintiff's officer to provide a contingency basis for payment. The plaintiffs' action against the defendant was brought to trial and all of the claims were dismissed. The defendants' officer brought an application pursuant to Rule 483 for summary judgment under Part Forty. The applicant brought an action against that officer and the defendant on the basis that the officer had assured the plaintiff that he would protect the plaintiff with interest if the plaintiff refused to settle. The officer's affidavit was objected to in particular portions of the affidavit that referenced the word protect. HELD: The portions of an affidavit were struck. The only conclusion that can be drawn from the facts is that the respondent guaranteed the payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. The addition of the word 'protect' puts the question beyond doubt. The portions were all directed to the respondent without objection. 1) The only conclusions that can can be derived from the fact is that that the defendant guaranteed the Payment of the Applicant's account Regardless of the outcomes of their Mutual Client's actions (e.g. if the defendant settles before trial with the plaintiff, the result of the settlement will not be reached sooner than later) is that there is a conflict in the evidence as well as the evidence in chief. 2) The plaintiff commenced its action under the General Rules but subsequently amended its claim on April 26, 2000 to continue the action under Simplified Procedure Rules (Part Forty). 3) The court was struck."
b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither the accused nor the complainant had any memory of the sexual intercourse that took place between them. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1) The Court had broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication. The Court reviewed the cases that dealt with the issue of the accused's belief in the truthfulness of consent and found that such a defence was not available in those circumstances. 2) The defence of 'extreme drunkenness' was successful in the rarest of cases. The accused testified that he was so intoxicated that he could not remember anything before, during and after the sexual assault. He never considered the issue if the complainant was incapable of consenting. 3) The accused's defence of extreme drunkenness was found to be ineffective in the circumstances. The court had discretion to distinguish in sentences for offences committed that were intentionally committed and ones that were commit involuntarily. The defence was based on the unreliable evidence of witnesses who were called by the Crown. The Crown had to adduce quantitative evidence of alcohol consumption and expert evidence to establish on a balance of probabilities that the complainant actually believed she was consenting, which was more of the nature of an assumption than fact. The evidence of the 11-year old son who testified that the sexual activity took place long after the complainant passed out. The father testified that his son had been drinking and smoking drugs the day before and was in a state of intoxication. He was unable to arouse the complainant. The only conclusion drawn was that the father had been unable to detect the presence of a second person (a person who had not previously expressed their consent for the sexual act) and that the mother's denial of consent was in effect an assumption by the accused that she would consent to the sexual relationship. The conclusion drawn from the evidence of these witnesses was that there was no evidence to support the conclusion that the daughter had consented to the relationship and that she honestly but mistakenly believed that she was not consenting to the contact. The fact that the parties were drinking and had difficulty reaching a consensus on the issue was not a factor that affected the decision-making process."
b_2002skqb131.txt,"The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Informations were stayed. The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'. It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court. Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location. The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first. 3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3). There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken. The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances. 4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process. The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress. The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice. The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","The Crown appealed a summary conviction appeal by the Crown that was brought when the trial judge dismissed charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding.08 percent. The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the RCMP was an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs of the proceeding to the Crown in Alberta and $20,000 to the defence in Saskatchewan.  1)The trial judge erred in finding the court lost jurisdiction as he specifically found that if there was loss of jurisdiction it was over the offence. 2)The special plea by the respondent was based solely on the deemed dismissal for want of prosecution in Alberta. The Crown appealed on the basis that the dismissal for wants of prosecution as provided for in s. 485(3) of the Code does not give rise to a successful plea of autorefois. 3)The Court was unable to agree that an appearance by the Respondent in Saskatchewan as a result of a summons issued before May 7, 2001 revived jurisdiction over the respondent in Alberta as well as that of the Alberta proceeding. 4)The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for wantof prosecution on May 6, 2001. 5)The Saskatchewan court did not lose jurisdiction over its offence when nothing happened in March, 2001 and the subsequent appearance on May 7/ 2001. The deemed dismissal did not preclude recommencing the proceedings in Saskatchewan in September. 6)The Crown sought to have the special plea dismissed for wantsof prosecution dismissed. The Saskatchewan court had not lost jurisdiction over it when nothing occurred in March 2005 and the previous appearance on March 29, 2001 but had lost jurisdiction by following the procedure set out in s.(485.1) of The Criminal Code which provides for a dismissal for Want of prosecution. 7)The accused was never in jeopardy in Alberta so the judicial stay is justified."
b_2002skqb250.txt,"FIAT. Saskatoon's daily newspaper applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing in the matter of R. v. Glen Ivor Jones on May 14, 2002. The journalists had no prior opportunity to hear its contents because Jones entered a guilty plea. The application was not opposed. The applicant sought an order for mandamus or a declaration. HELD: The presumption is in favour of public access to court records and the burden to contrary proof lies with the person who would deny access. This right is tempered by other factors (see R. v. SJS). Requiring the journalists to attend at the offices of the Attorney General and playing the CD ROM and making their own notes balances the interests of innocent parties whose conversations were recorded.",The Saskatoon Star-Post applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing. The applicant's journalists had no prior opportunity to hear the contents of the CD-RROM because the defendant entered a guilty plea. The Star-post was able to hear what it heard and edited out the audio and text summaries of more than 200 intercepted conversations. The Attorney General advised the applicant it must apply to the appropriate court with notice to the Crown for an order to obtain access. Both counsel agreed the appropriate courts were the Queen's Bench. The appropriate court was the Court of Queen'sBench.
b_2004skqb105.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applied for security for costs in the amount of $50,000. HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000. 1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant.","FIAT. The defendant applied to have the plaintiff ordered to provide security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The application was dismissed and the amount ordered in the lesser amount of money was increased to $18,000 (the plaintiff was an Alberta corporation and was extra-provincially registered to carry on business in Saskatchewan). The counterclaim claimed that the plaintiff failed to rectify certain sub-soil conditions which were frustrating the work and eventually directed the defendant to vacate the site. The plaintiff counterclaimed for services and materials. The defendants counterclaimed, too. The court reviewed the Alberta cases and determined that the presence of a counterclaim did not preclude an order for security for cost. The judge reviewed the pleadings and the material filed and decided that an order should be made but in the smaller amount of the amount requested. The order for costs was also declined."

Even if the respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, the appellant failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach. The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit. This loss stemmed from the termination of its distributorship agreement with Mato, not from anything the respondent did. As the trial judge found, the termination of the distributorship was unconnected to the respondent.","The respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant.

The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated. The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand. HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame. Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.","The appellant was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over.08. The trial judge found that contrary to s. 8 of the Charter, contrary to the trial judge's finding that the respondent had been drinking earlier in the car, it was possible that he had consumed alcohol within the 15 minutes before the demand. The appellant appealed the acquittal and sought a new trial. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittals set aside. The court found that the trial Judge erred in determining in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. The fact that the appellant was observed leaving the bar was relevant in determining whether it was reasonable for her to delay the taking of the test. In so concluding, the trial court found the respondent would not have relied upon the results of the alcohol screening device test, nor should she have relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can at the scene. The certificate of analysis should be excluded from evidence at trial. The appeal is allowed and set aside and the trial order a new one."
b_2008skqb182.txt,"The tenant appeals the decision of the Hearing Officer granting her landlord a possession order of her rental premises. The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process. The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","The tenant appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer granting the landlord possession of her rental premises. This self-represented tenant included, as grounds of her appeal, 'procedural violations' and'misinformation as to the purpose of the hearing'. HELD: The tenants request an adjournment so that she can make arrangements to personally attend the hearing. 1) The three days notice given to the tenant was insufficient to allow her to make arrangements. The hearing notice was not properly considered by the Hearing officer. 2) The Hearing Officer, in accepting this 'boyfriend related evidence' when neither the Hearing Notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rules of natural justice and due process. The decision of whether or not an adjournments should be granted is inherently discretionary. The decisions must be taken with a view to what is necessary to ensure that justice is done between the parties. The discretion must be exercised judicially by the application of proper legal principles. 3) The decision to properly consider and grant an adjournement is therefore discretionary. In this case the tenant could not have had notice of the nature and extent of the disturbance and damage allegations made related to her boyfriend nor would she have had any opportunity to respond to those allegations. The tenant could have had more notice of this nature and intensity in the circumstances. No notice or warning was needed to proceed to the hearing or to the decision. 4) The hearing officer, in acceptance of this 'girlfriend related evidence', breached the Rules of natural and due justice and the discretion must therefore be exercised carefully by the applying of proper law principles."
b_2009nsca127.txt,"A couple signed a separation agreement which included a provision whereby they agreed to renounce and waive any claim in the estate of the other and any right to share in the estate of the other, which terms were incorporated into a corollary relief judgment. When he died, the former husband had not changed his will, which left the residue of his estate to his former wife. The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift. The mother of the deceased appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed, the appellant had failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounce a testamentary gift after his death. Even if the former spouse were so bound, there did not appear to be any privity of contract which would allow the appellant, who was not a party to the separation agreement, to enforce it.","The testator had left his wife, the residue of his estate, a few years later. They subsequently divorced. Upon his death, the executrix of his Estate applied for an interpretation of the will and separation agreement. The executrix applied for a separation agreement to determine whether the wife had signed a separation judgment which did not revoke the will or had revoked or changed the beneficiary designation in the Canada Life Policy. The deceased had not changed his will nor had he revoked or renewed the beneficial interest in property he had previously held. The wife appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge relied on Billing, Eccleston, Ecclesiastical and Mason v. Garbine, Brecht & Hall, and concluded that the separation agreement did not revolve around the right to renounce a will or a gift made by a former spouse; the phrase 'to renounce and waive any claim in the estate of the other' was used in the case cited. The phrase 'will to renounced' was not used in either case. The wording of the separation judgment was very similar to that in Ecclestone and Mason, but was limited in scope to the use of the word 'will' in the meaning of the term 'to be given'. The wording in the chambers judgment was also very similar, but the sentence in the appellant's case was limited to the granting of a writ of certiorari and the writ of intestacy and did not reference the gift to the wife."
b_2011nsca39.txt,"The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","The accused was found guilty of several drug offences after being arrested. The accused had been charged with possession and use of drugs in a home where his mother had advised him that she was fine. The police had entered the accused's home after receiving a distress call from the accused saying that she had been abused. The complainant advised the police that she and the accused were in a fight and her friend was picking her up. The officers entered the home after hearing the scream outside the home. The appellant advised the officers that there was a person lying on the bed and that she wanted her to come pick her up; she said that she could not get out of the house because there was no one else in the house. The trial judge found that the police entry and search of the accused’s home was justified. The evidence found through a search of his home was not credible, and the police did not have to search the premises to ensure that there were no other occupants. The voir dire decision was overturned on appeal. The court reviewed the jurisprudence regarding 911 emergency response calls and found that although the call was not a 911 call, it was reasonable for the police to search for the alleged victim and to go to the accused accused”s home to ensure she was not assaulted or threatened. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge erred in principle in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry into the home and the search of premises, all without a warrant. The fact that the call which triggered police response was not made by the alleged Victim or from the house is not material. The record here was insufficient for the court, at first instance, to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis."

The petitioner had previously been ordered to pay $1,000 in costs to the respondent but instead paid the $1,000 directly into the child's credit card balance and there was no evidence that this was done by mutual agreement between the parties. The child was not performing well in her program with no explanation for her poor performance. HELD The burden is on the petitioner to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence. Although the child is a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act during the time she was attending classes, her expenses are excessive.

The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem. They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal. HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs. However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient.

b_2013skqb265.txt,"The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer. The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012. On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant. The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss.","The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies Hearing Officer in finding that the tenancy agreement was not a fixed-term agreement and that the landlord is legally disentitled to compensation pursuant to s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The tenant did not attempt to rent the premises following his receipt of the notice prior to re-renting it. He spent approximately $15,000 on furnishing the unit and himself spent approximately 15,000 dollars on the process. The tenant obtained a new tenant effective February 1, 2013 at $2500 per month. 2) The hearing officer erred in holding that a month-to-month tenancy would follow the primary fixed term negated a fixed term. The one-month notice provision referred to in the term of the lease was applicable only if the tenancy was extended to a month to month tenancy following the end of the fixed term (i.e. if the tenant had not complained to the landlord about the noise). The one month notice provision was applicable in the lease only if it was extended beyond the end term (vi). 3) The Hearing Officer erred by holding that the fact a monthto- month tenancy would followed the primary primary fixed Term negated an fixed term and that a one- month notice provisions were applicable only in the sense of the term in the case of Morguard Residential Inc. v. Adams. The appellant did not succeed in advertising the unit for rent immediately after receiving the notice. 4) The respondent gave written notice to the respondent advising she was terminating the tenancy and giving up possession of the premises on the 31st of October, 2012. The hearing Officer erpped in law in holding the fact that a monthly to month tenant would follow a primary fixed- term negATED a fixed Term. 5) The one year notice provision, which was applicable if the landlord was committed to the fixed-year tenancy following its end of a fixed year, was not an issue with the hearing officer."
b_2013skqb395.txt,HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of 10 counts and 7 counts were dismissed.,"The accused was charged with 14 counts of indecent assault and three counts of gross indecency against 14 individuals, all of whom were boys who attended the residential school between January 1, 1959 and December 31, 1967. The residential school was located at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys there. The boys also developed the intermural hockey, competitive fastball and softball teams and the Beauval Warriors, which was the regional champion hockey team through most of the years. There were times when the relationship with various boys crossed the line from appropriate and acceptable behaviour to gross indecencies. The Court was required to take into account the potential distraction of the trier of fact from its proper focus on the facts charged and the potential for undue time consumption. HELD: The Court reserved its decision respecting the application and undertook to render a decision at the time of its final judgment. 1) The Court accepted that there is less likelihood of moral prejudice, reasoning prejudice and propensity reasoning in a judge alone trial as opposed to jury trial as well as a general prejudice. However, there is a risk that the'similar facts' are denied by the accused, resulting in conflict between seeking to admit what appears to be cogent evidence bearing on a material issue and the need to avoid unfairness to the right of the accused to respond. The evidence has a limited opportunity to respond to such evidence. Logistical problems may be compounded by the lapse of time, surprise and the collateral issue rule. 2) The accused truly did care for the boys and were the most important people in his entire life. However the relationship was often tense and there were times that the accused would often be late for work or late for school. The psychological impact of exposure to such exposure can be severe. The impact on the accused personally and professionally is severe. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for sexual assault and the same sentence in each of the 14 counts. 3) The cumulative effect of 50 years of similar facts will have a detrimental effect on the ability of the Crown to bring similar facts to the attention of the general public. The trial judge was required not to allow similar facts evidence to apply to all 17 charges. The issue is actus reus. The length of time between the hearings will likely outweigh the advantages of a jury trial. The preliminary hearing will likely be shorter and the evidence will have to be re-examined. 4) The evidence of the four complainants who"

The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor. The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years. As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800.

The landlord is responsible for $22,533 in lost wages and costs. 1)The evidence does show that a part, but only a part of the moisture entering into the building was due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor.

The applicant could have proceeded to dissolution under Division XVI. In s. 210(m) the legislature intended to give the court the ability to order disposition of property of creditors and shareholders but not to deal with a shareholder’s right to distribution on dissolution.","Shareholders approved a plan of arrangement and sought an order approving it pursuant to s. 186.1 of the Business Corporations Act.

The proposal proposed to distribute the remaining property to shareholders of the company, in the form of money or in property, in a manner consistent with the terms of the Act and in which the distribution of the capital would be based. The purpose of the arrangement was to assist in relieving the Shareholders against the losses suffered by them and to provide those shareholders with a reasonable opportunity to identify themselves and to obtain return of their respective original investments. HELD: The Court found that s.186.1 was being used by the FCC for a purpose which the legislature did not intend. The context within which this was provided must be considered. The application was dismissed. The court found no conflict between the power given by the court in s.210(l) to override the mandatory directions in s220(1) and s220 (1) of the SBCA and that the Court could exercise its power under s. 210(l)(i) while comply with the mandatory direction in s210(1). The application for an order for the court to override s220 and s210 (1)(o) did not engage the arguments and issues that were in play in the present situation.

The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change. These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.",HELD: The Court found that the parties were persons of sufficient interest regarding the child pursuant to s. 23(1)(a) of The Child and Family Services Act and that an indefinite order of protection was appropriate. The Ministry’s position was that both parties were able and willing to provide the minimum level of parenting required for the child’lls needs. The Court also found that neither parent had demonstrated the kind of permanency that would justify any form of reunification now or in the foreseeable future. The issue was whether the children were receiving the level of parental care that was below the minimal standard that will be tolerated in our society. The respondent’d parents were in the position to allow the child to be placed with them.
b_2018skpc52.txt,"/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry. The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","The accused was charged with angling for or consuming fish in waters closed to commercial and recreational fishing contrary to s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995. The issue was whether the accused was bound by s.7(2) of s.8 of the Regulations, made pursuant to the Saskatchewan Fisheries Act, 1995 and whether his Treaty right to fish for sustenance/food was violated. HELD: The accused was granted a stay of the charge. The Court found that the evidence presented was that the accused admitted to the actus reus of the substantial charge but put forth as defence his Treaty rights to fish in any water and at any time he so chooses. The evidence also showed that the restriction on commercial fishing in the area was not an infringement on his Treaty Right to fish. The only infringement that the Saskatchewan government could be found to be reasonably justified was the reduction of the quota for commercial and outfitter recreational anglers to 5 percent. The accused’s evidence remained uncontradicted by any defence evidence."

The court believed the evidence provided by the two accused and found that it was possible that the lease represented the actual arrangement between them and O.G. and that they believed that there only 400 plants in the greenhouses and they were part of a legal grow operation. The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him. Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G. The accused had explained that the cash seized by the police from their house had been received by them after they sold a trailer.","Criminal Law – Cannabis Business – Home InvasionHELD: The Court of Appeal held that an amendment to an information expanding the time particulars of the offence can be made at trial based upon evidence that indicates the offence may have been committed within the amended timeframe. Since the evidence was to the effect that marijuana plants did not start arriving until early June, grant amendment of the indictment to cover the period March 1, 2016 to September 15, 2016. The Court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused were unlawfully producing cannabis and possessed the cannabis for the purposes of trafficking. The evidence established that the marijuana plants being grown on their property was being grown by another individual or individuals to whom they had leased the property for that purpose. HELD: 1) The evidence was undisputed that some 700 plants of marijuana were being grown at the accused's property. The currency in question was not obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. 2) The Court held that the evidence of the accused was not believed beyond the totality of the evidence. 3) Based on the totality, the only rational conclusion to be drawn in respect of the cash found in their residence is that it was property obtained by a commission of an indictable offence in Canada."

A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 236(a) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46 and his guilty plea to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so. The accused had been previously convicted of second degree murder, but his conviction was changed to manslaughter, which was punishable by a term of four years imprisonment or more. The Crown requested a detailed Gladue Report be prepared by the Crown and provided with the court's assistance. The report was extensively researched and produced in detail. The court was satisfied that the Crown had ample evidence that the accused had expressed remorse for the death of his cousin and that there were numerous Gladue factors that the Court should have further information on. The sentencing judge also suggested that a concurrent sentence of 1 year, 5 months to be served in a federal penitentiary would be appropriate. The Court reviewed the cases provided to it by counsel and found that a global sentence of 10 years was appropriate in this case to be serve in a provincial penitentiaries on the manslaughter conviction. The sentences were found to be in the range of what the Court had concluded in Hathway, Ross and Stonechild. The trial judge also recommended that the court use a power of court to delay parole which would require the accused to serve one half of his sentence in each case and for a total of 11 years. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal judge also considered the factors considered in preparing the sentencing decision. The Alberta Court of appeal judge also weighed in favour of a concurrent sentencing order of 1.5 to 1.25 years for the manslaughter and 1 year concurrent sentence for the possession of firearm while restricted from doing it, which would result in a global total of 6 years, 5.5 months to being served in federal peninsular. The sentence was found to fall within the range defined by s. 743.6 of the Code."

These damages arose naturally from the breach and were foreseeable at the time the contract was executed.","The plaintiffs sought damages for mental distress following an aborted real estate transaction. The defendants had refused to honour an agreement made by the plaintiffs and their solicitor, who had advised them that they would be having difficulty financing the purchase. When the solicitor notified the plaintiffs' wife that the defendants were transferring their property overseas, she became devastated. She took to the streets, and her husband, who was the principal in the construction company, sent her packing. She required medication and a long recovery period, and was hospitalized for several months. The plaintiffs applied for summary judgment. The trial judge struck the defendants' defence and entered a summary judgment against them. The plaintiff claimed damages for emotional distress following the failure of the defendants to complete the transaction and for breach of contract in that the plaintiff's damages were awarded in part. The defendant's damages for depression were also awarded, as was the plaintiff and defendant's joint-stock company agreement. The court found that damages for severe mental distress were not available in breach of contracts because contractual damages must be tangible, estimable and compensatory."
c_1991canlii4362.txt,"The parties lived together for some 12 years before separating in 1988. The plaintiff was 53 and the defendant 60. The plaintiff sought an order under the Partition Act for the partition and sale of two properties owned jointly and a division of property owned by the defendant based on a constructive trust. The defendant owned and operated residential rental properties. The plaintiff, who had stopped working as a medical records technician in 1988, maintained the household and assisted in the business by answering phones, bookkeeping, showing apartments and helping with minor repairs. (1) that the plaintiff met the three requirements to prove an unjust enrichment by virtue of the plaintiff's contributions of time and money, namely (a) an enrichment, (b) a corresponding deprivation, and (c) the absence of any juristic reason for the enrichment. The proper remedy was an award of monetary damages representing 25% of the increase in the value of the defendant's assets during the relationship, not the imposition of a constructive trust; and (2) jointly held properties were to be sold pursuant to the Partition Act, unless the plaintiff elected to buy out the defendant's one half interest within 30 days. Prejudgment interest was calculated from the date of separation to September 1, 1991, at 10% per year.","The plaintiff sought an order for the partition and sale of two properties owned jointly by the parties and a division of other property owned by the defendant based on a constructive trust. The parties cohabitated for approximately twelve years. The plaintiff was the owner of a mobile home and her three children from a prior marriage lived in it. The defendant owned six properties in their joint names. The wife worked part-time as a nurse and then became a successful stockbroker. The husband managed the household business for the wife and made significant contributions to the husband's business. The mother was also a significant contributor to the parties' lives. The court found that the wife's contributions to their business and the home were sufficient to support an unjust enrichment claim. The constructive trust established by the wife was based on the principles of remedial constructive trust, which was accepted by majority in Pettkus v. Becker and the principle was extended to common law relationships. The Court found that in addition to the direct and indirect contributions the wife made to the family, she also made significant financial contributions to her husband's construction business and to his business. Awarding the plaintiff $800,000 for past and future unjust enrichment claims, that the contributions are sufficient to constitute an unjust enriched claim and that the defendant is responsible for paying the sum of $650,000 to the plaintiff for the past twelve years, and that she is entitled to some amount for future damages."

The evidence at trial indicated that the alleged acts had occurred prior to the accused becoming an adult. He had not been ordered transferred into adult court under s.16 of The Young Offenders Act. HELD: Accused acquitted. 1)The Judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had sexually assaulted the complainant. 2)Because the complainant's evidence suggested that the assault occurred while the accused was a young offender the Judge concluded that the Court of Queen's Bench was without jurisdiction in the matter.,"The sole issue before me was whether it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual assaults alleged occurred on or after October 22, 1986, the date that the accused became an adult.

The chambers judge did not waive the money paid into Court under the invalid garnisha summons pending resolution of the action. 3)The judgment debtor appears only to have been served with one garnishoe summons once. There has been no application by the judgment debtor to set aside either garnislee summons garnises nor did he appear to the application for payment out. There is a complicating factor because the plaintiff succeeded at suing the respondent and the hotel which were served upon by the garniseshee summons in 1988 and 1989. 4)The plaintiff succeeded in making payment to the hotel and thus the judgment was not dismissed. 5)The Chambers judge exercised discretion in making the payment available to the plaintiff.

In making his ruling, the Chambers judge found that the respondents were creditors of the bankrupt estate for the purposes of s. 38(1). The respondents subsequently commenced an action against the appellant. The appellant applied to the judge assigned to oversee the case management of the action for an order striking the Statement of Claim on the basis that the respondents were not creditors of the bankrupt estate and, therefore, should not have been granted the order authorizing the commencement of the action. The case management judge held that he did not have the jurisdiction to inquire into the merit of the s. 38 order. He dismissed the action. The appellant appealed.

He argued that the chambers judge had erred in that he failed to consider the admissible and relevant evidence before him.

c_1998canlii12367.txt,"The decision of the Board of Arbitration was held by the chambers judge to be fundamentally flawed in that the majority brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had discarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions. She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable. Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. 2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'. Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky. The Chambers judge did not follow that approach. Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears. The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation. Such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges.","The Chambers judge found that the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration in the grievance was patently unreasonable. She found that because the words in the collective agreement could not reasonably bear the phrase 'pursuant to' which the majority had chosen, the phrase was'more reasonable' than the interpretation which the respondent had favoured. The resulting interpretation was not necessarily unreasonable."

Both acknowledged that they were aware of the nature and effect of the agreement and each had independent legal advice before signing. The husband paid periodic spousal support until December 1995. The applicant sought to vary the 1993 order on the grounds there had been a change in circumstances in that her annual income was currently less than half of what it had been at the time the order was made and her economic hardship could be traced to the breakdown of her marriage primarily because his job had required them to move from place to place during the marriage.

The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established. Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement. It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income.

The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement.

Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside. The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints.

The conviction was quashed, the sentence was vacated and an acquittal entered. 1)The trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for defence of due diligence for a strict liability offence. The system implemented by Westfair Foods Ltd. in R. v. Westfair to prevent the sale of tobacco to a minors was essentially the same as the procedure followed by WestFair in this case. 2)The evidence tendered at the trial suggests that prior to the incident on August 25, 2003, prior to Westfair had an established system created to prevent their cashiers from selling cigarettes to minors, prior the company's cashiers had been required to provide identification to the cashier. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. 3)The court found that it is only reasonable to ask a question of a regular employee once a year to establish a defence of diligence for strict liability offences. The question before the trial judge was whether the appellant took all reasonable care in establishing proper system to prevent them from selling Tobacco to minors (ie. they had a proper system for preventing their cashier from selling the tobacco to underage customers). The trial Judge erred by applying an unreasonable high standard of due due diligence. The defence will be available if the accused reasonably believed in a mistaken set of facts, if he took all necessary steps to prevent its commission, and if he exercised all reasonable steps to ensure its effective operation of the system. 4)The Court found that to establish the defence of a defence such as was decided in RFL v. Wfair Foods, the accused must show on a balance of probabilities that the conduct took place without its direction or approval, that it exercised all lawful care by establishing a proper legal system to preventing the sale, and that it took reasonable steps (e.g. ensuring the effective operation"
c_2008skca28.txt,"The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer. The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into. In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit from the respondent, developer. It was the only planned unit of its kind in the warehouse the developer proposed to convert to a 26 unit condominium. The developer decided not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it instead to a single story unit (Unit 5). The appellant registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land on which the warehouse stood. The respondent later sold the unit to third party purchaser. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed orally. There was nothing in the Chambers judge order or her reasons that indicated that she in any way touched upon the substantive issue, namely the issue whether the purchase agreement was frustrated by supervening events. The issue of frustration was not before the Court in any event. The Chambers judge's finding that the remedy of specific performance was not available did not constitute an adverse finding against the appellant on the issue of frustrated. The miscellaneous interests identified by the Chambers court stand for 'interest in land', 'use of property', and 'design'. The appellant was not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'."
c_2009skpc31.txt,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1. The defendant was the President and sole Director of Chisums. The company assembles log home packages in the Weyakwin district north of Prince Albert. These packages are sold to customers across Canada and around the world. The defendants purchased logs from Wood Products (1985) Ltd. (Lamp Products), through its contractor, Logging (P E), harvest wood from the forest in and around Glaslyn. They sell this wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as ChisUM. The defence argued that the process used by Chisuma was more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. The nature of the business as noted in the Corporate Registry shows that the wood is harvested from Provincial Crown lands. It is further supported by the evidence presented that the logs delivered to Chisam were cut as logs to be used in the log home industry. HELD: The defendant's application to have the processing facility licence was dismissed. The court found that the defendant was guilty of violating the Act. The issue was whether the Crown had shown that Chisom requires a processing Facility Licence. The requirement for processing facility licensing was restricted so that it did not apply to every entity that manufactures forest product. The process used was morethan simply harvesting. The creation of a chisum log is processing and must require a processing licence. The logging process encompassed the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to being used in log home. The Process is Not an insignificant process, nor is it process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest land."
c_2009skqb433.txt,"The Ministry seeks an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys Michael and David being placed for adoption. Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care. The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody. HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.  1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys. However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context. There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister. It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted. The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","The parents of two boys, ages 8 and 11, who were apprehended from their maternal grandparents, A.H. and Laura, sought an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoption. The boys' mother opposed the application and petitioned the Court to return the boys to their parents. HELD: 1) The Court found that the parents had a laissez-faire approach to sexuality and that, in failing to detect that, when faced with the prospect of adoption, the parents should have made an effort to retain the boys. They were, therefore, required to be placed with the Minister. The Court ordered the boys placed with their father. The father was to pay a $1,000 finder's fee and was to have the children apprehended. The mother was to retain all of the children's records. 2) The children's parents were to pay the same amount as the father and were to have regular contact with them. The court found that, although the parents' relationship was strained, the children had a positive one. The parents' parenting was exemplary. The children had an exemplary upbringing. The courts of Manitoba have a duty to protect children such that their protection may only be attained through adoption. 3) The court was satisfied that the children were placed with a loving, caring, and caring father. It was also satisfied that, based on the evidence presented by the children, the father had a similar approach to parenting. The best interests standard mandated by s.37(4)(a) is necessarily an individualistic approach. The 'best interests standard' mandated by the Act is necessarily individualistic. An individualistic, individualistic and individualistic ApproachThe Court found the following with respect to the children: 1), that the father's approach to child care was exemplary; 2) There was a continuum of care and attention from the mother to the child and child, and the mother's approach was just as applicable to the foster parents. The child's needs were met in a somewhat unorthodox household where the parents were often in the habit of allowing the boys and their children to roam the house naked and to listen to music while they were with their children; 3) There were no problems with the children engaging in activities with their parents; and 4) The parents were required to supervise the care of the boys in their home. The home was often used as a social gathering spot. The physical plant of the home was a challenge as the children"
c_2009skqb514.txt,"FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008. She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177. 3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.  4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment. As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5) The mother shall have her costs of $600.","The mother has filed a motion requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the 2008 order. As the Gunn J order is premised on the child, Adam, residing with the mother and the child David, residing in the father's home, have no longer resided with either parent. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. The capital gain is a non-reoccurring amount which should not be included in the determination of the father’s 2008 income. HELD: With respect to the capital gain shown on the father, it is clear that the father will not earn the sum of $270,000 in the 2009 taxation year. The father has only one source of income, being his new employment position. It would be unfair to have the father continue to provide support on the basis of an income in the sum that is not quite what he is receiving. The parties agreed in 2008 that the parties would base support for the children on the actual guideline income for the father. The fact that the mother spent his severance funds on legal fees and to set up his new home in Alberta is irrelevant. The severance is included as part of the dad’S income."

The accused was grossly lacking in mental abilities, had limited and basic comprehension, had the mental capacity of a young child and these facts were not likely to change anytime soon. The accused had extreme difficulty paying attention to the court proceedings and appeared incapable of doing so. He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD: The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability. The accused said that his lawyer was the judge, could not answer when asked what the judge's role was and he had limited insight into why he was in Court. The accused met the portion of the limited cognitive capacity test which requires an understanding of the nature of the proceedings and their possible consequences and the accused is capable of communicating his version of the events surrounding the allegations, but there is no possibility he could participate in a meaningful way in the trial. According to R. v. Jobb, the limited cognitive capacity test does not require that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to himself, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether an accused can recount to their counsel the necessary facts of the offence to present a defence. The accused in this case was found fit to stand trial because he had a memory of what happened during the alleged offence despite having virtually no ability to participate in the proceeding.",The accused was found unfit to stand trial for various offences.

c_2011skqb100.txt,A judgment issued from the Court along with a writ of execution. The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750. 1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted. There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order from the Court of Appeal requiring the legal office of the president of the corporation to produce to the sheriff of the Judicial Centre of Prince Albert, the shares owned by the president in Jen-Sim Cattle Co. Ltd. pursuant to the June 5, 2001 writ of execution. HELD: 1) The solicitor's lien arises out of s. 66(3) of The Legal Profession Act. The solicitor has no rights greater than those of the client. He owns the shares himself. They cannot be subsumed to the company and thus become liable to a solicitor's Lien as being part of the records of the company. The claim for lien is not made out. 2) The court found that the president's liens were not valid and ordered the law firm to produce and deliver the shares to the Sheriff. The sheriff was unable to enforce the writ because of the actions of the three solicitors. The court ordered the firm to supply and deliver to the court the shares of the plaintiff. 3) The sheriff ordered the lawyer to produce the shares. The lawyer's lian is not valid. 4) Given the totality of the evidence before the court, the court did not consider a valid solicitor's liien to have been made out as the plaintiff had no other recourse. The defendant had no better right to retain documents than his client would have if still in possession of them. The argument that the receiver cannot have rights greater that those of a solicitor cannot be sustained. 5) The defendant was given several opportunities to produce shares and notice that the non-production of the shares would result in a court application by the sheriff for their production. The judge was unable, however, to determine the amount owing by the plaintiff to the defendant."
c_2011skqb478.txt,"The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code. At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: possession of a controlled substance for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act; unlawfully possessing property (or proceeds of property), knowing that all (or part) of that property was obtained as a result of the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to section 354 and 355(a)of the Criminal Code; possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking; breach of probation; breach probation; failure to comply with terms and conditions of the probation and drug trafficking provisions; breach to probation; aggravating circumstances; the accused's pre-trial detention which included the fact that he was found in possession of cocaine and marijuana at the time he was arrested; the amount of cocaine found in his possession was admittedly for the use of trafficking and he was previously convicted of a designated substance offence. The accused had nine prior drug convictions, two for trafficking and one conspiracy to traffic which resulted him receiving a sentence of five years in the penitentiary; aggravations included the 34 year old accused's previous drug related record; his previous drug addictions; his failure to take advantage of opportunities to obtain employment and the opportunity to make a living as a software developer; and his failure, in this case, to take steps to enhance his skills and training in the field, to minimize the potential for conflict and to promote the careers of young people in the drug trade. The aggravating circumstance was that the amount in the accused’s possession was a substantial amount of drugs in question for the intended trafficking purpose. The amount of money found in the trailer when it was found was part of the proceeds of crime found to be in his custody when he was apprehended and of which he was being found guilty; the defendant’ s. 719(3) and 3.1 Criminal Code provisions did not apply to this case as they did not appear to be appropriate in the circumstances of this case. The court accepted the accused as a compliant prisoner, had no disciplinary issues or problems while on remand and that he would have qualified, had he been in the regular prison population, for a one-third reduction in his sentence for trafficking. The defendant”s pre-sentence detention was inordinately long and aggravating in the circumstance.

c_2012skpc90.txt,"The plaintiffs hired the defendant to perform renovations to their home. The plaintiffs terminated the contract believing the defendant's workmanship was poor and that he caused some damage to their home and created a mess. The plaintiffs sued the defendant alleging damages. The defendant counterclaimed the cost of the work completed but for which he was not paid and compensation for the lost use of his tools. HELD: The Court granted judgment for damages in the amount of $3,822 for necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning expenses and granted the counter-claim in the amount of $580 for unpaid work performed by the defendant and then applied setoff. The Court allowed the cost of issuing the claim and for reasonable cost of service.","The plaintiffs claim damages for $5,975.95 for the removal of a bedroom wall. The plaintiffs claim they owe the defendant for the work done on their new home. The damage is alleged to have been caused by the use of old drywall mud. The defendant admits to having used old dry wall mud. Mud is applied to the crease between the new and existing walls in an attempt to appear flush with the existing walls. The drywall is of poor quality and fell below reasonable standard, such that it is not suitable for painting. The plaintiff claims he should have used more drywall. The issue is whether the plaintiffs were entitled to the cost of the repair work done by the defendant. HELD: 1) The plaintiffs are entitled to judgment against the defendant in the amount of $3,342.00 for the plaintiff's claim for lost use of tools. The counterclaim of the defendant is set off against the claim of the plaintiffs. 2) The defendant is entitled to judgments in the sum of $5.342 for the plaintiffs' claim. The amount awarded to the plaintiffs for the lost use is $3.342.1. The defendants are entitled, pursuant to the terms of the contract, to recover their costs from the plaintiff for the cost to hire a contractor to repair the deficiencies in the defendant's work. The court accepts the plaintiff hired the defendant to complete the workmanlike and timely manner. Because the plaintiffs failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that the defendant was responsible for the damage, their loss of income is not a factor which can be considered negligence. The Plaintiff cannot be held responsible for unfinished work."
c_2012skqb372.txt,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application for relief in the alternative under Queen's Bench Rules 108(d) and amendments to that rule. HELD: The Court of Appeal does not strike the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution. The delay from June 2010 to May 2012 really is a delay from May 2011 until May 2012 and solely on the head of counsel for the plaintiff for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. The period between May 2010 to June 2010 was a time when matters had progressed on a tighter time line. The Court found that the delay was inordinate and inexcusable. As the defendant is retired from active business, this delay is not causing him any professional embarrassment or damage to reputation. It is not at such an early stage that it would lead the Court on its own to strike. The time period from May 2010 until May 2011 was solely on counsel for plaintiff for failing to respond in a manner to the undertaking. The amount of delay was not even an issue on the Court's mind."
c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The issue is whether the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to s810 hearing. The judge ruled that the usual Rules of evidence apply to this s.810 Hearing. The court also held that records kept by the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. Hearsay evidence is admissible. The Crown applied to have the criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and the NPB's reasons for ordering detention admitted into evidence. The defendant opposed the admission of these documents. The Court reviewed the business rules of law and found that the normal rules of trial apply to these hearings. The accused submits these are errors in law in that the ordinary criminal rules of information apply to the s.810 hearings. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)S.8 10 hearings are not criminal trials. The usual rules as prescribed by s. 723 of the Code apply. 2)Hearsay is not admissible in evidence at the provincial court. The normal rules as set out in R. v. Fontaine, 2010 SKPC 16 (CanLII), 359 Sask.R. 277 (O.C.A.). 3)The Court found that s.880.2 does not create an offence but rather it seeks to prevent the commission of a criminal offence. It is preventative rather than punitive. 4)The burden of proof is on the applicant under s8 10.2. The test is both subjective and objective. It must be established (1) that the victim actually fears that the defendant will cause personal injury to him; and (2) reasonable grounds exist for the informant's fear. The first condition is subjective, while the second is objective; namely, the Crown must establish subjectively the informant is belief and whether his belief is objectively founded. 5)The standard of review is correctness on a question of law. The application for bail bonds is dismissed and the balance of probabilities are weighed. 6)The application for an order for a general prohibition of the issuance of a warrant or a warrant of a search warrant in any circumstances is dismissed with leave of court. 7)The usual rules in a criminal trial do not apply. 8)Hearay evidence in a hearing is not an offence."
c_2014skpc114.txt,The plaintiff’s claim was dismissed. The plaintiff had not proven his claim on a balance of probabilities that the defendant was responsible for the damage to his lawn.,"The plaintiff alleges that the defendant applied a substance in the back alley next to his property which caused damage to his lawn in the Town of Wadena. A Back-Track Investigations and Special Services report supports the plaintiff's belief that damage occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of a substance from the back alley. However, the evidence does not support that. In preceding years, before it was moved to the Statchuk yard, it was used to store tools, machinery and applicators. The floor in it replaced before moving to his yard. The defendant's shed was used as a storage area for tools, equipment and applicator. The evidence does support the plaintiff’s belief that the damage occurred caused by the run- off and/ or leaching from the alley. However the plaintiff failed to prove his claim on a balance of probabilities. HELD: The plaintiff”s claim was dismissed. The onus is not on the defendant to establish an alternative source of the offending substance and this involves proving that the plaintiff was responsible for killing their lawn. For the reasons stated, he has not done so. The plaintiff was not entitled to costs."

The appellant sought to recover its losses from the respondent and relied on an exclusionary clause. Allowing the appeal in part, that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct; and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent. In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products. Prior to 1985 that activity, exclusively wholesale, was achieved through a nation wide network of outlets leased from the appellant and operated by agents on a commission basis. Those agents were not required to make personal investment in the franchise, provide staff of two, rather than three, and were financially responsible for the inventory. The appellant knew from the outset that Murphy was not going to operate the franchise full-time, but would rely on former Atlas employees. The trial judge found that the appellant had not conducted an independent investigation of the franchise and found that it was not viable on its own merits. The respondent was adjudged to recover judgment against the respondent, Yarmouth Equipment, for $206,344. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge made certain findings of fact. The evidence was conclusive that the respondent had not committed a palpable and overriding error which affected his assessment of the facts."

Allowing the appeal, setting aside the sentence and imposing a sentence of two years in a federal institution, followed by one year probation, with an order prohibiting possession of firearms following release. Although there were some mitigating factors, they were not such as to call for a suspended sentence considering the serious nature of the offence and its prevalence.","The respondent pled guilty to a charge that he stole a sum of money from the complainant when armed with an offensive weapon, a tire iron. He was sentenced to two years in a federal institution to be followed by probation for one year on the terms and conditions as set out in the probation order of the trial judge.

He would be prohibited from having in his possession any type of weapon for a period of time commencing on the day the order is made and expiring five years after the time of his release from imprisonment.

d_1999canlii1536.txt,"A wife claimed part of the estate of her estranged husband. The Court considered the applicability of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act, the Matrimonial Property Act, and the Pension Benefits Act. Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate, that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed. To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator. This involves a very broad judicial discretion. Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance.","The plaintiff and his wife, who claimed to be the deceased's only surviving child, had been living in India for 14 years. They had been married for 14.5 years. Their son, who was the same age as the plaintiff, was born in India. They lived in Nova Scotia and were together for 15 years. The plaintiff eventually obtained a second estate in the United States. The defendant brought a third estate in Nova Scotia. The deceased's Will was executed in 1997. The parties had each made a separate claim for relief under the Testators' Family Maintenance Act and the Matrimonial Property Act. The cause of death was mixed drug overdose. The evidence led in both respects to the continuing claims for relief sought by the plaintiff. The present-day testamentary capacity of the deceased was in no way affected by the defendant's claim. The fact that the defendant had declared his will in a solemn form to be read by the judge at his Nova Scotia estate estate estate hearing was sufficient to justify a single hearing."
d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposed the application and requested a summary trial. The Plaintiff opposed the Application and sought damages. Rule 488 sets out the test for summary judgement. The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavit material filed but rather, whether despite the contradictory evidence, the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would not otherwise be unjust to do so. The Court accepts the defendant's evidence wherever it conflicts with that of the plaintiff and still concludes the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. HELD: The Plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as bodyshop foreman and assistant manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The griping is not exactly unusual in a work place, and the type of conduct alleged against the plaintiff would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention, if he had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his job function.

d_2000canlii19583.txt,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused was standing in front of the victim's car when he was punched in the face and the victim fell to the ground. Less than one minute later the victim was run over by a truck. The Crown called two disinterested witnesses to an event. The first was the 15-year-old mascot for the Raider Hockey Club. He was standing on the walkway at the rear of the seats cheering loudly. The second was that the accused and five others encountered the victim on the street. One of the others punched the victim and the other punched the man in the arm. The assault was deemed to be an assault on a bodily harm occasioning bodily harm. The defendant was convicted of assault causing death. The court held that the evidence of the disinterested witness was a sufficient cause of the bodily harm to convict the accused, who was found guilty on the charge of assault with a weapon. The disinterested testimony of the mascot and another fan who was in the audience also supported the charge. The trial judge could not find that the cause of death was reasonable or that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm, but convicted the accused of the assault on his own behalf and called his son-in-law as witness. The facts were at variance in material ways and the accused placed the victim in a dangerous position similar to the accused in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. The short period of time between the assault and the bodily damage was enough to support the conclusion that the punch was a contributing cause of bodily damage and not an insignificant or trivial cause."

The defendant had already entered into a technology licensing agreement with the defendant and had only obtained documentation in 1995 and 1996 that it could be used to produce potassium sulphates. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had breached the terms of the Technology Licensing Agreement. The defendants denied that they had any relationship and asserted that they were only marketing potassium sulphide. HELD: The plaintiff was prohibited from marketing any potassium sulphated and from having its contact with any of the defendants. 1) The defendant was found to have a proprietary interest in the scientific principles of ion exchange and crystallization. Such was not the only technology licensed to the defendant by the defendant. 2) The plaintiff had already established a technology license with the defendants and had not obtained any assurances that the other technology was being used by the plaintiff that could even remotely be considered technology. The fact that the plaintiff had not established that the technology was the only one that could be considered technically advanced technology had no bearing on the defendant's claim that it had entered into the technology licensing agreements. The evidence established that Big Quill had already acquired the assets of the plaintiff and was not only the only source for such technology but also the only supplier of potassium sulphite to the plaintiff's needs. The court ordered further injunctions and ancillary relief ordered by way of injunction or otherwise as counsel may advise and the court may allow.

The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","The husband applied to have the matrimonial home sold and ordered that the value of the matron home be divided equally. The wife also applied for an interlocutory order that the home be sold without the benefit of professional appraisal or any compelling reason and that the judge ordered that all personal belongings be returned except for the matrionial home which had been sold for an exorbitant sum and which had not been properly established. The husband also applied to vary the value and value of his property by incorporating some of the wife's belongings into his property. The parties had been married for 15 years and had two children. The mother now owned a home and supported herself on social assistance disability. She needed spousal support but was unable to afford a new home and the husband's modest pension and investment income had been terminated. She also needed to return some of her belongings. The Chambers judge ordered the sale of the home and ordered it to be sold within two months. The matrimonious application for a division of matrimony assets was dismissed and the wife now had costs in the amount of $1,500. Both parties appealed the Chambers judge's decision claiming a reversible error in the manner he justified selling the matonial home and that he was influenced by irrelevant considerations.

d_2006nssc73.txt,"Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.","The parties were married for four years and had four children. The petitioner had been employed as a taxi driver for many years and obtained a university degree. She worked part-time and then became a social worker. The parties had four young children, aged eight, 13 and 14. The respondent was employed as an executive with the federal government. He lived in the same apartment as the petitioner and had three children, two of which were with his daughter. The wife had recently graduated from university and was working part- time. She was the primary parent of the children. They had difficulty finding a suitable apartment. The husband, who was working long hours and lived in an apartment close to the children's school, often made arrangements to take the children to sporting events or stayed with a friend when they were away. The mother was often late or unable to attend school. The children's daily activities and activities were often disrupted by the husband's constant driving. The court found that it would be in the children best interests to remain in the home with the mother and that it was in the best interests of the parties to have their children primarily reside with the father."
d_2007skpc27.txt,"The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.",The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The Crown applied to have the initial statements made by the complainant admitted into evidence for the truth of their contents as an exception to the rule which excludes hearsay evidence. The facts were relatively straight-forward and the complainant was the common- law spouse of the accused for seven years. She was upset and crying. The accused asked that the police be called. The complainant was later seen by her neighbour. She said she was afraid of the police and that they would get aggressive. The police arrived within minutes of the complainant arriving at her home. She asked that they be called and she was upset. She also stated that she had fresh red marks on her neck and chest that corresponded with her description of the incident and that she was concerned that her boyfriend had punched her. The evidence was important to the Crown's case and there was no other means of obtaining that evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she was a hostile witness was immaterial.

The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with two counts of breaking and entering in relation to a private communications offence, the sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code and the abduction contrary to ss. 273(1(2)(c) being Schedule B to the Canada Act. The accused argued that the evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception was inadmissible because it was not contained in a sufficient file to warrant an exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: The evidence was in admissible and did not violate the accused's s. 8 rights. Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s.8, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. The intercepted communication was non-consecutive evidence and was properly admitted by the trial judge. The Court found that the accused had sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The evidence is non-custodial and does not violate s.24(2) of The Charter. Even though the accused did not know that the police were intercepting private communications, the offence was listed in the definition section of the Code and was not included in the authorization sought. The surreptitious recording did not compel or coerce the accused to speak. The conversation was not inadmissible."
d_2008nssc145.txt,"The intestate's biological child, who was one of the personal representatives of the estate, wished to sue the intestate's former employer to have the pension to which he was entitled at the time of his death paid into the estate. The other personal representative of the estate, who was the intestate's spouse, was in receipt of survivor benefits under the pension and, as such, was opposed to the intended court action. The biological child applied to have his stepmother removed as a personal representative of the estate. Application dismissed; the removal of the personal representative would only be in the best interests of those persons interested in the estate if the intended lawsuit was feasible, which it was not. The estate was bound by the terms of the pension plan, which provided that the respondent was clearly entitled, as the spouse of the intestate, to survivor benefits and the payment of a lump sum into her estate if she died within five years of the intestate's retirement.","The Respondent was a spouse within the meaning of the Pension Benefits Standards Act and the Pension Security Standards Act but was separated from his wife, the biological mother of the applicants. The respondent was employed by Marine Atlantic for thirty-one years. During that period, the estate received no monies from the corporation. The applicants sought the removal of the personal representative, who was a former employee of the corporation, and a pension plan beneficiary, and therefore was not entitled to the survivor benefits. The Respondent applied for an order removing the personal representatives as they were in conflict. The applicant argued that the respondent should be removed as Adminstratrix of the Estate and that the estate should pursue an action in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia against the corporation and the corporation for payment into the estate of the pension plan entitlement earned by the Intestate and for reimbursement by the corporation of the amounts already paid to her. The respondents argued that they were entitled to survivor benefits pursuant to the plan but believed the applicant was the spouse of the deceased and entitled to be paid survivor benefits under the plan. The application was dismissed. HELD: The application must fail. The removal of Joan McGean as personal representative is not in the 'best interests of those persons interested in the estate' (aside from the fact that the applicant is a spouse) and is not a common law spouse, and the termination of the respondent's pension benefits would be of no benefit to her as a spouse. The estate took no steps to change the Respondent's status in law, that is, he never divorced her."
d_2012skqb237.txt,"The appellant was convicted of driving over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath.","An appeal from a conviction in the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan that the appellant did, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The trial judge was in a position to test the credibility of the trial judge. In coming to his conclusion he considered the totality of the evidence, the trial Judge considered the facts. The trial court found that the trial officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath, and the appellant’s claim for breach of the Charter must fail. 2) The officer was in the position to assess the credibilityof the trial court due to the fact that she was in such an advanced stage of her career in law enforcement and had reasonable, probable grounds as to making a demand for a breath sample only minutes before she was uncertain as whether she had reasonable or probable grounds. The subjective element in determining whether she has reasonable and likely grounds to make a demand is not present. 3) The evidence was not clear that the officer observed the bloodshot eyes of the respondent after making the formal arrest as argued by the appellant. The appellant was in breach of his Charter rights by making the demand. The officer’d been in a situation to test her credibility. The court found the trial justice was in position to find that the respondent had reasonableand probable grounds after making a breath demand to which she was not obliged to add any new evidence, further evidence was obtained after the demand and the respondent’ s.8 Charter rights were infringed. 4) The court was satisfied that the court could not substitute its own conclusion of substantial error involving the evidence. The decision of the court was reasonable and supported by the evidence and the appeal was therefore dismissed."
d_2013skca10.txt,"The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, the Court declared him a long-term offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. He appealed from this sentence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The defendant was found not guilty of all the predicate offences. The Court found that the trial judge failed to give adequate consideration to the opinions of the two expert witnesses who both recommended he be declared a long term offender and that he be sentenced to an an indeterminedate sentence (Life). 2) The Court also found that in addition to the four offences of sexual assaulting, the defendant had also committed two acts of sexual misconduct against a prostitute which were of significant consequence to his risk of re-offending. The defendant had been in custody for more than five years. The offences occurred in an alley, parked in a back alley and they both proceeded to get into the van. The Defendant then drove into a back alley, parked and drove into the complainant's street. The complainant was unable to escape the van and the defendant entered the driver's block. The second defendant entered a backalley, park and drove onto the complainant and assaulted her and her friend. The third defendant entered into a verbal agreement to perform oral sex on him and the complainant lost consciousness. The trial judge concluded that the agreement was valid and that the defendant should be commuted to an indefinite period of time. The conviction was based upon the fact that the sentences were imposed on the repeat offenders rather than on the new offenders. The sentences were based on the defendant's repeated repeated repeat repeat of the offences and he was found to be in a much worse position to commit these offences. 3) The Defendant was found guilty of both counts of sexually assault. The court found that he was a long time offender and therefore a dangerous offender. The fact that he had been previously incarcerated and had not participated in programming at the high intensity level did not disqualify him from participating in the high-intensity sexual offender programs. The evidence also established that the Defendant had a history of aggressive, aggressive and irrational behaviour. The judge was also found to have accepted the experts' assessment of his own behaviour, which was not supported by the evidence. The new evidence also showed that the accused had a high risk of relapse and that his risk for relapse was substantial. The accused appealed. Appeal dismissed;"
d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","The plaintiff union and its representatives republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The union and the Hospital both appealed. Appeal allowed; general damages at $100,000 fixed; the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements are protected by qualified privilege. The plaintiff union's action was to refer the matter to arbitration for an inquiry into whether the statements protected by absolute and qualified privilege apply. The trial judge found that the statements were published, but the words were published and destroyed any possible claim that the Union might have to absolute privilege. As the plaintiff had been highly critical of the Union, its publication would have had a neutralizing effect on its claim that it had to absolute privileged. The Union's statement of defence was based on an opinion by the Union's President that there was no merit to the defamed statements and that the words expressed by the union were published to at least one person other than the plaintiff. The court concluded that the trial court erred in finding that the defamsatory statements were protected byqualified privilege. It would not be appropriate to award general damages of $100k to the plaintiff union. The Court would not accept an award of $25,000 to the union for breach of the collective agreement. As most of the plaintiff's information would have been lost if the union published a grievance alleging that the plaintiff was being harassed, it would be inappropriate for the court to award damages to the Union. The grievance was published in an entirely different manner than the one in question and was edited out of relevance to the trial decision. The awards were based on the fact that the union had published the grievance and not the grievance officer's opinion that it was being defamed. The publication of the grievance was a preordained proceeding and the plaintiff would not have been able to rely on the provisional award of damages of less than $25k. The fact that it took place within the context of the union's original intended purpose was to inform and inform members of the public about the union and their position within the organization and to provide them with the facts and data necessary to support their position. The defendant union published the same material on two occasions to members of public who could have no interest in the labour matters at issue. The defendants filed a statement of claim in that grievance and sought damages in the amount of $50,000. The parties to this grievance also brought an action in defamation against the Union and sought to recover damages of over $200,"
d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff, CN applied to the Court seeking orders that the defendants, Clarke Transport and Clarke Transport, answer certain questions which they refused to answer on discovery. The application raises interesting issues with respect to the proper scope of questioning or examination for discovery. HELD: 1) The Court found that when the Court moved from the words of touching and relating to any matter in issue, it intended to move away from the broad relevance test that existed under the former Queen's Bench Rules. 2) The application raised questions about the proper conduct of questioning and the extent to which certain information which are foundational to the expressed opinion can be found. 3) The history of some 445 cars previously loaded by Clarke is not pled as an issue. The Court determined that the company's request to search its own records and advise whether or not each of some some 445 railcars identified by CN as previously loaded as Clarke had in fact been loaded by the plaintiff is not within the proper Scope of questioning. The court ordered that the plaintiff answer all of the questions and provide proper answers. 4) The plaintiff was awarded costs of $1,500 to the cause."

Even if proven, the damages were part of urban life. The plaintiff claimed for injunctive relief ordering the trees to be removed. The Court had no jurisdiction to grant this relief. The amended claim could proceed limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees into the plaintiff’s property and whether the trees invaded the plaintiff’s air space.",The plaintiff sues the defendant and seeks portions of the defendant's action struck. The defendant contends that overhanging trees from the plaintiff's property onto the defendant property invade the plaintiff’s yard. The plaintiff argues that debris from trees falling from the defendant’llow and other debris from the plaintiffs’ yard invade the defendant yard. Both applications were successful and the parties are currently self-represented. The court reviewed the principles enunciated in the Small Claims Act and found that both the plaintiff and defendant”s claims were frivolous and vexatious. The claim for damages from overhangs trees on the defendant parent’d property was dismissed. The issue was whether the claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action. HELD: The plaintiff” s claim was struck. 1) The defendant“s claim was dismissed on the basis that the plaintiff failed to establish what can be regarded as a nuisance (i.e. an inconvenience materially interfering with the ordinary physical comfort of human existence) and that the claim did not disclose a reasonable Cause of Action. The Court was also prepared to strike the portion of the plaintiff who claimed damages from tree felling on his property. 2) The plaintiff was awarded costs.

The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","Continental Seafoods applied for a refund of health services tax paid on refrigeration equipment which was installed in a new facility for pickled whole herring. The contract contained stringent quality specifications. The refrigeration unit was used to cool the pickled herring in a cooler facility for 28 to 45 days at a strictly controlled temperature of 0ºC to 2ºC. The applicant argued that the tax should not have been apportioned based on the use of the refrigeration facility. The Provincial Tax Commissioner allowed the objection in part and indicated that rebate of $14,467.43 would be paid to Continental. The appellant contended that the Minister and the Commissioner were incorrect in not allowing the exemption for the refrigerated equipment in full. In issue was whether the tax paid should be refunded based upon the use or of the equipment in production. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the assessment for health services taxed was upheld. 1)In light of the recent changes in the legislation, it was appropriate to raise the new point of law in a different way than before. 2)The practice of apportionment of tax was not appropriate in this case. 3)The Provincial Tax Commission was not properly represented at the hearing. 4)The Court reviewed the history of the legislation and particularly s. 10(1)(h)(I) and (j) and its authorizations. 5)The province tax commissioner was incorrect in failing to allow the exemption in full for the equipment.

He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants. The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors. Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000. The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy. The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy. HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances. An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application. 2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. The onus will be on the bankrupt to comply with the requirements of the trustee to qualify for an automatic discharge on November 15/98 or an early discharge as provided for in s168.1(2).","The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy. Section 181 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act reads as ""(1) Where in the opinion of the court, a receiving order ought not to have been made on an assignment ought not have been filed, the court may by order annul the bankruptcy."" The bankrupt submits he received wrong legal advice concerning the status of the builders' lien claimants and secondly the undervaluation of his assets. HELD: The application by the bankrupt for an order annulling his assignment is dismissed. 1) An annulment of the assignment would be dangerous because it would result in the bankrupt being bankrupt for a period of time more expeditiously than it would otherwise take. Certain builders' liien claimants have already commenced an action. 2) The bankrupt has been far from a model bankrupt. He has yet to file monthly financial statements and has not made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. One of the conditions for the financing is that the bankrupt get out of bankruptcy. 3) There is likely merit to the bankrupt's contention that the bankruptcy proceedings have been of no value to him. It also appears from the facts that the majority of creditors, who are secured, would also benefit from the bankrupts request being granted. If the bankrupt were granted financing he would likely be far from model bankrupt but would have met the requirement to comply with his obligations. 4) The majority of the builder's lien claimant claimants have been pre-bankrupt and can pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds divided among theclaimants."

The issues before the court is interim custody and primary residence of the child, access by the other parent and interim child maintenance. The parties filed evidence that was considerably contradictory relating to each other and respective abilities as parent. viva voce hearing was held to assist determining the questions of credibility. The mother aged 31 years of age, is employed as secretary. The mother remained at home during the first year of the child's birth then returned to work. The mother suffered from post partum depression following the child's birth and as result attempted to commit suicide. She was hospitalized for three weeks to receive psychiatric assistance. The psychiatrist who treated the mother states the mother is unlikely to have future suicide attempts and has responded well to treatment. The child was with the mother every afternoon during her hospitalization and the mother bonded with her son. The father is currently employed at Ipsco on shift work and is currently living with his parents. The father has had the child since the separation and the child has had little access with his mother. HELD: The child's primary residence should be with the mother. Based on the information before the Court, the mother has always been the primary caregiver of the child and remained at home with the child for the first year of his life. The mother was responsible for the child's day to day needs, health care and child care. As well the father asserts that he was involved in the child's health care needs but was unable to name the child's pediatrician. The father will have access to the child for three days when he is not working including overnight access. The father's gross annual income is $48,897 which results in a payment to the mother for child maintenance in the sum of $393.00 payable on the first day of each and every month until further ordered by the Court. In addition the father will responsible for 75% of the child care expenses.","The parties sought interim custody of their 1 year old son. The respondent claimed that the respondent was clinically depressed and addicted to alcohol. She attempted to commit suicide two separate occasions following his birth. The petitioner alleged that the petitioner, who was an abusive man with an alcohol problem, was addicted to cocaine and had taken narcotics including crack cocaine. HELD: 1) The respondent was to have access to the respondent by appointment only for three days each week. The court reviewed the various circumstances surrounding the alleged attempt to commit the suicide and found that the appellant was capable of caring for the child who was not in the respondent's custody. 2) The petitioner was to pay the respondent $48,393.99 in monthly child care costs. 3) The court found that it was in the petitioner's best interests to be in the custody of the respondent to be kept in the current location. The child's psychological state was now stable and she was capable to care for her son. 4) The Court found that S.W.S. had taken steps to deal with her psychological and psychiatric difficulties. The Court ordered that the child's medical expenses be paid in accordance with the respondent child care expenses. 5) The child was to be cared for in the interim in the same location as the respondent."
e_1999canlii6888.txt,"The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales. The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by the defendant. The defendant had sold a number of dairy products prior to the 1988 quota scheme change. The three brothers each formed a new company at that time with the intention of transferring all three assets of their company to the defendant and having them each own a separate company. The purpose of the new company was to be more stable and more profitable. The court found that the agreement was not based on a quota system but on a real estate transaction. The agreement provided that the three brothers would have joint control of the dairy operation with the defendant, with the exception of one brother, and that the defendant would have the exclusive right to sell only the one product per quota. The plaintiff was to have his shares divided equally. The defendants refused to honour the agreement. The plaintiffs sought to have the agreement divided according to the value of the assets in the company and the defendant's proposed sale of the rest of the quota to the plaintiff. The Court found that both parties were in a conflict of interest and that it was improper for the defendant to divide the proceeds of the sale of one product in the first place. The provisions of the 1988 agreement were found to be in breach of the provisions of section 29 of the Trade Offering Act. Section 29 of The Trade Off Offering Agreement was found to have been breached by the plaintiff because the agreement referenced only one product and the words 'fluid milk Quota'. The agreement clearly stated that the two products were to be equally owned and the proceeds would be shared equally among the three. The terms of the 1989 agreement were not disclosed to the court."
e_1999skqb151.txt,"The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","The primary issue was whether the Agreement was a lease or a security agreement. The central issue was between the parties whether the agreement was a leasing or a Security agreement. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. The defendant was awarded costs on the basis of Column D of the Tariff of Costs. 1)The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively show that Mr. Poirier acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. The trade-in value was $23,650.00 being 25% of the agreed value as down payment and $23 in the amount of advance payment of $9,320.67 to be paid at the plaintiff's option if he elected to purchase the sprayers. 2)The trade-ins were not nominal amounts but the value of the trade- in did not equal the amount the advance payment and the difference being $679.33 was $10,000. 3)The termination value was not determined by the anticipated value of June 2002 but the trade in was 25% and the value would depend upon market fluctuations. The option payment of 23,650 did not appear to be a nominal amount but in the absence of evidence it was a deferred down payment. The difference being was $679 and the amount was $20,000 (between $10 and $9.33). 4)The Court must be able to ascertain the probable value of a sprayer at the end of the Agreement in June 2002 and in light of the evidence that it depends on market fluctuations, cannot determine whether the option price would be substantially less than the fair market value in June, 2002 or equivalent to it, or more. 5)The option payment was not a nominal sum but in absence of the absence evidence it would have been a substantial sum as being the test employed in the Ontario Equipment case. The Agreement does not determine the market value of your property at the beginning of a five year period by the terms of the agreement. 6)The defendant was to bear the risk of loss and obligations for maintenance and insurance. The agreement was not conditional. Case Credit's claim is barred by The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. 7)The court must be be able, in light as it depends upon market fluctuation, to ascertain at the final value of $23.650, whether the value at the termination value of an option payment is a substantial amount as being $94,600. The evidence is that the tradein as the advance payments are not a'substantial sum' as being a test employed by the Ontario case"
e_2000nsca53.txt,"The appellant and respondent lived together in common law relationship for approximately ten years. Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets. They separated in 1995. The appellant brought an application under s. 275 of the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of assets. She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship. The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect. This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter.","The appellant and the respondent lived together for ten years. They had two children out of this relationship. The respondent separated from the appellant in 1995. The appellant commenced an application under the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of the parties' assets. In conjunction with that application, the appellant sought a declaration that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is infringed by the definition of'spouse' in s. 2(g) of the MPA. The applicant argued that s.2(g] discriminates against her as a common law spouse on the basis of one or more personal characteristics. The parties lived together in a 'common law relationship' for tenyears. The petitioner obtained a cottage and cottage on a farm owned by the respondent. The couple moved to Nova Scotia after the 1995 marriage. The wife and child were living together for 10 years. The husband continued to live in the home. The application for a division of assets was dismissed. The court assumed the facts set out in their respective affidavits were analogous to those in the respondent's position and concluded that the appellant's s.15 Charter rights were infringed. The Court concluded that s2(G) of that Act applied to the appellant on the same basis as s. 15(1) of The Charter of rights and Freedom and concluded the respondent was entitled to equitable treatment based on one or less of the spouses' common characteristics. In this sense, the MAA did not violate the appellant’s s.16 Charter rights. The Act provided for equitable distribution of property among all persons. The evidence showed that the respondent had no claim to the land. The appellants’ claim for a separation of assets from the respondent based upon the respondent’ s.12(g)(iv) and mortgage on the property was dismissed by the court. The issue of the respondent and the appellant were not reconciled."
e_2005skqb263.txt,"Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","The accused was charged with second degree murder contrary to s. 235. The accused had been previously convicted of assault causing bodily harm and sexual assault. She also had skin on her arm and was found bound and sexually assaulted. The Crown sought to admit the two previous incidents of choking as similar fact evidence to prove issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The evidence is admissible on a principled basis, the principles of necessity and reliability are upheld, the trial judge must not encroach within the jury's domain and weigh the evidence in a limited manner and the evidence must be sufficiently connected to the issue in question as to be reasonably reliable to allow the trial to conclude that the evidence is not tainted with collusion. The evidence must not be tainted with conspiracy or fraud. 1) The Court must not invade the province of a trier of fact and condition admissibility on whether the evidence will ultimately reliable. However, it will need to examine whether the circumstances in which the statement was made lend sufficient credibility to allow a finding of threshold reliability. 2) The evidence of similar fact activity is presumptively inadmissible and it creates a heavy onus on the trial court to determine the admissiblilty of the evidence. The prejudicial nature of the similar factevidence has not been overcome by its probative value and it should not be admitted in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial."
e_2007skqb225.txt,"The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived. The appeal is made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The imposition of a victim fine surcharge under s. 737 of the code is mandatory subject only to an application under s. 737(5) relating to undue hardship. If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim surcharge, it is also mandatory that the Court give reasons. The sentence is varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $30.","The Crown appealed the sentence of $200.00 for breach of probation and a $30 victim surcharge. The sentence was reduced to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim surcharges in the amount of $30. The sentencing judge waived the surcharge on the basis that the respondent had not requested an exemption pursuant to s. 737(5) of the Code. HELD: The sentence is varied to include a order requiring that the Respondent to pay the victim surcharged in the order of $ 30. The surcharge was waived notwithstanding that the defendant had not sought an exemption under s. 730 of the Criminal Code (the 'Code'). If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim fee, it is also mandatory that the court give reasons. The maximum sentence for breaches of s. 687 is 15 years imprisonment. The Crown has consistently employed the maximum amount of surcharges to play an important part in the criminal justice system. The trial judge raised an important issue in the context of undue hardship which is why the surcharges are so frequently raised in the sentencing process. This is particularly true where the defendant has not paid a victim fee in accordance with the maximum surcharge imposed. The victim surcharging is also a mandatory part of the sentence in circumstances where the judge has consistently raised the maximum allowable surcharges by the court."
e_2007skqb367.txt,"The plaintiff is an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Union. He commenced this claim based on the Indemnity Clause contained in the Union's bylaws. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the union for breach of its by-laws and alleged breach of contract by the union in violating hiring hall rules. The union resisted the claim and brought an application for summary judgment. HELD: The Court has jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff's claim and his application under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgement. 1) The dispute in the Fourth Action involves a contractual debate concerning the meaning and scope of an indemnity clause. This is substantially different from an internecine dispute in a voluntary sports organization respecting the disciplining of high school coach over recruiting practices. Nothing in the Union by-law precludes the plaintiff from seeking relief from the Courts before making a final appeal to the CUPE National office. 2) The essential nature of the debate between the union and the officer is a contractual dispute. This reflects the essence of the union's by-laws. The essential character of the dispute is that the plaintiff is entitled to the benefits of the indemnity by-loan in the union by-lamented by the officer. Nothing within the Union's by laws precludes him from seeking assistance from the Court before making his final appeal. 3) In the absence of a statutory regime precluding the Court's involvement, the debate in the fourth action is totally appropriate for disposition by the Court."
e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children (ages twelve and ten). The respondent applied to vary the period of retroactive child support to reflect his actual income, which was greater than the respondent's s.7 expenses for the younger child. The respondent argued that although he did not receive formal notice of the petitioner's application until October 2008, his counsel did not get the relevant documents until October 8, 2008 and the retroactive recalculation should be limited to three years prior to October 9, 2008. The petitioner also claimed that the respondent should have made more informed decisions about his/her support obligations. The court did not have jurisdiction to consider the application of the respondent for retroactive variation of child support and a readjustment of the claim for section 7 expenses pertaining to the parties' older child."
e_2009skca138.txt,"This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed.","The appellant company appealed a decision of the city assessessor, pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act, that the city had misapplied or misconstrued the importance of the sale of a shopping mall. The city had assessed the mall based on its fair value as determined by the city. The assessment of the mall came to rest on the city's determination of its fair valued, which in turn came to be based on the sale price determined by city assessors using the software used in the calculation of the MAF. The company argued the Committee erred in law in upholding the city’s decision to include the mall in its array of sales, especially in light of the removal of the sales of four other shopping malls, including the Northgate Mall, Southland Mall and Victoria Square Mall. The latter mall was transferred to the appellant company for the purpose of assessing the mall. It claimed the sale was not an arm’ve length sale but rather a portfolio sales. The court reviewed the various sales of the shopping mall and found that the sales all fell within the range of acceptable sales for assessment purposes. The assessor, acting on the authority of s. 171 and 172 of The Cities Act, concluded that the sale, contrary to what the Committee made of it, did not amount to an arm-s length sale because the appellant was not a willing buyer and, in fact, preferred not to purchase an interest in only the two enclosed shopping malls. The sale price did not require any adjustments to the sales price. The committee found that it was not in error to consider the sale sale price of the Northland Mall as an arm's length sale, even though the sale involved only 50% interest. The issue was whether the Committee’d been negligent in considering the sale’e value of the property. The only thing that could have been said was that the Committee had been negligent was that there was no material error on the part of the Committee as it did not consider the sales in the previous two sales."

The plaintiffs claim that Paxil is ineffective and harmful to persons under 18 years of age.

HELD: The decisions reviewed by the Court all support the view that leave to cross-examine under Rule 317 is granted more readily in proposed class actions than it is in other civil proceedings. None support the proposition that proposed representative plaintiff is immune from cross-examination in respect of his or her individual claim. Cross-examination of proposed representative plaintiff may explore matters pertaining to his or her individual claim in the context of issue that must be determined by the court pursuant to s. and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act.

The court ordered that the procedure at trial would be the procedure for a simplified trial as set out in Saskatchewan, Court of Queen's Bench Rules, rule 494. The cost of repair was slightly less than the cost quoted by the plaintiff for the job. The plaintiffs claim is dismissed. The Court found that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that, therefore, there has been a breach. The contractor's failure to install proper capping and to properly caulk and lock the sofitting appeared to be critical for proper drainage of water from the garage. The quality of the installation was of such a standard as to amount to poor workmanship. The Plaintiff's claim is also dismissed."
e_2012skca69.txt,"The applicant applied for judicial interim release under s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed.","The accused applies for judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. The accused was a Roma and Romanian national who had resided in Canada since his arrival here exactly eight years ago. In 2002, the accused was killed when his car struck and killed a pedestrian in Romania. The victim, a Romanian national, was later apprehended and he admitted consuming alcohol and striking the victim. The defendant was later charged with criminally negligent homicide and leaving the scene of an accident. The Court found that the accused had not committed any wrongs and, although he had been detained by Canadian authorities for approximately 7 weeks, he had not shown that he was fleeing Romania to seek refugee protection. The application for judicial inter-arrival was dismissed on the basis that the Court could not determine that the sureties proffered by the accused were not frivolous. The fact that the defendant had no real property and had identified no significant activities that connected him to the jurisdiction where he resided was not an issue. The court found that it would be non-sensical for the accused not to be returned to Romania given the current circumstances. The issue of the accused's non-appearance was also raised. The appellant's application for interim judicial release was also dismissed. The issues before the Court were: 1) the accused should not be extradited; 2) the Court must determine whether the accused has met the low threshold for non- reappearance that must be met in extradition proceedings; and 3) the onus must be placed on the accused to establish his bona fides. The most recent decision in Németh v. Canada (Justice), 2010 SCC 56 (CanLII), leads one to the conclusion that Canada's legal obligations under the Convention with respect to non-refoulement displace the limiting effect of its legal obligations as a result of his conviction in that country for criminally negligent negligence; 4) the issue of costs should be considered in the application for bail. The appeal of the conviction was dismissed."

The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person. The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone. The mitigating factors were that the accused pled guilty and expressed profound remorse. He had not been drinking and had a clear driving record. The accused was at low risk to re-offend.","The accused was charged with three counts of dangerous driving, one of which was causing the death of his three young boys. The accused was convicted of operating a motor vehicle in a manner that was dangerous to the public and causing the loss of three of the boys. He was sentenced to six years imprisonment, with the rest to be dealt with in the amount of 10 years.

The sentences were to be determined in accordance with the objectives and principles of sentencing contained within the Criminal Code."
