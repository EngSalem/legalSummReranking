The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1.

These packages are sold to customers across Canada and around the world. The defendants suggest that once forest product is harvested and the dues and fees paid, they are no longer forest products and are thus no longer governed by provincial legislation.

Given this definition it is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the company that included cutting the logs were specifically taken to prepare them for the log home market. These steps may not be significant but the process utilized by the corporation is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. The creation of a chisum log is processing and must require a Forestry Product Processing Facility Licence.

The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that Chisum requires such a licence. These steps may not be significant but I am satisfied that the process utilized by P & E is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. I am also satisfied that Chisum took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. I find that paragraph 5 of P-1 clearly establishes the steps taken by Chisum, including debarking, were steps taken in the manufacturing of a forest product for market.

The Court held that the defendants were involved in the manufacture of the forest product for the log home industry and that the creation of the chisum log was a processing and must require a processing license. The accused were found to have entered into an agreement to supply the defendant with the necessary materials and equipment to process the logs.

I am also satisfied that Chisum took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. I find that paragraph 5 of P-1 clearly establishes the steps taken by Chisum, including debarking, were steps taken in the manufacturing of a forest product for market. I have therefore concluded that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. CONCLUSION [29] I therefore find Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. and Garry Varga guilty of violating s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1.",0.4530386740331492,0.6701164294954722,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1. The defendant was the President and sole Director of the company. The company assembles log home packages in the Weyakwin district north of Prince Albert. These packages are sold to customers across Canada and around the world. The defendants suggest that once forest product is harvested and the dues and fees paid, they are no longer forest products and are thus no longer governed by provincial legislation. HELD: 1) The definition of “manufacture” in the Act is extremely broad as it says “any step taken”. Given this definition it is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the president and sole director that included cutting the logs were specifically taken to prepare them for the log home market. These steps may not be significant but the process utilized by the company is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. The creation of a chisum log is processing and must require a Forestry Product Processing Facility Licence. The process detailed in P-1 encompassed the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the loghome industry. 2) The accused were found guilty of violating the Act by failing to obtain a processing licence. The requirement for processing facility licence was restricted so that it did not apply to every entity that manufactures forest product. The nature of the business as noted in the corporate registry is logging, manufacturing building products. There is a two tiered system of processing facilities, those that process product originating from Crown Forest Land and those that only process product from private land. 3) The Court of Queen’s Bench decision in R. v. Provincial Forest Products established that the defendant was in the manufacture of forest products within the meaning of the Act. The fact that the accused met their obligations under the Act did not create an absurdity in that: one, it would require any manufacturer, at any point in the market chain, to obtain processing licence for any processing of product that had as its point of origin, Crown forest Land; and two, it creates a two-tiered system. The accused did not have a processing license.","[1] The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. (referred to as “Chisum”) and Garry Varga (referred to as “Varga”) are charged as follows:

At the beginning of the investigation, the respondent was given certain 'can say' statements by former residents of the institutions which outlined certain allegations made against him. The respondent later appealed the refusal of the disclosure sought. The appellant argued that he had been aware of the allegations and knew of the Stratton Inquiry and the findings of that inquiry. He also argued that the respondent had been misleading and had failed to disclose important information about his background, work and employment history.

It was important to maintain the confidentiality of all of the information that was exchanged, especially regarding the credibility of claims made against the respondent. The integrity of the process was at the forefront of the decision-making process. 4)The respondent was intimately familiar with the investigation and protection of privacy provisions in the Act. He had been intimately involved in the creation and execution of several of the investigative reports that were made as part of that investigation. The extent to which certain investigative reports and statements could be put to the benefit of the administration was also discussed. 5)There were numerous errors and omissions by the respondent in the investigation of these matters. The errors were inexcusable and should be set aside for the purposes of the proper investigation.  6)A review officer was appointed by the Minister of Justice to review and modify the compensation process. He reviewed the entire scope of the inquiry and found that most of the recommendations made by the inspector were completely and totally false. The recommendations were based on the totality of the evidence obtained as a result of the independent investigation into the systemic sexual and physical abuse in the institutions. The process was transparent and effective in allowing the respondent to participate and to minimize the impact on other claimants.

The tenant denies any negligence, contending the cause is normal wear and tear or high humidity arising from water entering the building due to inherent structural defects for which the landlord is responsible. The defendant sold the building to the tenant at the time of the lease, retaining the exclusive use of a portion of the basement under the lease. The tenants purchased the building from the landlord in 2008 and retained it for seven years. In the spring following purchase, the tenant visited the restaurant. There, water leaked into the premises from the roof, damaged ceiling, flooded the restaurant for several days and the tenant notified the landlord about the problem. The floor is always clean and well maintained. Only a small part of the moisture entering into the building is due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor. Leaking of water through the ceiling did necessitate closure of the restaurant, causing reduction of customers who could reasonably be expected to be put off by the unsightly ceiling and floor tiles, and deterioration of the vinyl floor tiles could be attributed to poor maintenance lack of sufficient polish and waxing.

The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor. The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years. As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800. Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836. The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500.","The plaintiff landlord claims damages against its tenant, the defendant, asserting negligence by failing to clean, wax and polish the vinyl tile floor in the building, thereby permitting moisture to penetrate between and underneath the tiles resulting in lifting and cracking.

The damage to the floor is $22,281 and the tenant is contributorily negligent to the extent of 25% of the damage. Leaking of water through the ceiling, sagging ceiling tiles, and deterioration of the vinyl floor tiles could be attributed to poor maintenance of polish and waxing. The floor has a lifespan of 20 years if regularly maintained by polishing, waxing and polishing. Moisture entering the building from the roof and outside walls are 5 times in excess of standard reading for normal building samples and are due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor.","[1] The plaintiff, the landlord, claims damages against its tenant, the defendant, asserting negligence by failing to clean, wax and polish the vinyl tile floor in the building, thereby permitting moisture to penetrate between and underneath the tiles resulting in lifting and cracking. The tenant denies responsibility, contending the cause is normal wear and tear or high humidity arising from water entering the building due to inherent structural defects for which the landlord is responsible. The tenant asserts that the landlord breached the lease by failing to repair the roof and by failing to take other remedial measures to prevent water from infiltrating the building, resulting in losses to the tenant’s restaurant operating in the building. The tenant also claims damages for economic interference, alleging the landlord interfered with the sale of its restaurant. The landlord claims damages in the amount of $22,533 to repair the two bad areas of the restaurant floor. [18] The evidence does show that a part, but only a part, of the moisture entering into the subfloor was due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor. I accept that the damage to the floor is $22,281, and I find that the tenant is contributorily negligent to the extent of 25% of the damage. I find the only business loss proven by the tenant for which the landlord is responsible to be $4,800.

The tenant denies any negligence, contending the cause is normal wear and tear or high humidity arising from water entering the building due to inherent structural defects for which the landlord is responsible. The defendant sold the building to the tenant at the time of the lease, retaining the exclusive use of a portion of the basement under the lease. The tenants purchased the building from the landlord in 2008 and retained it for seven years. In the spring following purchase, the tenant visited the restaurant. There, water leaked into the premises from the roof, damaged ceiling, flooded the restaurant for several days and the tenant notified the landlord about the problem. The floor is always clean and well maintained. Only a small part of the moisture entering into the building is due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor. Leaking of water through the ceiling did necessitate closure of the restaurant, causing reduction of customers who could reasonably be expected to be put off by the unsightly ceiling and floor tiles, and deterioration of the vinyl floor tiles could be attributed to poor maintenance lack of sufficient polish and waxing. The evidence does show that a part, but only part, of moisture entering the subfloor was due to negligent negligence by the tenant.

The installation and maintenance of the floor in 2001 was of the view that water in the basement could cause the problem with the tiles but did not test for moisture or humidity levels within the building material, nor did he test the ceiling.",0.37593984962406013

The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies.

I agree. They are struck.,0.14479638009049772,0.5370675453047776,"FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty. In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.  1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure. 2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.  3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence. It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt. His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","FIAT.

He had obtained his A-1 driver’s licence in 2009 and had clean driving abstract. He was married and had three children. He had recently been diagnosed with mild sleep apnea. He expressed remorse to the victim’s families and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.| HELD: The accused was sentenced to three years in imprisonment on the first count and three years concurrent for the second and third counts, and one year concurrent to the other counts on the fourth count. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment. The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person. The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone.

[17] Normand is extremely remorseful for the catastrophic situation he has caused as a result of his unexplained inattentiveness. [35] In addition, Normand Lavoie’s unlawful conduct must be denounced. The aggravating factors include:
(a) by far the most aggravating factor is the death of three innocent teenagers and the serious injury of a fourth person, a 22‑year‑old flag person;
(b) the devastating impact the death of these three teenage boys has had on their families;
(c) Normand Lavoie was a professional driver and, thus, capable of exercising more skill and vigilance;
(d) the fact that a larger, heavier vehicle was involved, requiring more care; and
(e) the accident occurred within a construction zone. [56] The mitigating factors include:
(a) Normand Lavoie consented to his committal to trial in Queen’s Bench and pled guilty, accepting full responsibility for this horrific accident;
(b) Normand Lavoie’s sincere and profound remorse;
(c) alcohol and/or drugs were not a factor in this accident;
(d) Normand Lavoie had a clear driving abstract for driving offences and a dated minimal criminal record;
(e) Normand Lavoie is a low risk to re‑offend in the future; and
(f) Normand Lavoie has the continued support of his family and community.

[61] As to Count No. 2, being dangerous driving causing the death of Carter Stevenson, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of three years to be served in a federal institution concurrent to Count No. 1. [62] As to Count No. 3, being dangerous driving causing the death of Kristian Skalicky, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of three years to be served in a federal institution concurrent to Count No. 1 and Count No. 2.

You shall be prohibited for ten years from your release from prison of possession of any firearm, other than a prohibited firearm or restricted firearm, and any cross‑bow, restricted weapon, ammunition and explosive substance.

The accused was convicted of operating a motor vehicle in a manner that was dangerous to the public and caused the death of three young boys. The impact on the three boys was so severe that one of the boys, who was standing near the driver's side of the vehicle, suffered a broken collarbone, a broken left collarbone and a fractured left humerus. He also suffered from short-term and long-term memory issues. The three boys' names were on the victim impact statements and the accused was sentenced to six years imprisonment. The Court was satisfied that the accused had not only travelled on Highway No. in Saskatchewan before May 3, 2015 and in particular, through the construction zone south of Spalding, but also had driven through a construction zone several times. HELD: The Court ordered a sentence of six years in federal institution, plus a nine year driving prohibition and a $1,000 victim surcharge.  1)The Court was totally satisfied that it had sufficiently heard from the victims in this matter. The defendant's criminal record was marked as Exhibit P2. There was only one conviction for driving with more than 80 mgs of alcohol in his blood and he had no previous driving offences other than the.08 obtained sixteen years earlier. 2)There was no evidence as to what activity was taking place in the construction zones other than those six signs within the first 600 metres of construction zone to the accident scene 1.6 kilometres into the highway.  3)The accused's unlawful conduct must be denounced. He failed to recognize the stopped vehicles, to allow sufficient distance to bring his vehicle to safe stop before colliding with the rear of his vehicle.  4)The aggravating and mitigating factors as outlined in s.718.2 of the Criminal Code were appropriate but not sufficient to indicate fatigue. The totality principle must also be applied by the Court in determining what the ultimate sentence should be for the accused.  5)Individual sentences of less than 6 years were imposed for dangerous driving causing death and causing bodily harm.  6)The sentences imposed were based on the facts as contained in the Agreed Statement of Facts and the pre-sentence report filed with the Court. Section 722(1) of the Code provides: A)a) the principles of sentencing as contained within the Code. B) the test results were in accordance with the objectives and principles of",0.5089514066496164

Ltd. pursuant to the June 5, 2001 writ of execution. The solicitor's lien arises out of s. 66(3) of The Legal Profession Act, 1990. The sheriff has the power to seize and sell the shares in the name of Jensen. He has not pledged, hypothecated, sold or encumbered the said share certificate which would require them to be delivered to any third party in accordance with any obligations or encumbrances he may have placed against the same company. There is no restriction in the Executions Act nor in the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The only claim against the shares within the company is the plaintiff's claim as creditor. It is on this principle that the solicitor has a lien as a creditor. In this case, the argument that the receiver cannot have rights greater than those of the client vis-à-vis the solicitor cannot be sustained. The claim for lien is not made out. HELD: The court held that the end result of the seizure and sale of Jensen's shares will be sale of farm lands. That leave of the court must be obtained. The court declined to refuse the shares to the receiver. 1) The solicitor has no better right to retain documents than his client would have if they were still in possession of them. He knows of no legal obligation between himself and the plaintiff whereby he is required to deliver up to the plaintiff his Class 'A' Common, voting shares. 2) The portion of the affidavit that was used to determine the amount owing by the plaintiff was uncontroverted. There was nothing before the court that even remotely suggests that the client is not not the owner of the shares. The defendant has no greater right to refuse production and delivery of documents than is his client's when faced with the right of third party to require production of the documents. 3) The court did not consider a valid solicitor’s lien to have been made out on the part of the applicant.","[1] ACS seeks an order from this court requiring the legal office of Eggum, Abrametz and Eggum to produce to the sheriff of the Judicial Centre of Prince Albert, the shares owned by Barry Jensen in Jen-Sim Cattle Co.

The original transaction between the School Division and the Flads was not concluded in an effort to avoid compliance with subdivision regulations, rather it was made in the mistaken belief that an already subdivided parcel was being transferred. The Court was obliged to prevent such wholesale frustration of the legislature's objects. 2) While the Court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders, the Court was able to direct the trial of an issue where the facts are not in dispute (ie. there is no question of the right of the applicant with no reservation of his rights) and resolution of the matter could be achieved in minutes or hours. 3) The application for a writ of mandamus was granted on the facts of the case but after a full hearing at trial as opposed to the summary fashion in which the order was requested in the present case.

The applicant asks for an order directing the Registrar of Titles to register the Plan of Proposed Subdivision with respect to Parcel G and to issue a Transform Approval Certificate. The requested relief cannot be provided unless the Court has authority to order a subdivision of land outside the requirements of the Planning and Development Act, 1983. The issue arises in a rather complex fact situation. In 1994, the School Division's predecessor (the Kerrobert School Division) sold land to purchasers (the Flads). The transfer was registered, however the reservation of the farm site could not be registered because it purported to effect an unauthorized subdivision of the land. The Flads filed a caveat to protect their interest. The trial judge ordered rectification of the agreements and directed the defendants to apply for subdivision approval. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The orders made in the foregoing cases can only be determined on a full examination of the evidence and not in summary fashion. The Court was obliged to prevent such wholesale frustration of the legislature's objects. The original transaction appeared to have been concluded in an effort to avoid compliance with subdivision regulations, rather it was made in a mistaken belief that an already subdivided parcel was being transferred. As the school division and the Episcopal Corporation were in occupation of the proposed parcel, they failed to obtain development permits before making improvements to the site. The subsequent difficulties were of their own making and not solely ascribable to the mistakes of title. However, it is not within the Court's power to order the Registrar to effect subdivision contrary to the provisions of The Improvements Under the Mistake of Title Act. The application in question was whether the Flads retained a legal interest in the land which could form the basis of a registrable transfer under The Land Titles Act.","[1] The applicant, Landswest School Division No. 123, asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land (proposed Parcel G) located within the SW 15-37-28 W3M owned by the respondent, Neil Klein.

The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings.

The appellant and the respondent placed a $75,000 second mortgage on property owned by the company. The second mortgage was made payable to the appellant and Mrs. Gordon and drawn on the Bank of Montreal. In August 1995 the appellant initiated this action against the respondent banks. The respondents applied to strike the statement of claim on the basis that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action or, alternatively, for an Order striking the Statement of claim as being barred by the Limitation of Actions Act.

b_2011nsca39.txt,"The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant.

b_2008skqb182.txt,"The tenant appeals the decision of the Hearing Officer granting her landlord a possession order of her rental premises. The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process. The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","The tenant appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer granting the landlord possession of her rental premises. This self-represented tenant included, as grounds of her appeal, 'procedural violations' and'misinformation as to the purpose of the hearing'. HELD: The appeal is allowed. 1) The three days notice given to the tenant was insufficient to allow her to make arrangements to personally attend the hearing. 2) The Hearing Officer, in accepting this 'boyfriend related evidence' when neither the Hearing Notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rules of natural justice and due process. The tenant could not have had notice of the nature and extent of the disturbance and damage allegations made related to her boyfriend nor would she have had any opportunity to respond to those allegations. 3) The hearing notice was properly served personally and the tenant did not appear. No notice or warning was needed to proceed to the hearing or for the tenant to vacate the premises. 4) In these circumstances, the tenant's request for an adjournment was not properly considered by the hearing officer. The disregard of the tenant’s request for a further hearing was unreasonable and inconsistent with the principle of access to justice that must guide judges and administrative tribunals alike in the conduct of their hearings. 5) The tenants’ right to complaint was violated. 6) The court found that both the failure to properly consider and grant the tenant the applied for adjournment in the particular circumstances of this case and failure to provide the tenant with the particulars of her claim constitute reversible error. 7) The tenant was advised of the difficulty in arranging for a new hearing and of the costs associated with it.","[1] The tenant Geneviève Clouâtre appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer rendered March 11, 2008 granting the landlord Art Hosie possession of her rental premises at suite “B”, 1909 Reynolds Street, Regina.

4_2004skqb19.txt,"The applicant applied by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents, Zurich and Sovereign, were obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against the applicant. The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident.

The respondents take the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend (and to pay defence costs) for the claims brought against Westridge and others in the underlying action. HELD: 1) The applicant's legal allegations are properly pleaded. In doing so, courts are not bound by the legal labels chosen by the plaintiff. The plaintiff cannot change an intentional tort into a negligent one simply by choice of words or vice versa. 2) The defendant has a duty to defend because the exclusion clause does not apply. 3) The defendants are negligent and breach the contractual and other duties owed by the insurer. The mere fact that Genex alleges both negligence and a breach of contract is of no moment sufficient to cause the insurer to provide defence. The insurer must look beyond the choice of labels and examine the substance of the allegations contained in the pleadings. This does not involve deciding whether the claims have any merit; all court must do is decide, based on the true nature of the claims. 4) The soverign policy is a three step process.

The applicant takes the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend and to pay defence costs for the claims brought against Westridge and others in the underlying action. HELD: 1) The first premise for assessing whether an insurer's duty to defend has been triggered rests in the traditional 'pleadings rule'. Whether an insurer is bound to defend it has been conventionally addressed by relying on the allegations made in the pleadings filed against the applicant. 2) The mere fact that Genex alleges both negligence and a breach of contract is of no moment sufficient to change a claim by reason of an exclusion under the policy. 3) The second premise is to determine whether the statements of claim is properly pleaded. The onus of establishing that the terms of the policy obligate the insurer to defend rests with the applicant, not the insurer. 4) The third principle is articulated in Alie v. Bertrand Frère Construction Co. (2002), 222 D.L.R. (4th) 687, where Wallace J. stated that it is only in the nature of a pleadings that the insurer becomes legally obligated to protect. It is only where there is genuine ambiguity or doubt as to the claim that is resolved in favour of the insured. 5) Occurrence 'Occurrence' includes continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which result in loss neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the Insured.

The plaintiff cannot change an intentional tort into a negligent one simply by choice of words or vice versa. The second principle is summarized in Bacon v. McBride (1984), 62 O.R.(3d) 551.

1998canlii13585.txt,FIAT. Exclusive possesson and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner in May 1998. At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home. Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home. He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98. In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15. HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court. No case law could be found in support of either party. It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.,"FIAT. The parties were married for over 25 years and were now senior citizens. The petitioner sought an order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home. The court did not specify a date for the petitioner to move from the home.

That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","The respondent is the owner of land located within the Rural Municipality of Edenwold No. 158. It was granted an order (2014) requiring the respondent to comply with the February 3, 2014 order. The development officer of the RM applied for an order declaring the respondent in contempt of court for his failure to comply (dismissal of equipment, breach of zoning order); and for solicitor and client costs. The respondent contends that he has not complied with the orders nor has he done as much as he can to comply. HELD: The application for the contempt order is granted and the matter is adjourned to February 2, 2015. The court is satisfied that this is a situation that calls for a complete or near complete 'indemnification for costs reasonably incurred' by the respondent. Significant additional costs may be incurred by the RM and added to the tax rolls for Parcel A and became payable by the Schmidt if he does not purge his contempt within the time allotted by the court and before the RM moves to remove the offending equipment from the property.  1) Contempt proceedings are not for punishment per se, but for upholding the rule of law and respect for court orders. 2) The Court is concerned that any additional financial sanction may be more akin to punishment and may cause severe hardship to the Schmidt. 3) In this case, the respondent has clearly not liked how the Zoning Bylaw impacts his personal interests and he has therefore chosen not to complywith it.","[12] The RM asks the court to:

The husband is to be responsible for the matrimonial debts, with the net proceeds from the sale of matrimonial home to be paid ratably to those creditors; the wife is to receive 35% of the husband's pension entitlement; husband to pay spousal support in the amount of $1,000 per month for a period of ten years with the order open to variation if the wife obtains a C.P.P. disability pension or becomes fit to work or if the husband retires from the military or makes a proposal or an assignment in bankruptcy which has the effect of requiring the wife to pay any of the matrimonial debts.","The petitioner was awarded a divorce under s. 8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. The issues were the division of matrimonial assets and liabilities, whether the petitioner is entitled to spousal support and, if so, in what quantum.HELD: The court held that the pension of one spouse was valid and that it would be unfair or unconscionable to divide the pension such as it was during the cohabitation.

The respondent objected to the application being brought on behalf of the estate as Olson was neither executrix nor a beneficiary under the Will. The Will had not been admitted to probate. The respondent had divorced testator in 1972 and was granted child support of $60 per month and monthly spousal support of $40. The applicant who cohabited with the deceased since 1978 transferred her home to him in 1980 as joint tenants and he transferred his two and one-half quarter sections of farm land to the applicant.

8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).","The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking. He was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused had a long record of offences, including eight weapons related offences, four break and enter, one of which was aggravated assault (s. 145(3) of the Code), and one of several break and enters (museums). The Crown called expert evidence about street gangs and gang activity in the prison. There was evidence from the correction workers employed at the prison where the accused worked. At the prison, the accused was given a four-hour pass to work on a potato farm. He did not return within the time frame and was arrested at 11:00 p.m. that day. HELD: The Court held the predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the criminal Code. The Court found that the accused's actions were not premeditated and were of limited duration as shown on the video surveillance DVD. The evidence did not meet the statutory requirements for imprisonment. A long term offender order was imposed for the accused who was between the ages of fifteen and twenty-three years. The sentences were to be staggered and include periods of detention in the penitentiary. The predicate offence, aggravated assault, was to be sentenced to a term not exceeding fourteen years.","[1] On November 9, 2010 after trial, I found the accused, Michael Gamble, guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking contrary to s. 145(3) of the Criminal Code.

R. 311 (Q.B.), I found that Mr. Gamble stabbed the victim, Wesley Delaronde, several times on the right side of his mid-section with a knife. [18] Given the conviction and the Criminal Code provisions for imprisonment, I am satisfied that the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. Sentenced to six months secure custody and three months supervision in the community followed by one year probation. Sentence twelve months custody followed by six months supervision in the community. Sentence concurrent sentence of twenty-one months custody and supervision, twelve months secure custody followed by two months of open custody followed by seven month supervision in the community. [59] The similarities of the violent offences are as follows:
1) He had been under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time;


2) He committed the violent offences while under supervision under court orders in the community;
3) While carrying out the violent offences, he used or had in his possession a knife;
4) Most of the violent offences were as a result with his affiliation with the Indian Posse. [60] On a review of the circumstances of each of the six violent offences, including a review of the trial decisions, I am satisfied that the Crown has proven a pattern of repetitive behavior within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). I therefore find that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Gamble constitutes a threat to the life, safety, physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753.(1)(a)(i) and I find him a dangerous offender. The evidence is that Mr. Gamble has not had any intensive programming that is available at a federal institution. Also of significance is his youthful age and Foss indicated that young individuals on their first admission to a penitentiary are more likely to leave a gang. [67] I am satisfied, when one considers all the factors, that there is a reasonable expectation that a determinate sentence followed by a lengthy period of supervision will adequately protect the public. [79] I am satisfied given the accused’s record as an adult and as a young offender plus the circumstances of the unprovoked attack by Gamble on the victim in this instance that an appropriate sentence is six years or seventy-two months. He is entitled to a one for one credit for remand time for a credit of twenty-six months. I therefore sentence the accused as follows:
a) To forty-six months in a federal penitentiary;
b) To an order under s. 753.(4)(b) of the Criminal Code that Mr. Gamble be supervised in the community for a period of nine years from the date of his release;",0.3811944091486658,0.4281767955801105,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section.

Sentence concurrent sentence of twenty-one months custody and supervision, twelve months secure custody followed by two months of open custody followed by seven month supervision in the community. [59] The similarities of the violent offences are as follows:
1) He had been under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time;


2) He committed the violent offences while under supervision under court orders in the community;
3) While carrying out the violent offences, he used or had in his possession a knife;
4) Most of the violent offences were as a result with his affiliation with the Indian Posse. [60] On a review of the circumstances of each of the six violent offences, including a review of the trial decisions, I am satisfied that the Crown has proven a pattern of repetitive behavior within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). I therefore find that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Gamble constitutes a threat to the life, safety, physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753.(1)(a)(i) and I find him a dangerous offender. The evidence is that Mr. Gamble has not had any intensive programming that is available at a federal institution. Also of significance is his youthful age and Foss indicated that young individuals on their first admission to a penitentiary are more likely to leave a gang. [67] I am satisfied, when one considers all the factors, that there is a reasonable expectation that a determinate sentence followed by a lengthy period of supervision will adequately protect the public. [79] I am satisfied given the accused’s record as an adult and as a young offender plus the circumstances of the unprovoked attack by Gamble on the victim in this instance that an appropriate sentence is six years or seventy-two months. He is entitled to a one for one credit for remand time for a credit of twenty-six months. I therefore sentence the accused as follows:
a) To forty-six months in a federal penitentiary;
b) To an order under s. 753.(4)(b) of the Criminal Code that Mr. Gamble be supervised in the community for a period of nine years from the date of his release;",0.31332357247437775,0.3419354838709677,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).","The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking. He was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused had a long record of offences, including eight weapons related offences, four break and enter, one of which was aggravated assault (s. 145(3) of the Code), and one of several break and enters (misdemeanors). The Crown called expert evidence about street gangs and gang activity in the prison. There was evidence from the correction workers employed at the prison where the accused worked. HELD: The Court held the predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the criminal Code. The Court found that the accused should be found dangerous offender within s.753(1)(a)(i) and he should be sentenced to a term not exceeding fourteen years. Given the conviction and Criminal Code provisions for imprisonment, the Court was satisfied that the predicate offences were serious personal injuries offences. The offender had a lengthy record as a result of the offences committed.","[1] On November 9, 2010 after trial, I found the accused, Michael Gamble, guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking contrary to s. 145(3) of the Criminal Code. The Crown then applied to have Mr. Gamble declared a dangerous offender. [17] In my judgment of November 9, 2010 reported as R. v. Gamble, 2010 SKQB 414 (CanLII), 363 Sask. R. 311 (Q.B.), I found that Mr. Gamble stabbed the victim, Wesley Delaronde, several times on the right side of his mid-section with a knife. [18] Given the conviction and the Criminal Code provisions for imprisonment, I am satisfied that the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. Sentenced to six months secure custody and three months supervision in the community followed by one year probation.

It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute.

5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","The plaintiff and defendant, both farmers, became involved in a lawsuit regarding the sale of three quarters of land owned by the respondent. The defendant listed his farmland for sale on an online auction platform. The respondent listed his land in an attempt to create an open bidding system to allow farmers to explore the market but not necessarily conclude with sale of the land. The issue in this lawsuit is the application of the Statute of Frauds to the land sale agreement. HELD: The plaintiff must prove on a balance of probabilities that a contract was created between the respondent and the respondent respecting the Subject Quarters and that the formalities of the statute of frauds have been satisfied. Proof of damages will follow if the court finds that an agreement was created.  1) By inquiring into the words used by Mr. Petrie and Mr. Ziola and their interaction through the bidding and post-bidding process, the court is not opening the door to considering evidence of what was actually going on in these men's minds. 2) In the first telephone conversation, the plaintiff registered for a Farmers Post account. The second telephone conversation was only brief minutes, probably even seconds in duration. The conversations are all that possibly created a contract of purchase and purchase of farm property.  3) The central issue in the contract of acquisition and purchase is the requirement of writing under the Statutes. The essential elements of a valid contract are the essential elements that make it work, whether the agreement was enforceable, whether there was a consensus among the parties, and whether compliance with these essential elements is the only determinative step. The test of agreement for legal purposes is whether the parties have indicated to the outside world, in the form of the objective reasonable bystander, their intention to contract and the terms of such contract. The law is concerned not with the parties' intentions but with their manifested intentions. What was reasonably understood between Mr. Piola and Ms. Petri was that the offer was in writing via the exchange during the internet-based land auction and the acceptance was orally communicated via telephone conversation. 4) The plaintiff was awarded specific performance and damages in the amount of $50,000.  5) The court accepts that the respondent, with his daughter and son-in-law, and his wife, Donna, are equally credible witnesses.  6) The standard deviation between the paragraphs between paragraphs is 1/2 as long as the paragraphs are longer than the paragraph average. 7) The paragraphs that are the basis of the paragraphs in the","[34] The court must determine whether a contract was created between Mr. Petrie and Mr. Ziola respecting the Subject Quarters.

The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced.

e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","The parties married in 1982 and were divorced in 2001. They have two children, aged 23 and 19. The oldest child, who was not a child of the marriage at the time of the application, left the charge of his parents and established an independent household without the consent, agreement, approval or financial support of his siblings. He and his partner took up residence in a downtown Toronto apartment. The issues raised were retroactive review of the base table amount of child support paid by the respondent and the Respondent and their contribution to the section 7 (special expenses) expenses for the children. The respondent argued that although the parties' corollary relief judgment provided for a shared parenting arrangement and equal sharing of all special and extraordinary expenses, the retroactive recalculation should be limited to three years prior to October 9, 2008. HELD: 1)The Court did not have jurisdiction to consider the application of Ms. Niles for retroactive variation of support and a readjustment of the claim for section 7 expenses pertaining to the older child.  2)The court reviewed the law as explained by the Supreme Court of Canada on the issue of retroactive child support and determined that the principles regarding retroactive and blameworthy conduct applied equally to s. expenses. There was no evidence that the respondent had disclosed the claim to the petitioner prior to the date of effective notice. It was clear that the parties had decided that they were independent, financially and otherwise from their parents. 3)The respondent's application to vary was retroactive to July 2004. This is also the year when the petitioner first applied for the award of s.7. The parties agreed that the corollaries of the agreement and the Ontario Court of Appeal had awarded retroactive support of $2,000 to the younger child. 4)The trial judge could not be blind to prevailing social and economic conditions; bachelor's degree no longer assures self-sufficiency. 5)The parties' failure to provide formal notice of the petitioner's claim for a retroactive change in child support should not deprive the petitioner of the right to an award for this type of support. The trial judge must be aware of the respondent's informational advantage to justify his/her deficient child support payments.  6)Judgmentality was not required in this case. The Court held that it was appropriate to apply the Farden Factors to the determination of post-secondary education expenses.","He argued that the court did not have jurisdiction to grant any relief respecting the older child because the older child was not, at the time of the application, a child of the marriage.

As a consequence the recalculation should be three years prior to July 2004 i.e. to 2001. I am satisfied that Mr. Munro did not engage in blameworthy conduct during this period. On the unusual facts of this case I have concluded that communication that represented effective notice in 2004 was voided by the delays of the recipient parent and her failure to prosecute the matter. In my view, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of Mr. Munro, given the passage of several years since effective notice was first received; the significant level of support he was providing; his reasonable belief that he was meeting his obligations; the efforts he made to determine Ms. Niles claim, to respond to it and to settle it.

The respondent applied to vary the date for which retroactive child support should be paid for the younger child, arguing that the court did not have jurisdiction to grant any relief respecting the older child because the older was not, at the time of the application, a child of the marriage. Respondent takes issue with the respondent's claim for retroactive support and s.7 expenses for the parties' older child. The issues raised by the petitioner's application to vary are retroactive review of the base table amount of child support paid by the respondent and the Respondent and the contribution to the section 7 expenses of the children. HELD: 1)The respondent's application was allowed. The court did have jurisdiction on the issue of the first issue; the court's jurisdiction to deal with the claim for retrospective child support and retroactive adjustment to the contribution Mr. Munro must make to the sections of the child support payable in timely manner. 2)The issues raised were whether the court had jurisdiction to make a retroactive order for an adult child, whether the Court should be prevented from enforcing an unfulfilled child support obligation, and 3)whether the trial judge should be limited in his or her discretion to consider blameworthy conduct. The parties' children clearly left the charge of their parents in April 2008. He established an independent household without the consent, agreement, approval or financial support of his parents. He did not seek any of these from his parents when doing so. The proper approach was to consider the alternative issue of recalculation of all child support payments and s7 expenses.  4)The court held that it would be appropriate to apply the Farden Factors to the determination of post-secondary education expenses to be paid by each of the parties.","He argued that the court did not have jurisdiction to grant any relief respecting the older child because the older child was not, at the time of the application, a child of the marriage.

4_2006nssc88.txt,"The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","The parties, who were married in November 1980 and began living separate and apart in August 1993, entered into an oral agreement in which the respondent was to pay $6,000 per month. There was no financial contribution by the mother to the children in the father's care. The father paid by post-dated cheques directly to the mother and the mother destroyed any cheques she received in the previous $2,500 amount; the father took responsibility for $69,500 in matrimonial debt and any other debt in his name. The agreement was recognized by Maintenance Enforcement and the parties' obligations under the Corollary Relief Judgment and refers to s. 17 of the Divorce Act. The mother alleged that she received no money in September and October 2003, when the children left the mother's care and moved with their father to Scotland, to pursue employment and self sufficiency. She claimed that she had no income and that if the father were to receive the garnishee he would have to pay directly to her. She alleged that he owed her $52,000 in spousal and child support for the 2005 and 2006 years. Monthly payments of $1,836 were made to Maintenance Enforcement in the amount of $163.92 and the balance was deducted from the husband's ongoing support payments. The husband continued to pay support as originally ordered. In the absence of any evidence that he was taking in more income as a result of his child support payments than he was retaining himself, the parties came away from this relationship with few, if any, assets and very little by way of retirement plans. One has to consider the excess payments over and above the mandatory support payments; the parties lived together for most of the past 3 years and had four children, aged 11, 13, 14 and 18 years. The history of the children leaving their mother’s care and either moving in with their parents or being supported by their father has been discussed and his financial contribution proven; the husband was paying support directly and the wife was assisting him financially. The wife had no means to pay child support herself and her expenses were borne by the father in the form of rent, utilities and maintenance. She had no savings, pre-separation RRSP's or equity in the home when the parties were divorced and had no equity in it.

The father paid by post-dated cheques directly to the mother and the mother destroyed any cheques she received in the previous $2,500 amount; the father took responsibility for $69,500 in matrimonial debt and any other debt in his name. The agreement was recognized by Maintenance Enforcement and the parties' obligations under the Corollary Relief Judgment and refers to s. 17 of the Divorce Act. The mother alleged that she received no money in September and October 2001, when the children left the mother's care and moved with their father to Scotland, to pursue employment and self sufficiency. She claimed that she had no income and that if the father were to receive the garnishee he would have to pay directly to her. She alleged that he owed her $52,000 in spousal and child support for the 2005 and 2006 years. Monthly payments of $1,836 were made to Maintenance Enforcement in the amount of $163.92 and the balance was deducted from the husband's ongoing support payments. The husband continued to pay support as originally ordered. In the absence of documentation to support the claim, it is impossible to determine the amount owing under the old agreement. The parties entered into the oral agreement with the intention of reducing the monthly support payments from $5,000 to $3,000 and the standard variation clause was contained in the Separation Agreement. The payments were consistent and there was no evidence that the mother was a party to the agreement and any financial contribution was made by the father. The wife was unable to locate any documentation that would have allowed her to locate the actual payments. She had no contact with the husband, who was paying support directly and was assisting the wife by assisting her with the children's education. In January 2006, the husband ceased paying support and Maintenance Enforcement returned the post dated cheques. She asserted that she did not have any difficulty in future to pay the costs of their children's post-secondary education and that the husband was assisting her directly.

The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion.

It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege.

The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant.

The appellant is the former Director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, which encompasses approximately 600 faculty, staff and students and serves approximately 12,000 members of the public each year, as well as functioning as a teaching facility. The hospital is also a public health institution. The plaintiff filed a grievance against the union and its representatives claiming breach of its collective agreement. The grievance alleged systemic harassment, which was not supported by the plaintiff's allegations, but was entirely unsubstantiated and without substance. The union alleged that the plaintiff took an active part in the harassment himself and sought damages for loss of income, loss of pension, and loss of opportunity to obtain an equivalent position in the United States. The respondent commenced an action in defamation against the Union and the Hospital claiming general damages of over $200,000, based upon the conclusions reached by the arbitrators in Torstar Corp. and the Union in suing the union for breach of collective agreement and breach of contract. At issue was whether the arbitration board was the type of 'judicial' institution contemplated by the scope of absolute privilege and whether the publication that took place destroyed any possible claim that the Union might have to absolute privilege. Counsel for the union opposed the application of the defence of qualified privilege in this case, arguing that the court should have considered two factors in assessing whether the publications were protected: 1) that the words in the grievance referenced the Union’s grievance and the Grievance Report; and 2) whether the Union filed a statement of defence which indicated the statements were based on the same grievance and not an attempt to find corroborating witnesses. The parties’ argument that the union published a grievance to try and ensure the plaintiff was able to return to a harassment-free, non-toxic workplace environment but was forced to file this grievance when the plaintiff experienced renewed personal harassment after her return from overseas; and 3) that they published an informational poster that referenced the grievance but did not refer to the grievance itself; the Union did not","Disposition: Appeal allowed Cross-appeal dismissed [1] This appeal concerns the extent to which the principle of qualified privilege applies to defamatory statements made by a union regarding a member of the employer’s management.

The court found that the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements were protected by qualified privilege. The words in question had been posted at the Hospital and on the Union's website. The Union, Mr. Ross and Mr. Nowaselski are the respondents to the appellant's appeal and appellants by way of cross-appeal. The appellant is the former Director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, which encompasses approximately 600 faculty, staff and students and serves approximately 12,000 members of the public each year, as well as functioning as a teaching facility. Dr. Rubin was recruited by the Union and became the Director in 2002. He was then forced to return to his previous position as a full-tenured Professor at the University of Veterinary Medicine. He commenced an action in defamation against the Union, alleging that there was no merit to the defamed statements and that their contents would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person. The trial judge found that these statements were capable of bearing defamedatory meaning notwithstanding the overarching labour relations context and that the words posted on the union's website were more appropriately considered with respect to the defences to the tort of defamation than the defence of absolute privilege.","Disposition: Appeal allowed Cross-appeal dismissed [1] This appeal concerns the extent to which the principle of qualified privilege applies to defamatory statements made by a union regarding a member of the employer’s management. The trial judge held that the principle of qualified privilege protected the union and its representatives when the latter republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. He fixed a provisional award of damages of $25,000 (see: 2010 SKQB 249 (CanLII), [2010] 12 W.W.R. 271). [2] I have concluded that the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements are protected by qualified privilege. I would allow the appeal and fix general damages at $100,000. [48] Based on my review of the authorities, I conclude that the trial judge did not give sufficient effect to: (i) the wording of the defamatory expressions; (ii) the circumstances under which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; (iii) the persons to whom the words were published; and (iv) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to that specific occasion.  In any event, I am satisfied that in the whole of the circumstances, which I have reviewed extensively in connection with the Respondents’ claim for qualified privilege, $25,000 is a wholly erroneous assessment of the damages in this case. [82] Having regard for the same factors that caused me to conclude that $25,000 is a wholly erroneous assessment of general damages, including what was said, how it was published and the effect on Dr. Rubin, I conclude that general damages should be fixed in this case at $100,000. In fixing this amount, I have considered that: (i) the Respondents published the two documents by mailing them and placing them on the website—over the strong objections of the University; (ii) the documents remained on the website some six months after the University demanded that they be removed; (iii) no apology or retraction has ever been made; and (iv) the Union appears to have had no conception of the harm caused to Dr. Rubin. [85] Having regard for all of the above facts and factors, I have concluded that an award of $100,000 provides sufficient compensation and appropriately balances the positions of the parties. That does not mean that a trial judge in such circumstances could not decline to order costs to a successful defendant, but it is not appropriate to decline to do so on the basis of “mixed results.” [93] The appeal is allowed with costs to Dr. Rubin in this Court and in the Court of Queen’s Bench. Dr. Rubin shall have general damages against the Respondents in the amount of $100,000. Since I have allowed the appeal, the cross-appeal is dismissed, but given that the Respondents are clearly correct


with respect to the issue raised in the cross-appeal, it is appropriate in the circumstances of this case to dismiss it without costs.",0.379542395693136,0.37234042553191493,"HELD: The court allowed the appeal and fixed general damages at $100,000. The court found that the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements were protected by qualified privilege. The words expressed by the Union were defamed by the publication of the grievance. The trial judge correctly referred to the labour relations context and the purposes for which the communications were posted are more appropriately considered. The Union, Mr. Ross and Mr. Nowaselski are the respondents to the appellant's appeal and appellants by way of cross-appeal. The appellant is the former Director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, which encompasses approximately 600 faculty, staff and students and serves approximately 12,000 members of the public each year, as well as functioning as a teaching facility. The hospital is also a public health institution. The plaintiff filed a grievance against the union and its representatives claiming breach of its collective agreement. The grievance alleged systemic harassment, which was not supported by the plaintiff's allegations, but was entirely unsubstantiated and without substance. The union alleged that the plaintiff took an active part in the harassment himself and sought damages for loss of income, loss of pension, and loss of opportunity to obtain an equivalent position in the United States. The respondent commenced an action in defamation against the Union and the Hospital claiming general damages of over $200,000, based upon the conclusions reached by the arbitrators in Torstar Corp. and the Union in suing the union for breach of collective agreement and breach of contract. At issue was whether the arbitration board was the type of 'judicial' institution contemplated by the scope of absolute privilege and whether the publication that took place destroyed any possible claim that the Union might have to absolute privilege. Counsel for the union opposed the application of the defence of qualified privilege in this case, arguing that the court should have considered two factors in assessing whether the publications were protected: 1) that the words in the grievance referenced the Union’s grievance and the Grievance Report; and 2) whether the Union filed a statement of defence which indicated the statements were based on the same grievance and not an attempt to find corroborating witnesses. The parties’ argument that the union published a grievance to try and ensure the plaintiff was able to return to a harassment-free, non-toxic workplace environment but was forced to file this grievance when the plaintiff experienced renewed personal harassment after her return from overseas; and 3) that they published an informational poster that referenced the grievance but did not refer to the grievance itself; the Union did not",0.5087900723888314

The executrix applied to have the gift of the deceased's estate bequeathed to the appellant. The appellant appealed the order. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasoning was flawed. He relied on Billing, supra and Eccleston, supra; he failed to give any meaning to the express words used by the jurists in the decision. He failed to consider whether the former spouse had expressly renounced any right to share in the estate of her brother; whether the appellant had immediately renounced her right to have any inheritance in the Will by signing the Separation Agreement or whether she had contractually bound herself to renouncing any inheritance after the death of her husband.

The common law requires that a disclaimer in order to be effective be made after a death of a legator, that is to say when the legatee is entitled to inherit the estate as they saw fit. However, the nature of a disclaimer at common law and its retroactive effect to the date of a former spouse lead to the same result.

e_2009skca138.txt,"This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties.

The Committee did not find any material error on the part of the Committee as it did not rely upon the sale verification information. The issue was whether the Committee erred in law in upholding the decision to include the sale of the mall in its determination of an appropriate MAF. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The assessment of the shopping mall came to rest on the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. 2) The Committee found nothing requiring them to either exclude the sale from consideration in calculating the MAF or to adjust the sale price beyond the adjustments he had already made. 3) While the Committee relied upon the sales of each of the malls in calculating their fair value, it could not reach the conclusion on the basis of the sale verifying information to the exclusion of other relevant information open to consideration. 4) The company did not misapprehend the importance, generally, of a sale verification process and the information it yields. The importance lies in the fact municipal assessors are highly dependent on information at his command, including information supplied to him by the parties to the transaction. One of the reasons the Committee chose not to appeal was because the Committee was not convinced that it had erred. 5) On the issue of the amount paid pursuant to Document 1.1.6, the Court was not persuaded that it was an error of law.","Disposition: Appeal Dismissed

It alleged that the Committee erred in law in failing to find that the sales of the three shopping malls in the analysis did not constitute a 'fair value' as determined by the City, as they were all sold at a rate close to market value and did not include any non-realty items. The company applied for leave to appeal under section 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act alleging an error of law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The Committee did not misapprehend the importance, generally, of the sale verification process and the information it yielded. The importance lies in the fact municipal assessors are highly dependent on the information at his command, including the information supplied to him by the parties to the transaction. Accordingly, the Committee concluded that the sale qualified for inclusion in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived or, alternatively, it claimed that it was a 'willing, unrestricted, unrelated and knowledgeable' buyer within the meaning of the definition of 'arm's length sale' (i.e. a 'diminished' buyer) and were required to take the mall as part of the package and retain the services of the former owner as managers. 2)It was in reliance on the provisions of s. 171 and s. 172 of The Cities Act that the assessor requested the completion of the Sale Verification Form. He did so in reliance upon the three-fold purpose of putting him in position to determine the fair value of the property. He then to calculate and apply a market adjustment factor (MAAF) of 1.31. 3)The reduction in the price had significant impact on the assessments but the company remained dissatisfied and appealed to the Court of Appeal which dismissed the appeal and upheld the Committee's decision to include the sale in the determination of an appropriate MAF (maintaining a fair value for the property). The Court found that both the assessment and the Committee failed to observe the need for an adjustment pursuant to Document 1.1.6 of the Assessment Manual. The","Disposition: Appeal Dismissed

The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case.

5_2016skqb384.txt,"Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, of driving with a blood alcohol content of over.08 on the following grounds: The trial judge erred in law in finding there was no breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights; the trial judge failed to consider the factors articulated by the officer as forming the factual basis for making the breath demand were reliable and capable of supporting the officer's belief that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) There was sufficient evidence, when viewed objectively, to support the officer’s contention that the appellant was impaired by alcohol. The standard of review is correctness and the standard required for an effective waiver of counsel is very high. 2) On the factual and legal grounds, the appeal court may assess the evidence, which is measured on appeal against the yardstick of correctness (see R. v. Shepherd). The appeal court must not substitute its own view of the evidence for that of a trial judge, especially in matters involving findings of fact that were unsupported by the evidence. 3) The officer had four and one-half years’ experience at the time of the offence. He was not required to have overwhelming evidence of impairment. 4) The appellant challenged the objective basis for that belief, namely that there was not sufficient evidence for the officer to believe that she was impaired or that her behaviour was out of the ordinary. 5) The standard for assessing credibility can only be assessed with great deference and, absent palpable and overriding error, the facts as found by the court should not be disturbed.","[1] Chantelle Drake [Ms. Drake] appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, of driving with a blood alcohol content of over .08, on the following grounds:
a) The learned trial judge erred in law in finding that there was no s. 8 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms [Charter], breach to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure;
b) The learned trial judge erred in law in finding that there was no breach of the s. 10(b) Charter giving everyone the right on arrest or detention the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. The alleged errors of fact are listed as follows:
a) The trial judge failed to consider that other cars had previously made a tight turn as evidenced by other tire tracks in the soft snow; [31] The trial judge, in attributing four and half years’ experience to the officer when in fact the officer had only three years’ experience at the time of the offence, did not commit material error. [34] The trial judge did not make any findings of fact that were unsupported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he held that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported the officer’s belief that the appellant’s ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired. I dismiss ground one of the appeal. [35] The appellant contends that the failure of Cst. Schmidt to provide the appellant with the Prosper warning resulted in a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. Counsel for the appellant contends that failure to advise Ms. Drake of the availability of duty counsel and failure to provide a Prosper warning constituted breach of his client’s s. 10(b) Charter rights. She declined and said she was happy just leaving a message. [61] Even if I am mistaken in that regard, I am satisfied that Ms. Drake provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her s. 10(b) Charter right to contact legal counsel.

The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code for driving with a blood alcohol content of over.08. The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in law in finding there was no breach of s. 8 Canadian Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge properly found that there was sufficient evidence, when viewed objectively, to support the officer's contention that the appellant was impaired. The standard of review on a summary conviction appeals is based on an error of law, failure to consider all relevant evidence in making a determination that there is sufficient objective evidence for the officer to make a breath demand. 2) The appellant challenges the objective basis for that belief, namely that there wasn't sufficient evidence that the accused has, within the preceding three hours, driven while impaired or while over the proscribed limit. 3) On the whole of the evidence, am satisfied that the court properly found there was a sufficient evidence of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. When making a demand for a breath sample, an officer is only required to believe that the suspect has committed an offence and the police have an obligation to refrain from eliciting any incriminating evidence until the detainee has been given the opportunity to consult with legal counsel. 4) The standard for assessing credibility can only be set out by an appeal court with great deference and, absent palpable and overriding error, the facts as found by the judge should not be disturbed.","[1] Chantelle Drake [Ms. Drake] appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, of driving with a blood alcohol content of over .08, on the following grounds:
a) The learned trial judge erred in law in finding that there was no s. 8 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms [Charter], breach to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure;
b) The learned trial judge erred in law in finding that there was no breach of the s. 10(b) Charter giving everyone the right on arrest or detention the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. The alleged errors of fact are listed as follows:
a) The trial judge failed to consider that other cars had previously made a tight turn as evidenced by other tire tracks in the soft snow; [31] The trial judge, in attributing four and half years’ experience to the officer when in fact the officer had only three years’ experience at the time of the offence, did not commit material error.

An order was never issued and therefore, no judgment was taken out. The applicant now applied to have a formal judgment issued, and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report. The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time. The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour. The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure. She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy. HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report. It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report. There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time. The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old. He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court. The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program. The parties were prohibited from discussing the report process with the child and they were ordered not to influence, coach, sway, or prompt the child towards particular views or statements for the purposes of the report.

The child was apprehended at birth and is currently the subject of a child protection hearing. The applicant takes the position that it is not the appropriate party to act as a litigation guardian on behalf of H.B. However that does not fully determine the issue. Pursuant to its statutory authority and to its inherent parens patriae jurisdiction, the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of the child; she requires independent representation to ensure that her rights are protected. HELD: An order was issued pursuant to s. 32 of The Child and Family Services Act and an order was ordered to issue accordingly unless the public trustee, within 10 days from the date of this order, showed cause as to why it was not the proper party to so act. There was no order as to costs.  1)The Minister was right in asserting that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under mentaldisability in cases other than where a property interest is involved. 2)S. 32 is considered in the context of the entire Act. It is intended to authorize the public trustee to protect and administer the property of infants and dependant adults. Nowhere does the Act authorize the PTA toact as a personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. 3)The Public Trustees best fits the criteria enunciated by Wright J. in Szwydky v.

c_2012skqb372.txt,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications.

The context in which the delay occurred is that of a one-year period of time. 3) While one year is an excessive period, it does not lead me to the position that this claim should be struck on that basis. The delay is neither inordinate nor inexcusable. The time between service of the statement of claim and the application to compel the plaintiff to disclose settlement amounts is entirely attributable to the defendant. The defendant has made its case and ordered the specific amounts for each structure for which the plaintiff settled its claim to be disclosed.  4) The Court of Appeal has set out the principles for determining whether or not a claim for wantof prosecution in International Capital Corp. v. Robinson Twigg & Ketilson, 2010 SKCA 48. The test for discharging the burden to establish an exception should not be set too low. The Court found that for the initial period of May 2006 to May 2010 the delay was inordinate but excusable.

However, in order to allow rescission, would have to determine that he has, firstly, present inability to pay the arroars and, secondly, that he will not in the future be able to pay them. 3) In the circumstances, the respondent is entitled to pay as little as $425 per month as child support, commencing in November 2006 and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter.",0.5348837209302325

c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent.

The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent.

It is preventative rather than punitive. 12) The burden of proof is on the Crown and requires proof on a balance of probabilities. The test is both subjective and objective.

He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence.

Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, the Court declared him a dangerous offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. The defendant appealed. He argued that during the dangerous offender hearing the judge failed to give adequate consideration to the experts' assessment of the two expert witnesses who both recommended that he be declared a long-term offender instead of an dangerous offender. He also conceded that the trial judge's view that the defendant was not willing to take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for the sexual assaults was prophetic. He followed this up with a letter to the court stating that he was doing a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit.

It was clear that he had not rehabilitated as a result of the assaults and that his rehabilitation efforts had not met the onus on him to do so. 2) The defendant was found to be in good health and appeared to be doing well in the early stages of his rehabilitation. His rehabilitation efforts were focused on reducing his risk of re-occurring sexual offences and he was found not to have a substantial risk of repeat sexual assaults. The court was satisfied that his rehabilitative efforts were meted out to him over the course of five years. His sentence was determined to be indefinite. The predicate offences that led to his being classified as being sexual assaults were met with an indefinite sentence.

His rehabilitation efforts were focused on reducing his risk of re-occurrence of sexual offences. The fact that he had not committed any of the offences and was willing to cooperate with the assessment was a sufficient reason to impose an indefinite sentence of indefinite imprisonment. 3) There are countless other examples of defendant's disruptive and violent behaviour while incarcerated that would deter others from participating in sexual offender rehabilitation programs.

As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900. He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears. The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.","The petitioner seeks an interim order setting his ongoing child support obligation as well as addressing the arrears. The parties subsequently entered into an agreement whereby the parties agreed the $300 per month would be greater than their legal obligation. Arrears have accumulated and the petitioner seeks to expunge them. The petitioner is part of a family farm operation. He supplements his farm income with working for part of the season at a local sporting store. This generates some rental income. The respondent takes the position the petitioner's line 150 income does not reflect his ability to pay. HELD: 1) The child support order of December 11, 1991 was registered in this Court January 27, 1992 pursuant to s. of The Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, 1983.

8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. HELD: 1) Does this Court have jurisdiction to set aside the director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen’s Bench? 2) If so, what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the certificate? 3) In the case of adjudicator appeals, the applicant has not satisfactorily explained why it was that he did not file the appeal within 21 days after receiving formal notice. There is no dispute as to whether the applicant was served with the documentation by registered mail. 4) The applicant either declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language on the document. This, at the very least, amounts to wilful blindness. The consequences for inaction parallel those of defendant who is noted for default as a result of his failure to file a statement of defence within the prescribed time frame. 5) There are two bases upon which it can be found that the Court is clothed with jurisdiction and provide remedy in appropriate circumstances. The first is that where a judgment is filed in this Court that it is not a true appeal that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. The second is that appeals are statutorily based and if there is no foundation in statute, there is a need to exercise discretion to grant an extension. The principles and considerations that apply to 'adjudicator appeals' are much different. There has been no independent evidentiary based finding that would suggest or from which it could be reasonably inferred that the applicant cannot read or has any limitations that might effect his ability to understand the documentation served upon him. The Court has jurisdiction to open up the certificate and to grant equitable relief to the applicant. 6) The Court is not without jurisdiction in the areas of extension of time to serve statutory appeals. Time limits must be strictly enforced. There was no firm date set and the discussion occurred as stated in the affidavits of the labour standards officers. 7) The application is to be made as soon as possible after the judgment sought to be set aside comes to the attention of the applicant in the event of any delay. It would be unfair to hold a party to an arbitrary deadline and to deny them the right to proceed to adjudication.","[1] The applicant, Barry Strange, operating under the trade name of Middle Lake Hotel 2002 (“the applicant”), brings an application seeking an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (“the Director”) and filed with this Court.

The Director takes the position that the applicant has not met the criteria necessary to trigger the exercise of the Court's discretion.

The principles and the rules that flow from them and which have developed in relation to the opening up of noting for a default and in setting aside default judgments ought not to be set aside. However, virtually any judgment is set aside with merely a bald assertion by an applicant that he did not appreciate the seriousness or impact of the documentation served upon him. Simply stating that, 'I thought my letter of April 21, 2008 would be sufficient...' and 'I did not realize that had to take further action' is not sufficient explanation for his failure to meet the criteria. The fact that the document appeared to be formal in nature and upon receipt the applicant most certainly ought to have taken measures to determine what it was that he needed do as result of being served with that document.

HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch and filed with the Court of Queen's Bench. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. HELD: 1) The Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a true appeal that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. 2) There is no dispute as to whether the applicant was served with the documentation by registered mail. The registered letter clearly stipulates that should the applicant wish to appeal he must take certain steps within 21 days. 3) The applicant either declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language on the document. This, at the very least, amounts to wilful blindness. 4) The application is to be made as soon as possible after the judgment sought to be set aside comes to the attention of the applicant in the event of any delay. An adjudicator appeal is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. 5) There are at least two bases upon which it can be found that the Court is clothed with jurisdiction to exercise its discretion and provide remedy in appropriate circumstances. The first is that the principles and the rules that flow from them and which have developed in relation to the opening up of noting for default and in setting aside default judgments ought not be limited to situations where judgment of this Court was obtained as a result of the failure of an employer who has missed the 21 day limitation for the recovery of debt. The second is that there is no provision in the Act allowing for an extension of time in which to bring an appeal outside of the mandatory time limitation for that time. In such circumstances, the Court has jurisdiction to set aside the certificate. Time limits must be strictly enforced. Time is not given to applications that ask for a hearing or to requests that are set aside before a hearing can proceed to adjudication. The Court is not obliged to open up a judgment on the basis of that failure.","[1] The applicant, Barry Strange, operating under the trade name of Middle Lake Hotel 2002 (“the applicant”), brings an application seeking an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (“the Director”) and filed with this Court. ISSUES [2] The issues raised in this application are:

(1) Does this Court have jurisdiction to set aside the Director’s certificate filed with the Court of Queen’s Bench?

(2) If so, what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the wage assessment certificate?

(3) Has the applicant satisfied the criteria? [34] Accordingly, even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen’s Bench both require “appeals” within “21 days” an appeal to the Court of Queen’s Bench is a true appeal while an “appeal” to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, I conclude that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. [37] I conclude that this Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant’s request, on a director appeal, because it is not a “true appeal” that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. If the employee had sued the employer for the wages, which it would be her right to do, and if a statement of claim had been served, but not defended, and the matter was noted for default, this Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the defendant/employer’s application to open up of a noting for default should be granted. The Queen’s Bench Rules provide for the opening up of a noting for default. It logically follows, therefore, that where a judgment is filed in this Court that this Court would be able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. [44] Accordingly, I find that it is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant’s request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals. [53] The applicant has failed to satisfy me that the third prong of the four-pronged test has been met and, accordingly, I am not prepared to exercise my discretion in favour of setting aside the Director’s certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.",0.6338672768878718,0.6437941473259333,"FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch and filed with the Court of Queen's Bench.

9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","Dr. Huerto commenced an action against the Government in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of his patients. He appealed from the Queen’s Bench ruling in favour of the use of the AU code. Appeal dismissed; cross-appeal dismissed. In order to properly assess its merit, it was necessary to look more deeply at the Payment Schedule. It contemplates that the Government has some authority to look behind the face of the accounts presented for payment. The aspects of the Protocol impugned by the physician characterizes it as an individualized administrative process. However, the Protocol is not an attempt to regulate his pattern of practice by or through the Protocol. Rather, it allows the Government to request more information about the services underpinning the accounts and, in appropriate situations, to deny payment. Such matters, according to the physician, can only be addressed through a JMPRC established pursuant to s. 49.2 of the MCIA. HELD: Both the appeal and the cross- appeal must be dismissed. 1) The Protocol is obviously an individualization administrative process and the principles set out in the Protocol are not inconsistent with s. 17(1)(c). 2) It is possible to raise an argument that refusal to pay accounts, or certain kinds of accounts, is inconsistent with sec. 18(2) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act (the MCIA). However, it is necessary to understand the broad outline of the scheme which governs payment for physician services in Saskatchewan. 3) In this case, however, the physician chose not to respond to the requests for further information, or to make any reasonable effort to do so. As a practical consequence of that decision, he received no payment for the services in issue.  4) Out of province beneficiary histories are to be assessed against the excel histories contained on the file. The Protocol ties directly into the 'Assessment Rules' portion of the Schedule. In particular, it ties into the aspect of those Rules which states that accounts may be adjusted with reference to the relationship between the service being billed and prior or subsequent services and in addition, may be adjust with reference thereto to the submission of claims for related services. 5) The standard deviation of errors in the calculation of error is 0.04. 6) The payment schedule is best characterized as an 'individual feature of the payment regime'.","Disposition: Appeal dismissed/Cross-appeal dismissed [1] This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Carlos Huerto and the respondent, Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients.

The Government cross-appealed, arguing both the Protocol and the MCIA code are invalid because they amount to an attempt to regulate his pattern of practice. The Protocol is not inconsistent with s. 17(1)(c). However, the reality is that most physicians have the option of either working wholly outside the publicly funded health care plan, billing patients directly or having the patients seek reimbursement from the Government or submitting accounts directly to the Government for payment. Most physicians opt for the third approach. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the cross appeal dismissed.

The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.","This was an application for an order for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13 and an interim payment under Rule 31.01.

Defence argued there was no 'air of reality' to the plaintiff's argument. Application allowed; summary judgment entered against the defendant with damages to be assessed; costs in the cause of the action to be set aside. Although there was some evidence to support the defendant's argument, there was not an air of reality to it. Furthermore, the plaintiff was relying on credibility and the medical evidence at trial.

They separated in October 2004 after the petitioner (who was working part-time and lived with her mother when she was not attending university) filed a counter-petition for divorce. The parties have four children from their first marriage. The petitioner is the primary parent and the primary caregiver to the children. The respondent is 65 years old and retired. He lives in a three bedroom apartment in Lower Sackville approximately 10 minutes walk from the children's school. The two older children stay with their mother when they are away from their school, and the parties' two younger children move in with her each week.

The court will retain jurisdiction to make final disposition regarding all corollary issues and with respect to child support and costs. 1) The respondent's evidence all too frequently gravitated to what he considered to be his wife's transgressions and issues relating to money. The Court accepted his evidence that he did not help with the care of the children particularly during the marriage when they were attending university. 2) There was considerable disagreement between the parents regarding the custody arrangements. It would be in the best interests of the child to remain in the custody of their mother and to have custody arrangements in place knowing that it was only an Interim Order.  3) The court was asked to determine the views of the parties regarding their living arrangements and to take into account the willingness of the petitioner to facilitate such contact. The judge generally provides the Court with recommendation based on her interviews. The evidence is just one of many factors that the Court takes into account when determining what is in the children’s best interests. 4) The parties were awarded joint custody of the four children under the terms of the Divorce Act and the 'best interests' test in that it is an objective test, albeit one which is to be applied according to the evidence in the case.","[44] After having considered section 16 of the Divorce Act and all of the evidence I have come to the conclusion that it would be in the best interests of the children to be in the custody and primary care of their mother. 2.

HELD: 1) The applicant was prohibited by the terms of the TLC from marketing any product that was not Potash Potash. 2) The defendant was found liable pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule No. 387(a) for failing to obtain sufficient assurances that the defendant's system was efficient enough for its needs. The Court was also required to deduct costs from the application.  3) In addition to the defendant having obtained the exclusive license from the plaintiff and the exclusive marketing agreement from the defendant, the defendant has also obtained a declaration by the plaintiff that it is not the only source for proprietary information obtained by it in the course of its business. The Confidentiality Agreement between the defendant and the plaintiff was not a patented process. While the defendant had a system of machines and equipment that were configured in a certain way so as to utilize an ion exchange and crystallization process, such was not only one that could be used to produce potassium sulphite. 4) The plaintiff was found to have a contractual and other relationship with the defendant based upon the fact that it had already established its own system from scratch with the assistance of third parties and did not seek to sell or use that technology. The court was unable to determine that either of the parties had a contractual or other relationship. 5) The court ordered further and other ancillary relief ordered by way of injunction or otherwise as counsel may advise and the court may allow.",0.3822393822393823

The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached. In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary. 1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another. Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles. The R. v. Emke decision is outdated. 3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty. There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code, and driving while over the legal border in violation of s. 27(5) of that Act. The police officer was on duty in uniform and driving a marked police vehicle when he observed the accused and passenger, both in the front seat and in the mid rear, proceeding west on 28th Street. The vehicle signaled right and the officer observed an out of date sticker on it's license plate. The officer engaged the police lights and observed the vehicle hit the curb, bounced off the curb and then proceeded to stop within 30 feet of the vehicle.

The Crown need not establish the existence of the matters set out in s. 227.1(2). The evidence and submissions did not reveal whether the accountant or investor were officers, directors or shareholders in HMPS. It was concluded that the accountant and the investor were relying upon an investor of H.R.P.S. and/or the accountant of that company to make the deductions and necessary remittances and that suggests either of these individuals were at least equally, if not more, responsible for these offences.",0.4700460829493088

ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA). The order prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares of Alliance Green Traders pending a final decision on the merits of the plaintiff's claims against the defendant in Turkey, and the conclusion of this action.

For the reasons that follow, that application is denied. The application to add ABank as a plaintiff, and to amend the draft Amended Statement of Claim which has been filed, is granted. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant Hüseyin Arslan has defaulted on his obligation to pay the plaintiff $13,813,544.88 pursuant to certain guarantees. The addition of ABank as a plaintiff, and amending the Statement of Claim in the manner proposed, would not create a wholly new proceeding.

Claypool, 2003 SKPC 116 (CanLII), all of which restated the principle of honest belief based on reasonable grounds about whether short delay is necessary to obtain reliable reading. 2) The court erred in determining that in all of the relevant circumstances it wasn't objectively possible for the police to have used the accurate test. 3) There was no pass off between the officer and the officer that the evidence was there for both of them in that the officer either did not get or did not rely upon the accurate information, such as the fact that the driver was observed leaving the bar. In such circumstances, the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied upon the results of the test in any event. 4) The mere possibility that driver has consumed alcohol within 15 minutes before taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation. Likewise, whether the wet ground near the driver's side of the vehicle was just urine is also speculation.","[1] On August 9, 2006 Mr. Lundrigan was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08.

The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue.

The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with.

Clarke should not be required to answer questions which are not answered in the course of their investigation. 3) While there may be many situations where it is entirely appropriate and an efficient approach to ask a defendant whether they accept certain costs or expenses incurred as a result of the action or to provide answers which they say relate and do not relate to the derailment, it is ultimately a plaintiff's burden to prove its damages and a defendant is not required to assist plaintiffs to do so.  4) There is nothing in Clarke's response to the undertakings that would be inappropriate in any event of the cause. It is entirely up to the court to decide whether to accommodate the defendant. CN's application to tender the sketch as evidence at trial was premature and unnecessary. 5) The approach taken here of presenting several hundred pages of invoices and other documents and asking the defendant to advise which words say relate to what they say in the plaintiff's file is of such nature and scale that it is not appropriate.

The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success.","The plaintiff, an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Saskatoon Civic Employees' Union, commenced this action under the simplified procedure of Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules seeking judgment for $50,000.

Pulley. 2) The Union submits that there are two key reasons why the plaintiff is not entitled to be indemnified: the indemnity clause was not intended to be used to initiate actions but rather to defend actions or proceedings; and 3) the plaintiff was not an executive officer at the relevant time or was not acting in his/her duties as an Executive Officer when he made the comments and published the material for which he is being sued. The argument between the plaintiff and the union is even further removed from those which the Labour Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction.

6_2011nssc48.txt,"The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building. The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions.

The building was essentially a wooden structure with vinyl siding on exterior walls and asphalt roof shingles. The ceiling was completely black with smoke and flames. The plaintiff suffered serious injuries from the fall. The fire alarm system in the building was not working at the time of the fire. The smoke detector in the plaintiff's apartment was not functioning properly. There were problems with the fire alarm systems not functioning prior to the fire which was known to the defendant's supervisor; the defendant did not maintain, test, inspect or inspect its fire engine system that was in excess of 25 years old; there were no beeping noises coming from the smoke alarm system. Although there was no evidence the defendant was responsible for the fire, the defendant breached the standard of care owed to the plaintiffs by failing to ensure they were reasonably safe from injury while residing in the premises. Liability and damages were at issue in this case. The common law duty of care arises from the proximity of the relationship between a landlord and the tenants of its multi-unit residential building. In this case, the defendants owed a duty of caring to the plaintiff to ensure their were reasonably secure from injury by residing in their premises. This would include the installation and maintenance of an operational fire system. The defendant was also subject to statutory obligations. The residential Tenancies Act sets out statutory conditions that apply to all residential leases including the requirement to keep the premises in good state of repair and to comply with any statutes regarding safety. The National Fire Code required the installation of an 'operating fire alarm' system which must be tested yearly. Also, yearly testing of the smoke alarms was required. In the circumstances the plaintiff was injured, the damages would have been incurred on a balance of probabilities.","[37] Although there is no evidence the defendant was responsible for the fire, I find the defendant’s conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire.

HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving.

The evidence did not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the accused was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of s. 8 and 9 of the Charter of Rights, it should be excluded under Section 24(2). Its admission would render the trial process unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1) The accused's own testimony that she would have been more impaired later at the detachment or at the 711, after drinking three or four beer within the preceding hour, was not enough to prove impaired ability to operate a motor vehicle.

Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith.

The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand.

She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving.

The accused also entered into plea agreements with the co-accused and the defence. The sentencing judge found that the accused had a less than perfect upbringing as a child and had a fair amount of instability in his years of life. The pre-sentence report prepared by the Crown recommended a sentence of four years to a maximum of five years, as well as a 10 year prohibition from the possession of weapons. The Crown sought a period of six years incarceration, as opposed to the 10 years already imposed for breaking and entering. The defence sought to rationalize the range of sentences imposed for home invasions, arguing that the sentencing judge failed to take into account the aggravating circumstances of the accused's previous offences, particularly his failure to alert the appropriate parties to obtain assistance for the victim. HELD: The appropriate sentence was for the home invasion, having regard to all of the factors that go into the calculation of the sentence: four years for the offence of break and enter under s. 348.1(b) of the Code, a life imprisonment sentence for common assault, a two-year prohibition from possessing a weapon for the same purpose, and 10 years for common break and enters. The sentences imposed were based on the factors set out in the Code that the Crown had reviewed prior to making the determinations in the case of this case.

He cooperated with the police and provided evidence against his co-accused. He had a previous criminal record, which included convictions for mischief, theft, break and enter, breach of an undertaking and possession of stolen goods. Defendant sentenced to four years imprisonment; in assessing the appropriate sentence, the court allowed a credit for time already served (which was served virtually throughout in protective custody), a credit of 25% for the fact that the defendant had pled guilty and a further reduction of one and a half years for the defendant's assistance in pursuing the successful prosecution of his co-accused.","The accused, who had previously entered guilty pleas to eight counts contained in an indictment, was charged with breaking and entering and theft. The charge was originally a charge of aggravated assault but the accused plead guilty to breaking and enters and stole property. The accused was convicted of being a party to the unlawful causing of bodily harm. The evidence in the case was that the accused had a Grade X education and that he had sporadic employment over his adult years. HELD: The appropriate sentence is a term of four years and six months in a federal institution, with a period of six years incarceration.

The accused also entered into plea agreements with the co-accused and the defence. The sentencing judge found that the accused had a less than perfect upbringing as a child and had a fair amount of instability in his years of life. The pre-sentence report prepared by the Crown recommended a sentence of four years to a maximum of five years, as well as a 10 year prohibition from the possession of weapons. The Crown sought a period of six years incarceration, as opposed to the 10 years already imposed for breaking and entering. The defence sought to rationalize the range of sentences imposed for home invasions, arguing that the sentencing judge failed to take into account the aggravating circumstances of the accused's previous offences, particularly his failure to alert the appropriate parties to obtain assistance for the victim. HELD: The appropriate sentence was for the home invasion, having regard to all of the factors that go into the calculation of the sentence: four years for the offence of break and enter under s. 348.1(b) of the Code, a life imprisonment sentence for common assault, a two-year prohibition from possessing a weapon for the same purpose, and 10 years for common break and enters. The sentences imposed were based on the factors set out in the Code that the Crown had reviewed prior to making the determinations in the case of this case. The evidence was extensive, the accused readily admitted his culpability and co-operated fully with the police, including testifying at the trial of the other accused and the defendant was found guilty of a similar count in relation to similar offences committed in the same area.

This was a minor problem and the sellers did not omit that the place had flooded on at least one occasion. The Claimant alleged the Defendants burned out his shop vac cleaning up water in the basement and asked to borrow the neighbours' shop vac. The shop vac was found on two different walls neither of which was the complainant's. There were watermarks coming down the cement wall behind the windows and on the floor in the recreation room. The claimants claim they suffered any damage due to any non-disclosure, misinformation or misrepresentation, nor is any damage casually connected to any act or omission of the Defendants. HELD: The claim was dismissed. The court held that it was necessary to allow the parties to present all the facts that can be proven in a court of law, which is part of the make up that is imposed upon the litigants and those that hear the case. 1)The court reviewed the law on a motion for non-suit and found that the principles of merger and reasonableness in the application of the test in Pino v. Clahane were not lost on the court. 2)There was a fine balance between an adversarial process and an inquisitional process that raises itself often in Small Claims Court proceedings. 3)The doctrine of merger had been softened considerably in the sale of goods due to legislative intrusion but it has yet to take place with the real property. The common person is not operating on a level playing field when facing an opposing counsel with vast experience and law degree. 4)The claim for damages was dismissed because of insufficient evidence. It was not necessary to consider the sufficiency of evidence without weighing the evidence or evaluating its believability to see if the Court had a case which was recognized by the law.",0.484181568088033
e_1999canlii6888.txt,"The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales.

The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by the defendant. The defendants had each formed a new company under the company name of A.A. Putnam Sons Limited. The operation consisted of a dairy farm with about 250 milking cows, a beef operation, a trailer park and a gravel pit operation. The defendant sold the operation to three brothers. The three brothers each formed new company at that time with Gene owning the dairy farm and Lorne owning the trucking company. Gene became manager of the dairy operation in 1989 and was able to testify based on his knowledge of the relevant quota schemes and his experience as a result of the operation. He was also a lawyer. He drafted security documents for the defendant which showed the effective date of the new quota scheme. Gene testified that he was the drafter of the two documents and he drafted the agreements.

The three brothers each formed a new company at that time with Gene owning the dairy farm and Merle owning the trailer park and gravel pit operation. The plan was to incorporate new company called 'Geneco.' Gene Putnam died in 1982 and after his death his company changed over to a single quota system known as Total Production Quota (TPQ). Therefore any sales after that date were under the new quota scheme. The plaintiff argued that the agreement only refers to the Fluid Milk Quota and therefore it was obligated to only share proceeds from the sale of the sold version of the quota and not all quota sold. The defendant agreed to split the proceeds three ways. First, it was agreed that all three brothers would get a share of the sale proceeds. The second, the agreement was not binding on any of the plaintiffs. The third, and the most important issue was the sharing of proceeds from a sale of only one quota. The plaintiffs sought to have the agreement interpreted as meaning that the three brothers and their company were obligated to share proceeds only from sales of only the one quota sold and that all other quota sold should be retained by the actual milk producer. The parties agreed that the quota would be transferred to the new company and that if the quota was disposed of prior to 2003 it would be shared equally among the brothers. The agreement was based on the terms of the previous agreement which clearly indicated that they and their father had agreed that they would have joint ownership of all the milk quota owned by the company and the Market Share Quota. The fourth, and perhaps the most significant issue, was the possibility of a tax consequences resulting from the reorganization of the parent company.

The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","The Crown sought to admit the two previous incidents of choking as similar fact evidence to prove issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm, sexual assault and threatening to kill after she confronted her husband with whom she had previously been. She was found murdered in her residence with the light outs and his car hidden from her view. The Crown tendered several statements that were made by the deceased to several Crown witnesses concerning two previous occasions. At the stage of the hearsay admissibility the trial judge must determine the procedure, whether by voir dire or otherwise, for the determination of admissiblilty. Hearsay evidence is presumptively inadmissible. It could be used to show hostile behaviour by the accused that would lead to a motive to kill or to show that the evidence of similar facts is not tainted with collusion. However, the evidence may also be used as evidence to show a specific hostility and intention to harm the victim, which could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is a serious potential for moral prejudice based on the existence of evidence such as the resemblance to the victim's previous injuries and the fact that she had choked her husband. HELD: The evidence is admissible on a principled basis, the governing principles being the reliability of the evidence and its necessity and reliability and it should not be admitted in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial. 1) There must be some evidence capable of reasonably supporting finding that the appellant was implicated in the other similar acts. 2) The existence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the same evidence; and the strength of evidence that the events occurred are all admissible. 3) The Court must not invade the province of a trier of fact and condition a hearsay evidence as it may distract members of the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge.

The paternal grandmother was the subject of protection proceedings brought by the Children's Aid Society in the Family Division. The Family Division placed the child in the permanent care and custody of the Children’s Aid Society of Halifax. The grandmother found out about the order after the fact, and found out that the Society had wrongly shut her out of the process and that the judge in the family division erred in not considering family placement with her before the order was made. The applicant sought to add a party for the purposes of bringing an appeal. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Chambers judge does not have the authority to make the order sought. The authority of the Chambers judge depends on an express or implied grant of power in a rule or enactment and should not be interpreted as conferring jurisdiction. There are a number of issues of fact which the Court would not make an order as, in its opinion, an application to the Family Court for leave to terminate the permanently care order appears likely to be a more appropriate initial way for the applicant to proceed.

The plaintiff commenced a second action in which it claimed the city's negligence had been decided by a combination of the trial judge's and the Court of Appeal's decisions in the first action and the trial of the second action. In this action, the plaintiff requested certain paragraphs of the defendant's defence be struck out pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 14.25 on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. The second application was also dismissed. HELD: The Court granted the application and dismissed the second application. 1)The doctrine of 'issue estoppel' applied to both applications. While it is not technically necessary to decide this matter, the Court could say that it would have no hesitation in deciding the matter itself. 2)On the issue of the 'first action' it is clear that the defendant should have raised the point now asserted in the plaintiff's first action (quantum meruit) based on the non-disclosure of the soil reports. It appears to have been well aware that the factual basis for the present allegation was not litigated in the original fashion. It is common ground that the two site evaluation reports prepared by the defendant were not provided to the plaintiff prior to the bidding, obtaining and entering into into the contract. The City had abandoned the idea of an international caliber soccer field after concluding it could not afford such a field. The increased potential damage pool as a result of the application did not constitute new facts which could not have been discovered with reasonable diligence. 3)Costs of the first and second application were awarded to both parties.","I find that, on the basis of all of the affidavits, the first action as amended from time to time and as adjudicated, the agreed statement of facts and the present pleadings, that the application of CBCL ought to be granted. I find that the present cause of action is the very same one litigated in the first action, simply under a different legal concept. I am satisfied that to allow Granview to now basically relitigate the same action on the same factual basis on a different legal concept which it considered but did not proceed with would be an abuse of process of the court. I therefore grant CBCL\'s application and strike out the statement of claim and dismiss the present action. The application of Granview is therefore dismissed.",0.311787072243346,0.488135593220339,"The plaintiff was subcontracted by the City of Dartmouth to build a sports field. The defendant were the project consultants for the City, and were involved throughout the tendering process and construction. Their report indicated a number of significant potential problems. The plaintiff was not made aware of the report when it bid on the project. The plaintiff subsequently became aware of the problems, which made their work more costly. After completing the work, it commenced a claim for the additional work which had to be performed due to the undisclosed site conditions. The defendants were joined by the City as a third party to that action. The plaintiff was successful at trial, but the decision was overturned on appeal. The plaintiff then commenced the present action directly against the defendant, alleging negligent misrepresentation. The defendant applied to strike the action on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process.

It was clear that the defendant was considering all its legal remedies and avenues for relief for non-closure and it did not intend to proceed with the same action. Many tens of thousands of dollars by the parties, not to mention court time and resources, would have to be expended on relitigation of the same issue.  3)The Court found that the application should have been dismissed because of a fundamental inconsistency in that argument.  4)Costs of the application were awarded to the plaintiff on the first application plus disbursements to be taxed if they cannot be agreed upon.","I find that, on the basis of all of the affidavits, the first action as amended from time to time and as adjudicated, the agreed statement of facts and the present pleadings, that the application of CBCL ought to be granted.

In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products.

The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property. The mother was awarded costs of the application set at $350.","The parties have three children aged four to eight years. The respondent is involved in a litigation against the Government of Canada wherein he seeks damages for abuse he allegedly suffered while attending an Indian residential school. Affidavits indicate that examinations for discovery are complete but the respondent's solicitor handling the claim advises no offer to settle has been received. Since the issuance of the order the respondent has been, for the most part, unemployed by reason of health problems and, as a result, arrears of child support are constantly accruing. HELD: In the event the respondent receives a settlement in his law suit for abuse suffered at the Indian Residential School, the first $50,000, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court so that the parties might speak to the distribution of same. The threshold to be met in such an application is simply that the disposition or wasting of the asset would impair or defeat a claim under the Act. It is not offensive to direct that the defendant's counsel, at the time of such settlement, if there is a settlement, pay monies into Court. Such an order does not impact the rights of the petitioner's counsel but merely imposes a clerical task which is natural incident to the preservation of an asset in debate.","[2] Since the issuance of the order the respondent has been, for the most part, unemployed by reason of health problems and, as a result, arrears of child support are constantly accruing. (b) the Respondent, [M.E.H.], is hereby restrained from disposing of any money that he has received or may receive in relation to the lawsuit without further Order of the Court with the exception of paying any and all legal fees and disbursements plus taxes owing to his solicitors.

The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means.

After Mabel died in 1997, the plaintiff's wife, the mother of the four granddaughters, took the instructions home with her. The instructions were given to her in 1992.

Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account. Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter. The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters. HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had wrongfully, in breach of a trust, retained the sum of $20,000 to which his four daughters were entitled. The plaintiffs four children were born in 1992, Mabel placed $17,500 in a bank account in the name of the plaintiff and added $8,000 in 1995 to the account as joint owner. The plaintiff's wife, the mother of the four granddaughters, testified that she took the instructions home with her after she had read the notes Mabel had given her. The instructions were given to her in 1992. The following Sunday, Pennefather died before Royal Trust Company had completed the instructions by transferring the funds to the credit of the annuity contract of Daisy McIntyre. The deceased had been diagnosed with cancer in late 1997. It was terminal, she was dying on March 24, 1998 at which time the bank account was still in the plaintiff's name. HELD: The written instructions were never provided to the plaintiff. The defendant became the sole trustee for the account for the benefit of the plaintiffs four grandchildren.  1)An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appear that there is an intention to declare a trust and not merely to make a transfer. 2)An individual does not create an equity in the favour of the trustee. If a settlement is intended to take effect by transfer, the court will not hold the intended transfer to operate as a trust of trust, for then every imperfect instrument could be made effectual by being converted into a perfect trust. 3)The written instructions do not contain any words which could possibly be construed a declarationof trust. The trust is not validly created where there is mere intention of creating trust, or voluntary agreement to do so, and the settlor himself contemplates some further act for the purpose of giving it completion.","[1] The plaintiff, as litigation guardian of his four daughters, has alleged that the defendant has wrongfully, in breach of a trust, retained the sum of $20,000.00 to which his daughters are entitled.

She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L.

It is clear on the evidence before this Court that the Father will not be able to support on an income of this size over the coming years. In light of the fact that the 2008 year was an extraordinary year for the father given his severance package, it would be unfair to have the father continue to provide support on the basis of an income in that sum when the evidence is clear he will earn income of approximately $100,000 less than that amount.

Background [4] On Wednesday, September 23, 1999, Dexter, the Intended Plaintiff, filed an interlocutory notice ex parte application against ""Persons Unnamed Intended Defendant(s)"", seeking an interim injunction to restrain the Intended, Defendant(s) ""and each of their servants, agents, representatives and employees, and any person or persons acting under the instructions of them, or any of them, and any person having notice of this order"", from picketing or otherwise impeding or preventing Dexter, its employees and suppliers, from entering premises located in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality where Dexter was carrying on work. The Union was not joined as a party by Dexter, and was not joined as a party or as an intervener by order of the Supreme Court. The Union, therefore, does not have the status to file an appeal, unless it is first joined in either of these two capacities as a result of the applications presently before me. [28] I am satisfied that the Union’s application to be joined as an intervener pursuant to Rule 62.35 should not be granted, as there is no appeal outstanding to this Court.

[65] A judge of this Court sitting in Chambers does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status pursuant to Rule 8 or to join a person as a party to a proceeding pursuant to Rule 5.04. [66] As the Union was not a party to the original proceeding commenced by Dexter, and has not been joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a judge of the Supreme Court, the Union does not, in my opinion, have any standing to file an appeal.

b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant. However, neither the accused nor the complainant, due to their respective self-induced states of intoxication, had any memory of the sexual intercourse. HELD: The accused was acquitted. 1) The Court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self- induced intoxication. 2) In sexual assault cases, the defence of 'extreme drunkenness' is successful in the rarest of cases. The accused testified that at the time of the assault he was so intoxicated that he was not in conscious state and was incapable of forming any reasonable belief that the complainant was consenting. 3) In the case before me, the accused was found to be guilty of extreme drunkenness. He argued that he didn't even think about having sexual intercourse that involved penetrating the complainant and ejaculating semen into her vagina. He never considered the issue of her consent or lack of it. The Court reviewed the various cases and found that s. 33.1 may not survive the proportionality test in s. justification analysis.  4) The accused raised three potential defences. The first was that the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the complainant did not consent to the sexual relationship. The second was that there was insufficient evidence, independent of the complainant's testimony, from which the only reasonable inference to be drawn was that she had not consented. It is difficult to understand how someone who renders themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through the voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The third defence was that of extreme intoxication. It was found in R. v. Daviault (1994), 138 C.R. (4th) 124 (Ont. C.A.) in which the court allowed an appeal from conviction and ordered a new trial. It did so on the basis that the trial judge failed to adequately consider the defence for honest but mistaken belief in consent by concluding that the person who exercises his right to walk along highway at night in dark clothing had no memory of those events.","[1] The accused is charged with sexual assault pursuant to s. 271 of the Criminal Code.

1994canlii5055.txt,FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel. The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place. He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.,FIAT. The accused applicant applied for a review of theterms of his judicial interim release. He was charged with four counts of defamatory libel under s.300 and 301 of the Code. He and his counsel consented to a judicial interim released order containing certain terms. The picketing prohibition term of his release from custody was considered necessary by the justice who made the order to address the substantial likelihood that the accused would commit a criminal offence if he were not prohibited from picketing prior to his trial. HELD: The application was denied. The existing order stood.,"The accused applicant applies for a review of the
terms of his judicial interim release. I am satisfied in the circumstances and nature of
this case, that the picketing prohibition term imposed by the
justice with the consent of the accused, was reasonably
justified as a condition of the release of the accused from
custody. I am also satisfied that if the amendment is
granted as sought by the accused, there still remains a

HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station.

The accused's continued detention after the purported “de facto” arrest constituted a de facto arrest as described in Latimer. 2) The accused misunderstood his actual status in any way, or that he was prejudiced by the 'uncertainty' resulting in the unjustified search or seizure resulting in a violation of his rights under the Charter. In the present case the accused was not only put in direct contact with counsel by telephone but was also put in contact with legal aid duty counsel. He was given the opportunity to consult counsel and treated in all respects as though he was in custody after an arrest.","2. The purpose of the voir dire was to hear and determine an application by counsel for the accused, for a ruling finding that the rights of the accused under sections 8, 9, and 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter had been infringed. [23] In the present case, the accused was not only put in direct contact with Legal Aid duty counsel after having said that legal aid was fine, but he had the immediate and reasonable opportunity to contact a particular Legal Aid lawyer by requesting her by name from another legal aid lawyer. [37] In summary, I find that the initial arrest by Constable Epp was lawful, was not terminated by the purported “un-arrest” of the accused, and continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. Even if I were in error in that finding, his continued detention after the purported “un-arrest” constituted a “de facto” arrest as described in Latimer.

It seems to me however, that when a judge attends a court convened conference, receives input and recommendations from various parties, and is mandated to consider them during the course of deliberations in arriving at an appropriate youth sentence, it is, prima facie, a public proceeding. [74] The benefits of an exclusion order, obtaining vital information and recommendations needed to assist the court in arriving at a determination on sentencing, outweighs the deleterious effect of restricting the public’s right to freedom of expression and freedom of the press.

The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer.

The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand.

7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident.

He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident.

It was not an error of law on the part of the defendant. The trial judge was alive to the jurisprudence in raising the issue of whether a witness's testimony should be given to the jury in relation to the testimony of two witnesses. The defendant took the position that the fatal bullet had entered the plaintiff's head, striking the bottom of his right occipital bone and exiting above his right eye. The evidence in this case was that the defendant had asked the plaintiff to change the barrel of the handgun. The plaintiff had received $500 of the stolen money from a friend of the friend who had killed Mr. Byer, who had been employed as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician. He had been charged with the murder of his friend, who was killed in an isolated, abandoned farmyard in 2010. He retained different legal counsel for his appeal. The appellate counsel abandoned the ineffective counsel ground and proceeded solely with the argument that a trial judge erred in law by failing to give the defendant a proper dose of warning. The appeal court also held that there was a risk that the evidence in tandem with the evidence might impair the credibility of the Crown witness who sought to avoid prosecution or incarceration by testifying for the Crown.","Appeal dismissed [1] Daniel Smith was found guilty of the second degree murder of Roger Byer following a trial before a judge and jury.

The trial judge sought input from counsel as to whether Vetrovec warning should be given in relation to the testimony of Ms. Saxon and Mr. Windrum. After lengthy exchange between the Crown and defence counsel, defence counsel not only abruptly withdrew his request for a Vetrochio warning but insisted that it not be given. The defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed.  1) The defendant took the stand in his own defence. His version of events leading up to his interaction with Mr. Byer and his friend (who had been in the defendant's truck at the time of the murder) largely conformed to that of the Crown's argument. His decision to withdraw his application could only have been based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of the strength of the ballistic and scientific evidence and must be questioned in light of the circumstances of the case to determine whether the trustworthiness of that witness is impaired. 2) In some circumstances the trial judge may have erred in law in failing to give a sufficient warning. However, this factor on its own does not mandate a warning. There is no evidence to support the conclusion that the defendant changed the barrel of the handgun that changed the potential location of the bullet and the time period in which it fired the fatal bullet. The scientific evidence did not support the contention by the Crown that the bullet had changed in such a fashion as to change the barrel at the exact time it was fired. 3) The evidence implicating the defendant in the murder of Mr.Byer was circumstantial at best. The evidence arising from the pre-charge conference and the interaction with the defendant (who was in the driver's seat of his truck when the shooting took place) did not provide sufficient support for the defendant’s argument that a warning should have been given. 4) In the course of reviewing the evidence and assessing the credibility of witnesses who seek to avoid prosecution or incarceration by testifying for the Crown, the defendant fell into an unfair and unjustified trap. The sentencing judge did not give sufficient detail to the jury as to the dangers inherent in their testimony. 5) The court found no error of law on the part of the defendant as a judge as he gave no reasons for his decision not to give the warning. The appeal court also found that the error of a judge in not giving a warning could have been avoided if he had given a warning to other witnesses.","Appeal dismissed [1] Daniel Smith was found guilty of the second degree murder of Roger Byer following a trial before a judge and jury.

The parties cohabited for approximately twelve years. The plaintiff was the owner of a mobile home and her three children from a prior marriage lived in it. For the twelve years between 1975 and 1988, the plaintiff earned $17,409.95 per year. Her income diminished due to reduced hours worked and in 1986 she stopped her employment altogether. Her average earnings over the years were $10,162.95. The constructive trust was found to have met the three requirements to prove an unjust enrichment including that the contribution was sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to an interest in the property and that the defendant was chargeable as a constructive trustee. Awarding the plaintiff $800.00 per month in arrears, that this sum should be accounted for in the amount of $12,000.00. It was found that the plaintiff's contributions to the business of the parties did not constitute unjust enrichment.","The plaintiff seeks an order under the Partition Act, R.S.N.S. 1985 c. 333, for the partition and sale of two properties owned jointly by the parties, a declaration of ownership regarding personal property and a division of other property owned by the defendant based on a constructive trust. That principle is not defeated by the existence of a matrimonial relationship between the parties; but, for the principle to succeed, the facts must display an enrichment, a corresponding deprivation, and the absence of any juristic reason ‑ such as a contract or disposition of law ‑ for the enrichment."" (2) For a plaintiff to prove an unjust enrichment, the plaintiff must meet three requirements:



(a) an enrichment;

(b) a corresponding deprivation;

(c) the absence of any juristic reason for the enrichment. In applying this step‑by‑step analysis to this case I find that Mrs. Keddy has met the three requirements to prove an unjust enrichment.

c_1998canlii12367.txt,"The decision of the Board of Arbitration was held by the chambers judge to be fundamentally flawed in that the majority brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had discarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions. She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable. Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. 2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'. Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky.

The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC.

HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered.

The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years.

The victim, who had recently graduated from high school, was not exposed to family violence or the abuse of drugs or alcohol. The three accused admitted to the offence and gave a statement to the police shortly after his arrest. The Crown sought a DNA order, a firearms prohibition and a forfeiture order in relation to the imitation firearm.

The three accused entered guilty pleas to using an imitation firearm while committing the offences of break and enter with intent to commit the assault on the victim. The victim of the assault was identified as Jesse Manulak, who was the resident of the dwelling house and the accused's step-father. The Crown sought a DNA order, a firearms prohibition and a forfeiture order in relation to the imitation firearm. HELD: A conclusion was reached that the accused should not be excused for their actions as a result of the defendant's potential fraud on them, and that Vigilante justice cannot be countenanced, even if the accused had a valid complaint. The accused were found to be at medium risk to re-offend, given the circumstances of the offence, and the fact that they had all been involved in the offence. The evidence showed that the defendant, who had a previous criminal record for driving while over.08, had a significant criminal record.","[53] Mr. Cowan did not file a victim impact statement with the court and he was not overly co-operative with the Crown once he was out of custody. Mr. Cowan did not file a victim impact statement with the court, but I am prepared to draw the inference that this event would have been terrifying. They were heavily intoxicated, which in and of itself is not a mitigating factor, but the fact of their intoxication negatives any clear intention to commit this crime. [88] Mr. Manulak accepted responsibility for his actions early on and gave a statement to the police. [97] The aggravating factors which apply to all three accused are that they entered Mr. Cowan’s residence by breaking a window. Mr. Cowan has some lasting injuries as a result of losing three to four teeth. [114] In light of the position taken by the Court of Appeal in Debigare, and considering the principles of parity, I am prepared to extend leniency to Mr. Hill, Mr. Manulak and to Mr. Foster. [117] Accordingly, I sentence Mr. Hill to a period of incarceration of ten months followed by a period of probation for eighteen months. 6. He shall have no contact directly or indirectly with Scott Cowan except through a member of a law society in Canada. There will be an order forfeiting the imitation firearm pursuant to s. 491(1) of the Criminal Code.

He shall have no contact directly or indirectly with Scott Cowan except through a member of a law society in Canada.

The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him. The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years. The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth. The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge.

The victim had suffered significant injuries as a result of the assault. The three accused admitted to the assault and gave a statement to the police shortly after his arrest.

On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1.

The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights.

The MPA does not apply to the appellant nor the respondent because they do not come within the definition in the Family Maintenance Act. Changes in the law of the marriage did not affect the right of the wife to seek support from her husband after divorce or separation. The right to spousal support arises only at the end of marriage. Before that, each spouse retains title to whatever property is in their name and they may freely dispose of it without the other spouse. For several decades after its adoption, all property owned by each spouse was considered to belong to the wife exclusively or to the husband exclusively, unless they had expressly obtained legal title together as co-owners of the property. The concept of separate property, which assumed each spouse to be equally positioned to earn an income and acquire property, was revealed to be inadequate at both practical and psychological level.

If a child is found to need protection, the court is required to look firstly at s.38(1), which requires determination of whether or not the children should be returned to parent, placed with a person of sufficient interest, or with the Minister for a temporary period of time. In this case the Court concluded that the parents did not pose a risk to their children. 3) The Court ordered that the boys should be apprehended and placed in the custody of the Minister until they were 18 years of age. The Family Services worker responsible for the Ministry's child and child welfare services (MSS) concerns for Michael and Laura were a factor in the decision to allow the boys to stay with the Stevens.

In this case, the Court was able to conclude that the parents' approach to their children was the one that led them to be placed in the foster home. It was also important to establish the criteria for placing the children with the SCC in such circumstances.",0.5335365853658537

At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: unlawfully possess a controlled substance included in Schedule 1 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act; unlawfully have in his possession property (or proceeds of property), to wit: cash of a value exceeding $5,000 knowing that all of the property was obtained (or derived directly or indirectly) as a result of the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code; and for the purposes of trafficking having regard to the principles and objectives of sentencing. The accused had a serious prior conviction record for drug trafficking and conspiracy to do so as well as a number of drug related offences. He had nine prior drug related convictions since 1999, two for trafficking and one for conspiracy to traffic which resulted him receiving a sentence of 5 years in the penitentiary; his pre-trial detention was in part the result of a failed preliminary hearing date which saw the prosecutor unable to reach Estevan. The aggravating circumstances in this case were that the amount of marijuana and cocaine found in the accused's possession was admittedly for the purpose of trafficking. The amount of cash (almost $30,000.00) was found to be part of the proceeds of the trafficking.","[1] On December 13, 2011, the accused, Philip Edward Mullins was found guilty of three counts contained in an Amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: Count 1: That he, on or about the 25th day of August, 2010, at or near Estevan Saskatchewan, did unlawfully possess a controlled substance included in Schedule 1 to wit: cocaine (benzoylmethylecgonine) for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to section 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Count 2: That he, on or about the 25th day of August, 2010, at or near Estevan Saskatchewan, did unlawfully possess a controlled substance included in Schedule I to wit: cannabis (marihuana) for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to section 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Count 3: That he, on or about the 25th day of August, 2010, at or near Estevan Saskatchewan, did unlawfully have in his possession property (or proceeds of property), to wit: cash of a value exceeding $5,000.00 knowing that all (or part) of the property was obtained (or derived directly or indirectly) as a result of the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to section 354 and 355 (a) of the Criminal Code.

The material change threshold had not been met. 2)The respondent was to continue to be the sole custodian of the child. What remains to be determined upon this application are the matters of custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. 3)The 1995 judgment was no longer appropriate. The existing access order allows the respondent to define the extent of access or time spent with each of her parents. 4)The fact that the respondent is 15 years old does not mean that he is not in the child's best interests. 5)The mere passage of time, in this instance nine years, would constitute material change of circumstance relevant to custody. The present application is dismissed.","Wayne Dorosh applies to vary the custody and child support order of May 2, 1995. Mr. Dorosh seeks to vary the custody order on the basis that his daughter, Letitia, born August 22, 1989, (currently 14 years old) wished to spend more time with him. I dismiss Mr. Dorosh’s application to vary child support and arrears. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. [34] Based upon this medical evidence I cannot conclude that Mr. Dorosh’s generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his own control—that is, Dr. Hatfield does not say that Mr. Dorosh was, is or will be incurable.

The respondent applied to vary the support and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 judgment. The 1995 judgment provided for the divorce of the petitioner and distribution of matrimonial property estate to the couple as well as custody, access and support for the child of the marriage. At issue was whether there should be a variation of the custody order. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent was, as of August 2003, 10 months in arrears of child support. 2)The mere passage of time would constitute a material change of circumstance relevant to custody. The fact that the respondent was 15 years old at the time of the 1995 judgment did not disqualify him from the application. 3)The present application is dismissed. There is no change to the material change in circumstances of custody.

The solicitors brought a motion for non-suit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 278A. HELD: The motion for a non-suit was granted. The claim was dismissed.

The rule provides that the defendant may, without being called upon to elect whether he will call evidence, move for dismissal of the action. HELD: The application for dismissal is dismissed with costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 to the defendants. 1)The plaintiff's claim and the evidence she did present at this trial dealt with the very complicated issue of the duty of care owed and the breach of that duty by the defendant lawyers in respect of the preparation for and conduct of the defendant's trial in what is known as a prosecution for quasi-criminal statutory offence (QPRA). 2)There was no expert evidence presented by the plaintiff to the jury to provide the jury with the competence to reach the conclusion on this critical issue.  3)The trial judge by weighing the evidence and deciding the substantive issue of causation applied the higher test of the balance of probabilities rather than the lower standard for non susuit. The plaintiff's argument is persuasive and must prevail. 4)The court was satisfied that there was no evidence upon which an expert evidence would be useful to assist the jury in the prospective deliberations and ultimate verdict in this case.  5)It is generally accepted that when doctor acts in accordance with recognized and respectable practice of the profession, he or she will not be found to be negligent. This is because courts do not ordinarily have the expertise to tell professionals that they are not behaving appropriately in their field. It is also well settled that the question of the standard of care that is applicable in professional negligence cases is a question of law and to that extent it is the trial judge's responsibility to articulate that standard as part of the judge's charge to the general public. The Court was also satisfied that the failure to call an available expert witness to testify at the original civil trial was the only thing that could have been considered by the jury as a sufficient evidence to support a finding of professional negligence by a jury. 5)The Court was awarded judgment against the defendants in the matter of Hagblom v. Henderson and Campbell (2003 SKCA 40). The case concerned the first threshold issue, which was whether there was any evidence, if left uncontradicted, to satisfy a reasonable person.  6)Costs of the trial were awarded to the plaintiffs. 7)The plaintiffs were given the opportunity to plead and/or call witnesses.","[1] After the completion of the plaintiff’s case in this civil trial by judge and jury, counsel for the defendants presented this motion for non-suit pursuant to Rule 278A of The Queen’s Bench Rules.

The jury has no evidence upon which they could possibly render a competent verdict upon the disparate facts relied upon by the plaintiffs in the evidence that she and her husband gave at the trial. 3) The plaintiff's claim and the evidence she did present at this trial dealt with the very complicated issue of whether the duty of care owed and the breach of that duty by the defendant lawyers in respect of the preparation for and conduct of plaintiff's trial in what is known as a prosecution for quasi-criminal statutory offence(s) (Ries Estate). The issues raised involve substantial legal expertise and judgment including knowledge of the legal rules of admissibility respecting the evidence of witnesses, the identification of legal issues likely to be raised at trial, the appropriate strategy to address those legal issues and the judgments and decisions taken in pursuit of that strategy all are complex and important professional judgments to be made by the trial lawyer.  4) The court was awarded its costs of the motion in the context of column V.

The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay. There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges.","FIAT: The accused applies for an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada quashing Count #1 of the indictment on the ground that it applies to more than one single transaction; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. HELD: The application to quash counts #1 and #2 is dismissed. In light of the Crown’s decision not to proceed with the trial of the co-accused, who was convicted on a charge of defrauding ICC of money in excess of $1,000 contrary to ss. 380(1)(a) and s. 7 and 24(1), the Crown is not bound by any factual or legal determinations made by the trial judge in Schafer. There was clearly no promise by the Crown that it would be bound in its proceedings against the applicant by the findings of Klebuc J. in relation to the current indictment. It was more beneficial to both the accused and the Crown to have the benefit of the judgment in the Schafer matter before proceeding with the Leibel trial. The Crown offered to consider an application to separate the indictment from the indictment if the accused could show that it was prejudicial to put the complex indictment to a jury. The applicant opposed this application on the basis that it raised a question substantively different from that determined by Matheson J. but ordered that the Crown provide particulars (as it now has done in the amended indictment). The applicant argued that his agreement to waive any objections to delay until the outcome of the trial was known was given on the common understanding and expectation the Crown would carefully consider those findings and reassess its position in light of them, and, further, that it preferred to await the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada on that basis. It is common ground that the crown takes the position that it is more than bound by the conclusions of a trial judge with respect to certain matters but preferred to wait to hear from the Crown once they have been decided.

The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths.

This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a).

Mr Black has brought motions (the “Charter Motions”) seeking a stay of those charges on the basis that his rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated by the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy (“OSB”) and by the R.C.M.P. during investigations of his activities and of the administration of the NsC bankruptcy. The present application could be characterized as a request for re-consideration of the decision to quash the Subpoena, in light of additional information which Mr Black says has become available during subsequent testimony and from the documents which have now been provided.

The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction.

The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor.

Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay.

A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused was on duty in a marked police car when the accused's vehicle rolled forward and collided with another vehicle. The second part of the Sault Ste. Marie test was whether the accused exercised due diligence applying an objective test in assessing carelessness and whether he has then shown, on balance of probabilities, that he exercised Due diligence in the context of the circumstances he encountered. The actions of the accused which could be considered careless are the speed at which he drove past the stopped vehicle, the location of the cross-walk, and his driving forward into the other vehicle. HELD: The officer who stopped his vehicle was found not guilty of this charge. 1) The officer's evidence was that he did not touch the accelerator, and briefly took his foot off the brake, and then immediately reapplied the brake after seeing the vehicle which was positioned directly in front of the police car at the time. The Crown suggested that the officer thought the vehicle could slow down and that the vehicle did not accelerate and did not move forward quickly before striking the accused. The officer was acquitted of all charges. 2) The accused's actions in operating his vehicle on the road beside a stopped vehicle were careless. The police officer who had stopped to assist a person who had been injured in a store did so in good faith. There was no other reason on the evidence presented for the officer to stop his vehicle. He was crossing a parking lot when he was struck. The pedestrian crossing road adjacent to the parking lot was a cross walk and the accused was crossing it when he entered the store.

The accused was on duty in a marked police car when the accused's vehicle rolled forward and collided with another vehicle. The second part of the Sault Ste. Marie test was whether the accused exercised due diligence applying an objective test in assessing carelessness and whether he has then shown, on balance of probabilities, that he exercised Due diligence in the context of the circumstances he encountered. The actions of the accused which could be considered careless are the speed at which he drove past the stopped vehicle, the location of the cross-walk, and his driving forward into the other vehicle. HELD: The officer was found not guilty of this charge. 1) The officer's evidence was that he did not touch the accelerator, and briefly took his foot off the brake, and then immediately reapplied the brake after seeing the other officer's vehicle. This vehicle only moved a short distance forward before striking the accused. The officer did not gesture or give any other cause for concern other than the complainant's statement to his wife that the vehicle could slow down. The Crown suggested that the accused had an oblique motive for doing so, perhaps thinking that the officer was being insolent and returning to set him straight. The defence suggested the accused should have simply continued driving. 2) The accused's evidence that neither was waving their arms or giving any other reason other than that of a person they later determined to be a'sir' did not lock upon impact. The Court was satisfied that the Crown had proved the accused drove careless. There could be no other reason on the evidence presented for the officer to have stopped his vehicle. He was crossing a parking lot when he was struck by the vehicle. As he was crossing the road, he was asked to assist another officer on a non-priority matter. He reversed his vehicle and crossed the street directly in front of the police vehicle.

The police believed that the accused sexually assaulted the complainant or alternatively had sexual contact with her while in position of trust and that it would be advantageous to their investigation to intercept telephone communication between the complainant and the accused wherein the complainant would attempt to engage the accused in conversation concerning the alleged improper activity. An authorization to intercept private communications was obtained from a Provincial Court judge. The complainant consented to the interception of the private communications and did in fact contact the accused and engage him in conversation that was surreptitiously intercepted by the police. The accused argued that the evidence of the conversation was inadmissible because it was irrelevant. The learned judge who issued the authorization did so in error because there was no basis upon which he could conclude there were reasonable grounds to believe that information concerning the offences would be obtained through the interception sought. HELD: The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not violate the accused's s.8 rights. Even if the offence was a serious one and was inadvertent, the breach did not lead to automatic exclusion under s. 24(2). The accused's application to exclude the evidence was dismissed. 1)There was insufficient evidence before the judge to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The judge did have sufficient evidence before him to issue it. 2)The breach was not serious or inadvertent and the evidence collected was limited to those specified offences. 3)The Court reviewed the provisions of the Criminal Code and there were case law violations and determined that the breach was non-conscriptive. 4)The evidence obtained pursuant to a valid authorization for intercept of private communications contained the following provision: 4.The participant telephone intercept conducted without judicial authorization was found to be in contravention of s.271(1) and 273.1(2)(c) of the Code. It is reasonable to presume that information related to the offence would be obtain through an interception sought when the complainant engaged the male in conversation involving their alleged sexual activity. The evidence obtained should be excluded. 5)After analyzing the provisions in R. v. Wijesinha and therelevant case authorities, the Court concluded that there is no Charter breach and that theevidence is in fact admissible and ought not to be excluded pursuant to S.24(1). 6)The information obtained as a result of the intercepted private communications may be traced back to the time the authorization was obtained. 7)The accused had sufficient evidence to admit the evidence.","[1] This is an application by the accused, Wendell Willick, for an order that

does not violate the accused's s. 8 rights. disrepute. Therefore, the accused's applications are dismissed.",0.5487646293888166,0.6504237288135593,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) and s. 273(2)(c) of the Canada Act being Schedule B to the Charter. The accused argued that the evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception was inadmissible because it was irrelevant. HELD: The accused's application was dismissed. 1)The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not violate the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. 2)The accused's argument that the police purposely navigated around the fact that offences under s. 153(1)(a) are not eligible for intercept was not supported by the evidence. The fact that the accused was denied his right to choose his audience does not mean that what he said to the complainant was compelled. The surreptitious recording did not compel or coerce the appellant to speak. The recording was not conscriptive evidence in the sense described in Stillman. 3)The Court did not conduct a review de novo. This court was not mandated to second-guess the issuing judge but must merely examine the original material in order to determine whether there was an appropriate basis for the order. The intercepted communication was non-conscriptive. 4)Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s.8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered to be non-consecutive evidence. 5)In this case if there was a breach it was not serious and was inadvertent. There was no evidence of bad faith. The Court viewed the seriousness of the breach to be minimal and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 6)There was no Charter breach. The evidence was admissible and ought not to be excluded. 7)The breach did not breach the Charter at all. 8 is a Charter offence. The Act specifies the offences for which private communications may be intercepted and the evidence collected is limited to those specified offences. 8)The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications between the complainant and the accused wherein the complainant would attempt to engage the accused in conversation concerning the alleged improper activity. There is no evidence that information concerning the offence would be obtained through the interception sought when the complainant engaged the accused and engaged him in conversation involving their alleged sexual activity. As a result, there is no breach of s8. 8. The reason the accused chose not to issue an exclusion order was because the judge had sufficient evidence before him to issue the warrantless intercept authorization. 8","[1] This is an application by the accused, Wendell Willick, for an order that

It was a business decision made by accused persons who are asked to cooperate.

However, in this case the Court was satisfied that the reliability threshold is not met, even if the witness is sworn and warned prior to giving the statement, when it is subsequently known that at least a portion of that statement is false. The form of demeanour evidence is video tape. It is not possible to substitute an oath where appropriate substitutes for the oath exist. The present evidence does not support the allegation that the witness has been induced to lie. 2)There was insufficient solemnity attached to the occasion of her swearing the affidavit, to bring home to her the truth, that the oath she was taking would have the same effect as if she was testifying in court before a judge.
