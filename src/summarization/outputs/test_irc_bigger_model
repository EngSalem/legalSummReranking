b_2005nssf21.txt,"The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the irproperty. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.","The parties agreed that a Joint Custody Order was to be issued for the three children, with primary care to be with the mother. The father opposed the payment of spousal support but sought authorization to obtain passports for the children. Both were firmly settled into their local community. The mother was prepared to consult but wanted the final say when they could not agree. Significant decrease in value over 9 months. Ordering that the parties share joint custody of the children, that day-to-day primary care shall be with Ellen, and that the father shall pay basic guideline support for $986 per month. There was no evidence that the parents posed a flight risk to the children as their children had always been settled in the local community and their position that the children would not suffer any economic disadvantage due to the breakdown of the marriage, was based upon the fact the children had been involved in many extracurricular activities for the past few years, and the couple considered the property a joint business operated for the benefit of the family."
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","The Director of the RCMP applied for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 to the Crown in right of Saskatchewan. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from the defendant in 2008. Since the defendant filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act. HELD: The application was granted. The starting point for the commencement of the limitation period is not the date of seizure as contended by the plaintiff but the date that the director became satisfied that the property constituted proceeds of unlawful activity. The Court accepted the applicant as an expert witness. The legislation is civil not criminal in nature, and the legislation is an in rem remedy. The date of charges is irrelevant as is the need for a finding of criminal culpability. There is no retroactivity problem."
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT. The father was ordered to pay child support of $600 per month for the child. He applied to reduce his support obligation and rescind arrears which accumulated under the 1996 order. The primary questions to be answered were: 1) what is the father's current income; 2) is the mother underemployed; 3) if the child support is retroactive, should the application be granted to either the petitioner or the mother; 4) the history of this variation application and the factual context in which the questions will be determined. HELD: The father's decision to work a minimum amount each year and to only work three months of the year is not a reasonable decision when he has a continuing obligation to provide support for his child, Stephanie. It is very likely that his financial position has not changed as result of the order for child support. The difficulty in the matter is determining whether or not Mr. Pilat has, indeed, been successful on this motion. On all of the evidence, it appears that the father has chosen a lifestyle that imputed income to his dependents, is intentionally imputing income to them, and has made this decision to severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. It appears that he has made a conscious decision to impute income to the dependents within the meaning of s. 19(1)(a) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The family has grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in this proceeding."
7_2006skca94.txt,"The tenants apply pursuant to s. 49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act for leave to appeal a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench reviewing a decision of the Rentalsman. HELD: Application allowed.  1) The parties agree that the rent for July was paid on July 27. The landlord then immediately applied for and was granted a writ of possession. 2) The tenants advise that the landlord holds the equivalent of one month's rent as security for the payment of the last month rent of the tenancy. The landlord claims it is a security deposit. 3) The tenants claim they tendered the arrears on the basis that the landlord would not apply for a writ of possession and that the arrears were accepted on that basis. 4) The Court of Queen's Bench Chambers judge dismissed the appellant's appeal the same day saying 'the rent for August has not been paid and not paid by required time, appeal is dismissed'. 5) The first issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in finding the Rentalsman had jurisdiction to make the order granting possession on the basis that 'the rent was 15 days in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice' if the landlord accepted the rent in lieu of seeking a writ of possession. The second issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid.",The tenants apply pursuant to s.49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act[1] for leave to appeal a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench reviewing a decision the Deputy Rentalsman granted. Her reasons were that the rent was 15 days or more in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant had failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice. The tenants indicate that they could not have agreed to pay the August rent because they would not have been in position to pay future rent on that day. The landlord contradicts this and indicates that it holds $640 as a damage deposit only. The rent for July in the amount of $640 was paid on July 27 plus late payment fee of $25 which the landlord accepted. No further hearing was held. HELD: The application was allowed. 1)The Court of Appeal has jurisdiction derived from s.47 of the Residential Tenancy Act which reads: 49(1)Any person who is aggrieved by decision of a court of law within the jurisdiction of this Court may appeal pursuant to this subsection of this Act or leave to make an order for possession within the court of laws within that jurisdiction.  2)There was no order as to costs.
8_2007skpc1.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings. HELD: 1) There has been a delay of approximately thirty-one months. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather. The Court finds the prejudice to the accused outweighs the public interest in having her tried for the charge. 2) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached on the charges. There is a balance of probabilities between the time the accused was released from custody and the time she was ready to apply for a new trial date. 3) There was no waiver of the delay for the periods of time leading up to and including the date of swearing in. The weather caused delay of 2.5 months. 4) The Court does not accept the Crown's argument that there was a waiver of delay caused by adjournments of the dates of December, 2005 and June 14 2006. Limitations on institutional resources, which had caused delay in this case, are to be considered. 5) The weather was a factor. It was not possible to travel to Buffalo Narrows in the bad weather, which would have caused some delay. The length of delay was attributed to four months. The adjournments were at her request for the purpose of deciding on a defence election and entering plea."
e_2001skqb128.txt,"The mother had custody of the 12 and year olds under the terms of the January 10, 2000 consent judgment. The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","The parties applied to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment, including their contribution to child support and access provisions, pursuant to s. 15.1(3) of the Act, including basic support in the amount of $1,000 per month and an order that the petitioner is not to schedule activities for the children during the respondent's access periods without his consent. The respondent indicated his income was reduced and referred to his 1999 tax return indicating an income of $42,386.34. The petitioner alleged that his mother was no longer available to provide child care on his access weekends. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner. 1)It does not constitute a variation of the custody/access regime but rather a specific directions with respect to execution of the access regime. The analysis begins with examining the framework within which the application to vary must be considered. If the basis of the original order was the imputation of income the respondent has the onus of satisfying the Court that there has been a material change in his condition, means, needs or other circumstances, which if known at the time of consent, would have resulted in a different determination of his income. 2)The Court found that it was not necessary to determine which of the two alternate approaches constituted the basis for the consent judgement as the material question at this time was the same in both instances. The father's income had been reduced and he had not provided any evidence of gifts or income that would make the payments inappropriate. Without evidence of the earlier gifts, there was no evidence of comparing the present circumstance to the past. 3)The respondent provided no evidence as to the amount, the method or when his father provided the gifts. The residue of his estate was left to his wife. His father passed away prior to the pre-trial conference. The allegation is that he has received no gifts since then and his mother is not able to afford to help him with the children."
3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of his cattle getting into the plaintiff's canola field in late July 1999. The plaintiff admitted that his cattle had gotten into the field on one occasion but denied liability for damage caused by his cattle. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment in the amount of $2,533.45 plus pre-judgment interest and costs. Under both the present s.27 (1) and (2) of the pre-1977 statutes the legal situation was the same -- the cattle owner is strictly liable for damage by his straying cattle. The fact remains that the cattle did move onto the field unbeknownst to the defendant, his spouse, his brother, or his hired help. The Carrot River did not prove to be an impediment to the cattle' movement. There was no evidence credibly suggesting that water levels would have hindered the cattle on earlier occasions, any more that it would hinder them on the day they were seen by Mr. Korpach in the canola. Overall net damages were reduced by 5% as the plaintiff failed to establish any wildlife trails or any actual damage to the crop."
b_1995canlii5775.txt,"An application was brought under ss.58 and 59 of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act seeking approval for a proposal made by Gustafson Pontiac Buick. The proposal had received the necessary proportion of support from Gustafson's creditors. One unsecured creditor opposed the application. HELD: 1)Under s. 59(2), before it can approve a proposal, the Court must be satisfied; (a) that the terms are reasonable; (b) that the terms are calculated to benefit the general body of creditors; and (c) that the proposal is made in good faith. 2)In determining whether to approve a proposal, the court must consider not only the wishes and interests of creditors, but also the conduct and interests of the debtor, the interests of the public and future creditors and the requirements of commercial morality. 3)If, however, a large majority of creditors, i.e., substantially in excess of the statutory majority, have voted for acceptance of a proposal, it will take strong reasons for the court to substitute its judgment for that of the creditors. 4)Gustafson had met the criteria set out in the Act and the authorities referred to in Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law of Canada, and accordingly the proposal was approved.","An application pursuant to ss.58 and 59 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for the approval of a proposal made pursuant to s.50 of the Act by Gustafson to its various creditors. The applicant creditor Oak Bluff Estates Ltd. opposed the application for Court approval as it was a separate class of unsecured creditors and, as that class did not approve the proposal, the proposal was not properly approved by the creditors in accordance with s54(2)(d) of the bankruptcy Act or alternatively, that the proposal failed to treat all of the creditors equally. HELD: The Court was prepared to refuse the proposal on the following grounds: 1)The proposal was primarily calculated to benefit Prairie Security Fund and the guarantors of the secured creditors of the corporation and not the general body of creditors. 2)The applicant was presumably in a position to terminate their relationship with the employer at any time.  3)The criteria to be followed by the Court on an application of this nature is set out in ss.59(2)of the Act. 4)The Court must consider not only the wishes and interests of creditors but also the conduct and interest of the debtor, the public and future creditors and the requirements of commercial morality. 5)The Act contemplates only three categories of creditors preferred, secured and unrated. The proposal is effectively nothing more than a 'holding proposal'."
3_2002skqb54.txt,"The wife sought an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. They married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in 1997. Each had significant assets at the time of the marriage, which had increased in value. They agreed at the time of the marriage to keep their assets separate and to not make a claim on the assets of the other and that their entire estates would be left to their respective children.  The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths. HELD: The wife was entitled to judgment for $54,000. 1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention. This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home. The Melville residence owned by the wife at the time of the marriage was exempt in accordance with their agreement. It had not increased in value and the wife solely paid its maintenance. 3)No costs.","The petitioner seeks an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. The parties married in 1988 and separated in December 1997. Each of the parties had significant assets at the time of the marriage which have increased since that date. They agreed after their deaths their entire estates would be left to their respective children. They each completed new wills shortly after the marriage. HELD: 1)The petitioner was entitled to judgment for half of the value of the assets acquired after marriage being that of the condominium, $42,000 with half of its value being the furniture, vehicle and camper. 2)There was no conflict in the parties' evidence as to the verbal agreement they made during the marriage that they would separate and not make claim on the assets of the other. There was no evidence of any extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1) of the Act. The condominium has not increased in value and the maintenance thereof was born solely by the petitioner during the years of marriage.  3)The court was not satisfied there was any 'extraordinary circumstance' (see s.20 of The Family Property Act s.16(3)). The court considered that the marriage was practically bound by verbal agreement. The fact that the parties separated after marriage leads to the fact that there is no verbal intention of distribution between the spouses to the present day. There should be, however, be some consideration of whether or not there should be distribution at all."
c_1997canlii9802.txt,"An appeal from an order which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board (LRB) pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the LRB and even though it had no power to make a final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","This appeal was from an order of a Labour Relations Board which quashed an interim order pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the labour Relations Board, and even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs in the usual way. 1)Whether one approaches the question from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s.5.3, or from the context of the entire statute, or a purposive approach, the result is the same. The chambers judge arrived at a correct conclusion.  2)The ordinary meaning of words s. 5.3 require two conditions for the exercise of the power: the existence of an application or complaint before the Labour Relations board, and its existence of power in the Board to make final order in respect of the application. 3)The section contains no words directly limiting the terms 'application or complaint', nor is there anything in s.25 or the other sections of the Act dealing with resolution of disputes by arbitration to indicate an intention to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements."
e_2007skpc90.txt,"The plaintiff sues the defendant town for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst in the basement. Her contention is that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The Town of Martensville disputes that such instructions were given and that, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not a result of the water not being turned off, but rather because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. There was no order as to costs. 1)There was a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. This cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes, the court found. 2)The plaintiff was not attended to by her daughter. It would be impossible for her to have her daughter attend to deal with the damage to the property. The court calculated that the plaintiff's action could only succeed because of the lack of clear instructions given to the town to disconnect the water service. The form executed by the plaintiff clearly indicated a request for final billing. This could not be construed negligence by the Town nor was it negligence in any circumstances."
6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff, now Sylvia Schira, decided to purchase a home. She sought recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She engaged the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant, 100% Realty Associates Ltd. After lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased the property in 1998. It was owned by the defendants, Edward and Verl Karpinski. Their realtor was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The defendants also claimed aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against them for failing to give the plaintiff a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. The PCDS was incorporated into the PCDS in the event that any defects existed. The realtor and her husband were liable to the plaintiff in damages in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the parties."
7_2001nssc49.txt,"The parties were divorced two years ago and the matter had been finalized by an appeal decision in June, 1999. Both parties made application to vary child support on the basis of changes (ups and downs) in the farming business. The respondent wife, who recently purchased a house, also applied for lump sum spousal support which claim had been disallowed by the Court of Appeal. Monthly spousal support terminated as wife now self-sufficient; child support increased due to increase in husband's income; lump sum payment of $8,000 awarded to wife to help pay her relocation expenses from move with husband given six months to pay lump sum, but monthly spousal support to continue until the $8,000 was paid in full. Applications to vary should not be entertained simply because of the usual ups and downs of the farming business; the court must strive to average out the individual's ability to pay in such circumstances in order to ensure stability of payments for both parties. Lump sum spousal support payments must not have the effect of a significant redistribution of the division of matrimonial property but the reasons for the belated application must be examined.","The parties applied to vary spousal and/or child support less than 2 years after being divorced and less than 1 year after the Court of Appeal decision which settled the support awards of the trial judge. The husband originally claimed material change in circumstances based on his poor farming results in 1999 and the wife's improved employment and income situation. She now relies on a change in the husband's income position only. The wife has counter-claimed on the basis that the husband has increased his income since the trial in 1998 primarily because better up to date financial information is now available and because the husband received significant farm aid. She seeks a lump sum award to compensate for her relocation expenses. HELD: 1) The husband shall pay child support of $8,000 per month. Considering the moving expenses and the tax consequences of cashing in RRSP's and other expenses such as furniture, etc., the court found that a lump-sum award of this amount was warranted.  2) The parties had not addressed the question of costs directly pending the court's decision. It would appear that the great deal of expense has been incurred by both parties on these applications to vary. Costs may be difficult to justify but one would encourage the parties to explore some form of mediation if they had difficulty reaching an agreement in the future. 3) The Husband's income for support purposes is $41,000. He shall pay $567.00 per month in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guides. There should be stability of payments, both for the recipient and the payor. Expenses incurred due to the application to vary are material and should be taken into account. There will obviously be need for future adjustments as circumstances evolve with the growing children. However, the circumstances do not justify this expanded request."

In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial. The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify. Due to the delay in obtaining authority to serve an out of town subpoena in New Brunswick, the Crown was unable to serve the victim until three days before trial. The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend. An adjournment was granted. The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction. Dismissing the application. It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code. Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion. If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ. In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment. There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown.","The applicant applied for an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that the judge and other provincial court judge could not hear the trial of Queen v. Jessome. Dismissing the application, that the court has made a discretionary decision based on submissions of counsel.

HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to pay maintenance was reduced to $1 per month and the arrears accruing after the date of his assignment into bankruptcy were cancelled.  2)The wife's counsel requested that the court value and divide all of the matrimonial property equally notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because she might pursue a constructive trust claim for her 1/2 share as against the husband's trustee. 3)The court valued all of the matrimonial property and determined that 56% of this value should be paid to the wife, and only 44% to the husband, given amounts he had spent since the separation.  4)The court left unresolved the issue of which matrimonial assets might be exempt under the Bankruptcy Act and therefore available to the wife.","In November 1993 following a trial involving the divorce of the parties, including a corollary relief on such questions as spousal maintenance and division of matrimonial property, a judgment left the issue of the division of property until a later date. The petitioner did not resume livestock operation on the farm as he required surgery on his back and became even worse in 1994. As a result a hearing date was set for May 13 at which time the respondent was asked in accordance with the prior judgment to complete the division. The wife filed a motion seeking a variation of the November 1993 Spousal Maintenance order in light of his bankrupt financial situation and his inability to earn any income at this time. HELD: 1)Division of property based on asset values which are at this stage problematical. 2)The respondent paid $2,300 by way of maintenance out of the proceeds of certain barley he sold privately. The respondent claims this was in violation of the original order prohibiting the sale of any assets of the marriage without consent of the other party or the Court. 3)The wife was entitled to the following set-off: $800 to be included in her share of the Matrimonial Property division in favour of the respondent. 4)The petitioner filed a petition seeking to vary the November maintenance order in relation to his bankruptcy. The court awarded the respondent wife 56% of the estimated asset value and 44% to the wife. 5)Divisions were to be divided based on the respondent's proposed net worth of $97,000 and the value of a 1990 Oldsmobile.

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action. The conclusion of the investigation conducted by the RCMP as a result of the superintendent's investigation order was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution.","The bankrupt made an application for a discharge pursuant to s. 173(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act. He contended that his former business had failed and that pressure from creditors had caused him to look at bankruptcy as the only alternative. Counsel for the bankrupt raised two preliminary objections to the discharge, namely to the use of tax information concerning his common law spouse and the company that she was sole director and ashareholder of. The bankrupt argued that this was a final matter and Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules requires that affidavit evidence must be based upon personal knowledge. The objecting creditor sought a conditional order of discharge requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750.00 from any source to the trustee. He submits that the administration of the Act and the Canada Pension Plan are interlocutory and that there is no evidence of successful prosecution.HELD: 1) The Court was not convinced that the proceedings were final in nature and dismissed the objection. 2) The bankrupt's argument that the Act prevented disclosure was not supported by the evidence. The facts under s.173(1(a)(b)(c)(d)) and s.285(3)(a)) did not exist. 3) There was an investigation conducted by the R.C.M.P. as a result of the superintendent's investigation order. 4) The court found that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution of the bankrupt. 5)The bankrupt was prohibited from disclosing information relating to the bankrupt in any proceeding other than for purposes of reviewing possible court orders. 6) The applicant brought an action against the trustee for breach of fiduciary duty pursuant to the Act.

The facts establish that the defendant was conscientious about safety issues before the accident and had endeavored to address and improve safety at his farm since the tragedy of Boake's death. These plans were in the works before Mr. Boake died, but he was in no condition to be operating equipment, which he needed to do to remove manure to the manure pit, and placed himself at risk.

The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign. In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described. HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. While no accident reconstructionist was available to check the accident scene after the incident, the Crown could have called an expert to testify whether the defence's theory could hypothetically be rational.

The learned trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The appeal is allowed, and the conviction is set aside. The Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellant's counsel argues that, without expert evidence called by the crown to prove that it was not possible for Fleury to have swerved in such a manner to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that Fleury could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he told Cst. Poiré. It seems unlikely that a minivan could make a 90-degree left turn at substantial speed without leaving any tire tracks across the two lanes of traffic. HELD: The appeal and conviction are dismissed. 1) The trial judge was not only unable to conclude the defence's theory that the appellant was travelling on Highway #11 but could also have drawn the conclusion from the accident reconstruction that it could not be drawn from a general accident reconstruction evidence. The accident reconstruction was only an accident reconstruction and could only be drawn with the general knowledge that a vehicle could roll through a stop sign at a high speed. 2) The defence was not able to rely on the experts to draw a rational conclusion from what they had been told at trial. They could only draw the general, but nonsensically, a rational, conclusion from which the court could conclude the appellant drove through the stop sign. 3) The Court would be circumspect about the explanation given by the defence to the Court of Appeal that it would be impossible for the Court to reach the conclusion drawn from what the defence had been called before the accident.

The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion.

Each case must be considered on its own facts. The guiding principle is reasonableness.  4) Although the respondent's initial application had been to eliminate child support arrears, it was acknowledged by his counsel in the pre-trial brief filed and in argument that as a result of his increases in income since the original support order had been made in 2003, and the fact that Keegan only achieved the age in November of 2007, that any retroactive assessment of arrear should take into account these factors. 5) The parties agreed that the respondent was to pay $380 per month plus 33% of s. expenses for support of the said child for the months of September to December 2007. The respondent shall pay $200 per month by monthly payments of $200 in the interim pursuant to the order of December 17, 2007."

The corporations have been very profitable and the retained earnings of both companies far exceed the amount of long term debt.

On March 4, 1999, Tapp obtained a garnishee summons issued prior to judgment against the said defendant and served it on Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (""SPMC""). In April 1999, SPMC served a notice with the registrar of the Court of Queen's Bench of their claim with respect to potential wage claims owing by the defendant company to its employees pursuant to s. 54 of The Labour Standards Act. Tapp then made an ex parte application on May 28, 1999 for payment out of the moneys which had been paid into court by SPMC. The court, however, in view of the third party claim by the Director of Labour Standards directed that the application for payments out should be made by notice of motion and that all parties interested in the funds should be served. HELD: 1)The claim by Tapp was dismissed. No one appeared on behalf of the other parties. The matter was reserved for the decision on that date.  2)The Minister of Labour had not obtained judgment against either company and there was no certificate filed with the court confirming the certificate or issuing the judgment.

He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company (STC) by the former president and chief executive officer of the corporation. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as in the ensuing months. The question is why at the very least the net income of the company should not have been attributed to him on the premise his annual salary was $102,000 rather than $110,000. He resisted the attribution on pragmatic grounds, arguing that the company had not paid him any salary, that there was no guarantee the company was going to earn a profit, that it needed working capital, and so on. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The severance terms of the contract were arrived at with an eye to his earlier service. 2)The trial judge found that the appellant had met his duty to mitigate.

The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received. There will be no costs awarded for this unsuccessful application.","The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. The defendants entered into a mortgage with the plaintiff in 2005 for land described as 'Lot 4, Block 17, Plan No. 85SC07177, Extension 0, Burstall SK. The mortgage was renewed for a year period with a maturity date of March 14, 2008. The plaintiff applied ex parte for an appointment for hearing for hearing of an application for leave to commence an action pursuant to the Land Contracts (Actions) Act for a six month period. In this case the plaintiff did not appear on the scene. HELD: The application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for six months, and on the basis that there is no sale to be confirmed based on the evidence filed. An appointment for the hearing for the application by the proposed plaintiff for leave-to- commence action was premature as 30 clear days had not expired after service on the Provincial Mediation Board prior to the making of the application.

SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply. Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The defendant sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 requiring the plaintiffs to post security for its costs on the ground that Wind Power Inc. was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan and Dove Industries was a corporation incorporated specifically for a wind power demonstration project which did not pay and accordingly had little assets. The plaintiff by himself or his agent alleges by affidavit that he has a good defence on the merits and stating the nature of such defence. HELD: The plaintiff was granted security for costs. 1)There were appropriate circumstances in Thole v. McKenna to deny the defendant an order that the plaintiffs post security. 2)The time to bring the application was at least soon after September 1996. The fact that it was not made until now would have left the plaintiffs with the distinct possibility that, ultimately, the court was not going to be asked by SaskPower to have them furnish security.  3)There are appropriate circumstances (Grotsky J. inThole v.) McKenna for the Court to direct security in either event against either or both of the plaintiffs. 4)The plaintiff shall have one set of costs of the application in any event of the change in venue."
d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The defendant brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order compelling the plaintiff to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant (relating to a test of their premises for contamination). The plaintiffs sought to have the action proceed as a class action. The defendant moved to dismiss the claim against it on the basis that there was no plaintiff named in the statement of claim who purchased a Holguin vacation package from Red Seal. The Plaintiffs opposed the motion. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1) The Court's usual approach to civil litigation does not allow for plaintiff to demand defendant produce plaintiff. Secondary the wording of s.14 and s.24 of our Act in my view precludes this type of pre-certification notice.  2) In this case, the Court reviewed cases from Ontario and found that the service of notice (i.e. the defendant to give notice to the perspective plaintiffs) is limited to actions that have been certified as class actions. 3) It is important to note that this is still an 'action' and not a 'class action'. The Court was trying to determine the relevance of the viability issue in this case. It would appear that the court was concentrating more on common law regarding preliminary conflict objection than it did on remedial legislation. 4) Red Seal has had over the last couple of years ample opportunity to acquaint itself with prospective plaintiffs through'some...lawful manner'. The practice and implementation of the Rule of Court s.12 has been completely suspended for the past few years. The Court has not seen any cases where plaintiff was allowed to cross examine defendant on an affidavit. 5) The application for examination on the Moore affidavit was dismissed because the Court could not broaden the scope of the issue of examination of witnesses prior to certification."
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. The Court reviewed the issues in Rimmer v. Adshead 2004 SKQB 536 and found the appellant's income to be $38,964.37 and found it was incumbent on the respondent on the review application to establish that she was unable to become self sufficient. The proper income for the appellant was still in the neighbourhood of $30,000. He also had the same medical issues and the couples' daughter was still living with him and going to university full time. The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining the respondent at age 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student."

Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The respondent challenged the validity of a search warrant, alleging that it was issued without sufficient information. The judge agreed to quash the warrant and the respondent was acquitted. The Crown appealed, arguing that the judge erred in law by excluding the evidence obtained in the search. Appeal allowed; a new trial ordered. Although the judge attempted to address the totality of the circumstances by applying the so-called Garofoli test, the result of the trial was not necessarily the same as that of the previous trial. The court applied the proper standard of review, applying it to the evidence, and found that the warrant was quashed in error. There was no breach of s.8 of the Charter and no basis on which to exclude the evidence of the Crown. The trial judge's approach to this issue reveals an extricable legal error which we must address."

The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem. They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal. HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs. However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient. The Court held that it was impossible to tell whether the hearing officer considered the tenants' evidence at the hearing, made findings of fact in that regard or whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in this situation. The reasons are inadequate to allow a meaningful review of the decision.","The tenants appeal the decision of the hearing officer under s. 72 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, c.

The Court found the reasons inadequate to allow for meaningful review of the decision and for this reason the matter has been remitted to the hearing officers for re rehearing.  1) The tenants do not dispute that rent is owing, they contend an infestation of bed bugs in the residential premises has made it uninhabitable and forced them to incur personal expense to address this problem. Those facts, they submit, should have been considered in the exercise of their 'just and equitable' discretion.

The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","An application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act.

The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence.

The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. HELD: Leave was granted. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances.

HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision set aside. There was evidence from which the Court could impute income to the respondent in the amountof $27,000, and the child support shall be varied to $510.00 per month in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines. The sum of $1,926.78 currently held by the Maintenance Enforcement Office shall be applied to the arrear. The respondent was to pay $200 per month. The appellant was to have her costs in the usual way."
d_2005nssc322.txt,"The plaintiff, who was injured in a rear-end motor vehicle accident, applied for summary judgment and an interim payment of damages. Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.","The plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle at the time of the accident and claimed damages. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence that contributory negligence was involved, there still had to be a determination of damages to be assessed. Defence counsel went to great detail in his affidavit to show that the plaintiff had not been able to establish the motor vehicle accident resulted in her suffering injuries. In the context of a rear end collision, there was a heavier burden upon the defendant as to liability with damage to the plaintiffs' property and thus the application for summary judgment was allowed. The appeal was allowed and the costs of the appeal were set aside. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence. The affidavits showed that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have enough care or control of his vehicle and consequently the collision occurred. However, when read the material attached to the defendant's affidavits, it was apparent that there were a significant amount of other factors relating to the plaintiff."
9_2012skpc49.txt,"The accused plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault. The victims were his granddaughters. The assaults were alleged to have occurred between 1983 and 1991. A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts. The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 724(3)(e) of the Criminal Code. The evidence of the victims was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions. The Court asked the Court to find that the sexual assaults were repeated acts of abuse over a number of years. The accused agreed that these acts were repeated sexual assaults. The Crown sought to establish the existence of digital penetration. HELD: The Court concluded that the Crown had proved beyond areasonable doubt three facts that were aggravating factors pursuant to s742(3): the Sexual Offences were numerous, that he touched the girls directly on their skin and not just over their clothing, that there was digital penetration by the accused of both victims and that the Court was not to believe his denials. There was no medical evidence or corroboration of the digital penetration and the accused testified that he could not say the frequency of the assaults but did not recall them ever not happening. Based on all of the evidence and applying the McKenzie analysis, it was clear that the the accused's conduct was not an isolated incident or even restricted to a few occasions and the Court found that the acts of sexual assault occurred on every occasion the accused was in the company of the girls. The victim described only a couple of incidents when this occurred. The test is not the number of times digital penetration occurred but the time period when the abuse occurred over a period of years and the difficulties with recalling events of many years ago, do not accept the denial that the act of penetration occurred."

The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","The Crown has now applied, pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act, for an order forfeiting the Lincoln to Her Majesty in Right of Canada. The Crown alleges that the registered owner of the vehicle, who was charged with trafficking in marijuana and possession of marihuana for the purpose of trafficking, consented to the Crown's submission being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture pursuant to S. 20(4) for s. 19(4). HELD: The Crown's application is dismissed. The Court must first consider the gravity of the offence, the personal characteristics of the accused and the extent to which the property is likely to be used in the commission of a designated substance offence. The accused must satisfy the judge that she is innocent of any complicity in the offence of which she was convicted and that she exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied that the property was not likely to have been used in connection with that offence. Further, the Court must satisfy that the accused has not been convicted of any of the designated substance offences and that her efforts to quash the evidence do not constitute cruel and unusual treatment."

For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs.

The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","The father was to pay child support of $2,000 per month for a 19 year old son who had been severely brain injured in a motor vehicle accident.

Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s. 15(1), 24(1) and 52(1)) of the Charter of Rights for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and unconscionable, that they be reinstated as full time members of the respondent immediately and that the respondent pay all compensation due to them as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest and costs of this proceeding. The applicants contended this creates the degree of governmental control to warrant the application of the charter is untenable. The collective agreement between the respondent and the Faculty Association and the collective agreement in effect in 1987 provided that the normal retirement date for the applicant was actually June 30, 1988, which was the date he attained the age of 65. It was not a contract between the applicant and the Association.

1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The plaintiff sought to have the defendant's solicitor disburse funds from mortgage draws and insurance claims to the project. The defendant had received a number of irrevocable letters of direction from the solicitor indicating that the project was financially tight. The plaintiff sought postponements of two of the drawings in order to allow them to be paid off. The first drawing had an overrun and the project at this time had a cash flow problem. The second drawing was of significant concern to the creditors as they were beginning to doubt the viability of the project and the ultimate payment of their accounts. For the plaintiff, that the solicitor had disbursed funds contrary to the letter of direction and that he broke the undertaking contained in that acknowledgement. The amended notice of action filed by the creditors alleged a breach of trust by the defendant in failing to comply with his written direction.

The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 236(a) of the Criminal Code and his guilty plea to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so. The Court found the accused guilty of second degree murder but guilty of manslaughter. The accused had 55 previous convictions, 17 of which were for violent offences. Gordon had shown no remorse since he in a drunken stupor shot his cousin in the head for no apparent reason. There were numerous Gladue factors to be considered in determining the appropriate sentence for the offence of manslaughter, including his extensive criminal record, his present and past criminal records, the strength of his aboriginal heritage and his utterances about white men being rapists and pedophiles."

An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations.

HELD: 1) The defendant pled guilty to a charge of assault causing bodily harm. He was sentenced to a fine of $1,500, placed on probation for 18 months and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of the dental work in the amount of $3,263.30. 2) The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and significant pain for a number of months after the assault. Extensive dental treatment was required and will be required at some point in the future. The plaintiff has minimal scarring. He is awarded general damages of $12,500. 3) The pleadings and the affidavit evidence do not support a substantial award for aggravated damages. However, the photographs graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered. Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers. These circumstances justify an award of aggravated damages in the sum of $2,000. 4) The plaintiff was awarded special damages in the amount of $1,911.70.","The plaintiff was standing with other patrons near the entrance to the pub when he was punched in the face and knocked unconscious by the defendant.

e_2017skqb219.txt,"HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent. They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.","The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother of the two children. The grandmother argues she is person of sufficient interest with respect to the children. Her position is that she and the father should have joint custody of the children but her home be the children's primary residence. She also seeks an order providing her with sole decision-making authority regarding medical care, counselling and education. The father has been living with the grandmother for the past few years and is in the process of obtaining an order for the grandparents to have access together.HELD: 1) An interim order was granted in March 2009 specifying the father would have access with the children for three weekends in a row with no access on the fourth weekend. This agreement was considered an interim arrangement to be tried by the parties. It is clear there were concerns regarding the father's use of alcohol and drugs. His access was stated to be 'no more than one hour every two or three days'. He opposed the mother's claim for custody and her request that the children be designated beneficiaries of any life insurance, pension plan or health care plan he owned and she opposed his request that she be allowed to appoint a person to have custody of them and be guardian of the property upon her death. There was no difficulty in determining that the grandmother was a person with sufficient interest. 2) The designation of the grandmother as Person of sufficient Interest on an interim basis does not bind the court as a result of s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act 1997. The designation is made pursuant to s.6 of the Childrens’ Law Act, 1997. 3) The Court of Appeal was dealing with a request by a third party for access visits with the mother and two boys. He sought an order that he have custody. He was absent for approximately four years. 4) It is not disputed that the father has used drugs. He smoked marijuana and hashish but said he never did meth on a regular basis. When the parties were in the hospital, the father was charged with assault. He indicated he signed a peace bond to 'get it over with'. The father said he had to quit or was fired as result of false allegations being made about him. He said he was not opposed to the grandmother having reasonable and liberal access. The relationship between the father and the children was tumultuous prior to the mother initiating this relationship. However, it is clear from the evidence that he has been seeing the children every second weekend since the death of the mother. This is not a situation where the grandmother could"
b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applied for amendment of the judgment. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs on the basis of Column IV of the Tariff of Costs be reserved on the subject of costs. The issues were: 1) the issue of costs and whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and that substantial offers were made directly to the applicant. The applicant argued that the judge had intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. The respondent argued that there was no evidence before the Court at trial about substantive offers made by the parties; 2) the applicant intended to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of its financial worth. It was now clear that the applicant had always claimed the entire estate but did not have the complete evidence as to all offers made. The application for settlement was dismissed. The court ordered fixed costs in the amount of $47,000, together with disbursements.  3) The Executions Act states that interest runs 'from the time of entering judgment' and not from the date of entering formal judgment. The jurisprudence is clear that court possesses an inherent power to vary its own order so as to carry out what was intended or even to reconsider or withdraw the decision so long as the order has not been perfected. Rule 343A contemplates an amendment to the judgment in these special circumstances. The Court ordered that the respondent pay post-judgment interest at a rate of five percent per annum for the period from March 19, 1999 in accordance with s. 30 of the Executions' Act and until judgment is satisfied.  4) Special circumstances which compel the reconsideration included the respondent's failure to prosecute or defend the action; there is a substantial monetary difference between party and party costs awarded in the judgment and the solicitor-and-client costs claimed by the applicant; the length of time to trial and the number of interim applications were partially attributable to the defendant who continued to make exaggerated claims for the whole estate well past the time when it was appropriate; 5) the respondent has been awaiting the outcome of this application in order to satisfy the judgment;  6) special circumstances which may have led to further litigation (e.g. the trial judge made an offer of settlement in September 1996 but the applicant failed to make any effort to settle the matter; the applicant's conduct was not entirely pure; and the applicant did not make any genuine effort to contribute to the cause of seeking settlement."

The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order that determined after trial that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the appellant's pension plan during negotiations which took place during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: Appeal allowed from the bench with written reasons to follow. 1)The court found that the judge had the power under Queen's Bench Rule 44 to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. 2)The agreement was not a complete agreement. There was nothing in the evidence to indicate the parties intended that each item agreed to was subject to reaching an overall final agreement. 3)The fiat ended: Pre-trial for continuation with respect to maintenance, jewellery and debts of the wife."

The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens. The substantive law governing the proceeding will be the law of the place where the accident occurred and the governing procedural law will be the law of the place of the trial.","The application was for a determination of question of law pursuant to Rule 25.01 and directions as to procedure to govern the future course of conduct of trial. The sole issue was whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia regarding the motor vehicle accident that occurred in the Province of Quebec. The applicants did not really make any submissions of substance concerning forum non conveniens and at the same time the applicants have not provided a lot of information about the circumstances surrounding the accident such as whether there were any witnesses and where they may be resident; whether any of them were seen by doctors; whether they were in the province; whether there was a doctor available to testify at trial. HELD: The application was amended to include an additional claim for costs. The court has nothing before it as to who did what, who agreed to what, and who disagreed with what prior to hearing the application. The substantive law that governs will be the law of the place where the injury occurs. The applicant had chosen Nova Scotia and following the next rule, unless the applicants can show that Nova Scotia is forum non convenediens, the plaintiff's choice of jurisdiction of forum will govern. In the absence of so many facts about the accident and witnesses likely to be called on behalf of the defendant, the court concluded that that was the issue. If there is a procedural problem, a problem arising from procedural law before or during trial, that problem will undoubtedly be determined in accordance with the procedural law of that place, and that is Nova Scotia."
c_1998canlii12344.txt,"At issue was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly having regard for s303(1) of the Rural Municipality Act and how and when notice was given. The company posted the notice of appeal by registered mail the day before the expiration of the 20 day appeal period. The notice arrived at the post office on a Friday, the day after the period expired and was picked up by the administrator the following Monday. The Appeals Committee refused to direct the board of revision to hear the appeal on the basis the company failed to give notice within the period prescribed by s303(1) and concluded that the board did not have the power to extend the time. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The board of revision was directed to hear and determine the assessment appeal. 1)The Committee did not err in deciding the prescribed time period for an appeal could not be extended.  2)The less formal expression 'to give notice to' as used in the Act is a less exacting term than 'to serve notice upon'. Wascana Energy exercised its right of appeal properly, or at least effectively, requiring the board of revision to entertain the appeal.","The question was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly, or at least effectively, having regard for the governing provisions of the statute and the fact of how and when notice of appeal was given. HELD: The appeal from the decision of the Committee was allowed with costs as usual and there was an order directing the board of revisions to hear the company's appeal. 1)The phrase'may give notice in writing' must be taken by implication to allow for notice to be given by means of registered mail. This is less formal expression suggesting less exacting term. Moreover, it is an Act of such commonplace application as to strongly suggest notice might be given via registered mail, applying as it does to almost everyone in every corner of the rural areas of the province. 2)Wascana Energy exercised its right to appeal properly or effectively, requiring the board to entertain the appeal."
3_2002skca102.txt,"The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure. In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible. She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself.","This appeal is from an order made by a Queen's Bench judge prohibiting McMurtry P.C.J. from continuing as trial judge in respect of criminal charges against the respondent Herzberg. Herzberg was charged with impaired driving, driving with a blood-alcohol level exceeding.08, and dangerous driving. He moved for a stay of proceedings on the ground that the Crown had failed to provide adequate disclosure. In response, the Crown filed an affidavit to show that disclosure had been made. The application was dismissed. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. 1)There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court, whether composed of a judge and jury or a jury alone, does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the grounds of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. 2)Every individual charged with a criminal offence is guaranteed the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal. Although it is the presiding judge to ensure a fair hearing, there is no law which guarantees that inadvertent, inadmissible evidence will not be introduced. Even though the Crown was at fault in this case by filing the criminal record in the affidavit, it must be assumed that trial judges fully comprehend those instructions. The Crown did not have to disclose to the trial judge any indication of a criminal record."
5_1998canlii13955.txt,"An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits. The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","The respondent SGI terminated the applicant's income replacement benefits pursuant to s.185 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The applicant applied for an order setting aside the termination of benefits. HELD: The application was granted. The benefits were terminated and the applicant was to be paid a full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. The court found that SGI was not entitled to terminate the benefits under s.207(d), (e), (f) or (g) of the Act. It was not prepared to find that the applicant caused his early discharge from the Yorkton Physiotherapy Secondary Treatment Centre or failed, without valid reason to attend his scheduled assessment at Wascana. The Court found that the termination was appropriate because the applicant had suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine and was in the depths of despair. The injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident were a contributing factor."
6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The jury determined that the plaintiff was constructedively dismissed and awarded the plaintiff $250,000 in damages. In addition to the claim for damages for failure to give reasonable notice of termination, the plaintiff asserted a claim against the defendant for unpaid holiday pay that he alleged was owing to him at the date of termination.HELD: The jury trial was to proceed as to the issue of holiday pay and the amount on which any holiday entitlement should be based, in the event the plaintiff proves he is entitled to holiday pay. The court reviewed the LSA and found that holiday pay should not be based on the wage and truck allowance as it was a wage disguised for the purposes of avoiding paying income tax. The LSA definition does not include an expense allowance and the plaintiff's truck allowance was not included in the calculation of his holiday pay entitlement. As the plaintiff clearly indicated that the $250 portion of his truck allowance, made to avoid paying tax, was not a holiday pay penalty and as such, it would be contrary to public policy for the defendant to appear to endorse his actions by calculating holiday pay on the basis of his wage, truck allowance and travel expenses. Any holiday pay owing to the plaintiff will be calculated only on the plaintiff’s wage. The defendant was to pay the plaintiff holiday pay in lieu of time off."
b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","The applicants applied for relief under s. 300 of the Criminal Code alleging that the accused published a defamatory libel that was likely to injure the reputation of a police officer by exposing him to hatred, contempt or ridicule or that was designed toinsult the police officer knowing that the matter published was false. Application dismissed; s. 301 of the Code constitutes a reasonable limit in free and democratic society on the freedom of expression guaranteed by s. 2(b) of the Charter. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court must consider all expression that is potentially restricted by the Code, not only the expressions involved in this particular case. The threshold test for the application of s.300 is met. The Court must not be diverted by the offensive content of the particular speech giving rise to the Charter challenge."

For the plaintiff, that there is a prima fade duty of care owed by the Department of Transportation to users of highway against reasonably foreseeable hazards, including the falling of trees onto the highway. Further, the defendant had a duty to use a reasonable standard of care in the operation of the hazardous tree removal program. The defendant was negligent in failing to train the inspector properly. The Court referred at length to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Just v. British Columbia. The defendant's claim against the third parties (owners/occupiers of property on which tree stood) was dismissed.","A tree fell on a half ton truck on a public highway near Falmouth, Nova Scotia.

Judge applied the test that the justice of the peace `must be satisfied on reasonable grounds.' Substantial compliance found and warrant upheld.,"The respondent issued a search warrant to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery. The applicants sought an order quashing the warrant on the grounds that the search warrant was unlawfully and invalidly issued in excess of the jurisdiction of the Respondent for the following reasons: (1) the respondent failed to disclose the existence of reasonable and probable grounds to believe the items sought to be seized would be found at the location which was to be the subject of the search; (2) the Information was deficient in the sole ground upon which it was based is hearsay information from a confidential source and no details are provided in support of the informant's opinion or conclusion that such information is reliable.

d_2009skqb70.txt,"At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","In a judgment rendered April 2004 and cited as 2004 SKQB 156 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal referred the matter of the determination of the IRB for the respondent as non-earner as determined pursuant to s. 117 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act and s. 24 of The Personal Injury Benefits Regulations. The parties brought the matter back for further determination because SGI is paying the respondent an amount less than that. Counsel for Montgrand took the position that SGI erred in holding that the income replacement benefit (the IRB) for the deceased should not be less than the amount received for the first 180 days after the accident. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated Montgrand's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s 137 to find the respondent's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. SGI was correct in applying Regulation 102 which states that the interest payable pursuant to Part VIII of the Act is to be calculated in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act. The Court found SGI's interpretation of s 117(4) was inconsistent with the one used by SGI. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions are in keeping with his earning reality. As stated in the previous Montgrand judgment, SGI shall reduce the income substitute benefit by the amount of the disability benefit payable to the victim and not the other types of earners."
c_2007nsca4.txt,"The appellants applied for leave to amend their notice of appeal in regard to an order requiring them to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications. The application was opposed, inter alia, on the basis that the allegations which underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the trial judge, were irrelevant on the application and were not ruled on by the trial judge. Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make. The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","The appellants apply for leave to amend their notice of appeal. Leave is required because the notice was filed more than 20 days ago. The application is opposed by the respondent 2301072 Nova Scotia Limited and the intervenor. As in their view, their arguments in opposition to the amendment relate to the merits of the point raised by it, those arguments are for a panel and not chambers judge to consider. The amendment does not interfere with the date set for filing the appeal book or result in any wasted effort to address the appeal as originally framed."
b_2000skqb36.txt,"The accused, Cote, applied for remedy pursuant to s.24 of the Charter of Rights stating that he was denied the right to be tried on a fraud charge within a reasonable time. Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay. Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.","The accused was committed to stand trial on one of the fraud charges and now applies for a remedy pursuant to s. 24 of the Charter of Rights. The application is based primarily on the accused's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time. HELD: The Court finds that the accused has been prejudiced by the delay. 1) The length of delay has been substantial and sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay. This is not an exceptional case. 2) Given the facts, the inherent time requirements of the case require a 22-month delay from charge to trial. 3) In this case of eight months, the Crown made no disclosure at all. The preliminary hearing was adjourned to September because of scheduling difficulty. The Crown indicated that it was prepared to look at dates in November. In such circumstances, the earliest available five consecutive days of court time in Kamsack was not until Monday February 8. This was a generous period of time which should have given the Crown ample opportunity to provide full disclosure well before commencement of the preliminary hearing. Unfortunately, this did not happen. 4) There is no dispute on the facts that just over 22 months will have passed between the date of the first appearance on May 12 to the third appearance on June when sufficient disclosure had been made to allow the accused to make an informed election. Therefore, the total delay occasioned by the Crown's failure to make timely disclosure amounts to 9 months."

Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed.","The applicant applies for judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. The applicant is a Roma and Romanian national who has resided in Canada since his arrival here exactly eight years ago. Romania seeks the accused's extradition from Canada so that he might serve a three-year prison sentence imposed as a result of his conviction, in that country, for criminally negligent homicide (an offence equivalent to that of manslaughter in Canada).  By this application, the applicant is addressing the fact that he is a former resident of Romania who made a claim for refugee protection pursuant to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. He also submits that his s. 43 submissions to the Minister are not frivolous. The Crown concedes that the accused has met this low threshold. He is a Convention refugee. It is not my place to look behind that status on an application of this nature. In light of the committal order and the sureties proffered by the accused are his common law spouse and member of the Romanian community in Saskatoon, the Court finds that the risk of non-appearance is such that it cannot be sufficiently mitigated by release conditions which, on the materials before the Court, he might be able to meet."

The respondent was ordered to pay periodic child support of $2,000.00 per month retroactive to July 1. An earlier consent order forbade the husband from disposing of farm machinery and the 1994 crop. He had not paid the lump sum ordered in May. The wife now sought to be paid half the value of the crop, $200 per month for each of the children, retroactive July 1, and be denied the right to enter the tools shed and farm yard now that he is finished farming for the year. The Registrar had earlier ordered the respondent to pay monthly child support if he got a job off the farm. An order in May of this year granted the wife exclusive possessionof the parties 'The Tool shed and Other Parts of the Farmyard' (the farm yard) and the respondent was prohibited from accessing her home or her workplace for the first time since May.HELD: The Registrar was not prepared to vary the order of May 27 and the extended order of October 19 which prevented the husbandfrom approaching the home quarter. The evidence presented by the wife was simply her assertion that her husband had been earning money which enables him to pay child support. She also alleged that the harvested crop had negative value. She asked that the court direct that the Registrar allot a trial date acceptable to both parties."

Nor has the plaintiff established any prejudice. 3)The application for an order granting the applicant leave to file third party notice in the within action was granted."
d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposed the application and requested summary trial. HELD: The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as bodyshop foreman and assistant manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The Court found that the plaintiff applied to numerous autobody businesses prior to accepting the employment he did and was not successful in obtaining an equivalent position at an equivalent salary. Taking all factors into account, the Court awarded the plaintiff's damages in the amount of $55,000.00.  1) Rule 488 requires that notice must be given to an employee who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry. Where dismissal does result after one or more warnings, the category of misconduct can be said to change from one of poor attitude to one of disobedience or insubordination. Such is the case in this case. 2) The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavit material filed but rather whether despite the contradictory evidence, the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would not otherwise be unjust to do so. 3) In this case the plaintiff was able to obtain employment within approximately two and one-half months of the end of the notice period given to him by the employer at a wage considerably below what he had earned with the defendant. The court found that taking into account all of the factors considered, the plaintiff put forward a realistic assessment of an appropriate notice period of 7 months. Taking into account the plaintiff’s record for the previous six years and his exemplary conduct during that time, the notice should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there is a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non-managed one."
4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 1,200 postings on his website, which included 11 stories that included 11 described sexual activity between adults and either infants or preteen girls. The moderator of the website encouraged stories and the defendant encouraged others to submit stories. He stated he did not own a computer, had never owned a computer and did not intend to again access the internet. He submitted that his stories were largely fantasies of what he wished to do with those two girls when they were under his roof. Criminal Code s. 161(1) protects the rights of writers, and artists who write sex stories concerning pre-teen girls, which on the scale of written child pornography places it in the upper half of the scale. The fact that the defendant wrote the stories was an important mitigating factor. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years. 1) The Court took into account the mitigating factors referred to in the pre-sentence report, along with the other material relevant to the case. 2) The defendant complied with the terms of his three year probation order. He directly encouraged other to produce similar stories which is an aggravating factor in the offence.  3) There was no evidence that he had any prior criminal record. The Court considered that the factors cited by the counsel for the defence in relation to the distribution of the stories. The sentencing guidelines were set out in R. v. Warn, 2005 ONCJ 417 (CanLII), 5.03 which authorizes the taking of samples from you for forensic DNA analysis."

The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence.

A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused was on duty in a marked police car when the accused's vehicle rolled forward and struck the complainant. The complainant crossed the road outside of the cross-walk and called for other police officers. At trial, the Crown called three witnesses and the accused admitted to driving the vehicle less than one-half-mile (1.8 km/hr) from where it had left the vehicle and then backed up to speak with the complainant before striking him. The defence suggested the accused had an oblique motive for thinking that the complainant was being insolent and returning to set him straight. The Crown argued the vehicle only moved a very short distance forward before striking the complainant, who was directly in front of the officer. The officer testified that he was on call at the time. Accused found not guilty of the charge. The second part of the Sault Ste. Marie test was whether the Crown has proved that the driving by the accused was careless. The Court held that the accused drove within a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerating speed. The offence was in effect careless driving, as distinguished from dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. The actions of the accused who could be considered careless were, first, the speed at which the vehicle passed by the complainant and then the complainant's vehicle. Second, the officer's evidence that he did not touch the accelerator, briefly took his foot off the brake, and then immediately reapplied the brake after seeing the plaintiff's vehicle move was accepted. There could be no other reason on the evidence presented for the officer to stop his vehicle but he did use a raised voice in speaking to his wife and that his voice was overheard by the officer as he asked whether the plaintiff required an ambulance and if so, whether the accused could have reasonably concluded that the plaintiff was in need of assistance. The court found that the officer did exercise due diligence and took reasonable care."

Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along the community of Woods Harbour, Nova Scotia, at the time his driver's license was revoked. He was charged with driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his licence was revoked, contrary to s.287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act. The defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' and 'all terrain vehicle' do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license was irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive the ATV on a highway. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving under s.11 because his ATV was a prohibited vehicle and the Court had no reason to believe that it should be excluded from the definition of the motor vehicle as different intention is expressed and the meaning of the interpretation or definition section is inconsistent with the content or purpose of the enactment."
7_2011skpc143.txt,"The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals. The issue was whether the claims should be issued. HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","The defendant had submitted 18 claims for issuing by the defendant in response to a letter from the plaintiff. The defendant had refused to issue a summons and had responded to the interim decision by letter only two months later. The issues were as follows: whether the claims should be issued on behalf of the plaintiff; whether the defendant should issue summonses requesting an accounting; if an action was commenced for all of the cigarettes sold by some of the on-Reserve stores in Saskatchewan that are subjected to the new Regulations; and whether the plaintiff should bring an application under Queen's Bench Rule 173 to have a claim or portions of claim struck on those or other grounds. HELD: 1) The summons were declined. The manner in which the summons was dealt with was one of the exceptions to the Small Claims Act and the usual procedure of issuing summonses is not the usual way that matters are dealt with in our Court. 2) There was no claim being advanced against any potential defendant other than the Government of Saskatchewan. The other named potential defendants should not have to 'defend' a case where nothing is averred against them. 3) The language used by the lawyer was an attempt to couch the prayer for relief in wording that avoids direct reference to request for declaratory relief, however the substance of the relief remains just that. 4) There were no issues to be decided by the potential issues raised by these claims, and therefore outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court, litigation would have to be done in the Court of Queen’s Bench."

The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home.

There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue.

In 1987 he qualified for a disability pension under the Canada Pension Plan by reason of his mental disability. He lived with a friend and paid no rent. In his financial statement the respondent set out a matrimonial property valued at $488,040. The difference in value relates to a section of land which the petitioner brought into the marriage. The petitioner and children resided in that home. HELD: Relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should not take the form of spousal support. The Federal Child Support Guidelines stipulate a payment of $442 per month. The CSSP benefits would not affect the welfare of the children. There was no requirement that the respondent live in a group home and there was no basis upon which he could order or expect such. As for the matter of luxurious living, the petitioner's expenses are inflated. There is a monthly payment on a bank loan which was obtained to purchase an RRSP and thereby reduce tax liability. The transaction was appropriate, but it must be remembered that there is an off-setting asset which could be sold and reduced loan payments would result. There are monthly expenses of $500 for legal fees. Finally, small economics could be achieved. In the end, have no hesitation in concluding that the petitioner has the means to pay $500."

b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","An application for directions pursuant to s.209 of the Saskatchewan Insurance Act to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend after a motor vehicle accident occurred. At the time, the respondent was on company business and was driving his wife's Honda because his company car had a deflated tire. When the respondent denied coverage and refused to defend the action in the name and on behalf of the insured on the basis of an exclusionary provision in its policy, the chambers judge concluded that the respondent had no duty to defend because the Honda involved was not insured by Royal.

The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach.

e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family, who reside near Maryfield.

The CÉF had no authority to decide whether it would admit any non-Canadian children to attend a fransaskois school in Saskatchewan, and neither it nor the SHRC may inquire into its reasons or interfere with the exercise of its discretion.  1) The Court rejected the parents’ application to strike the statement of claim as an abuse of process.  2) There was no evidence that the parents obstructed or deliberately failed to comply with their obligations under s. 42.1 of The Education Act. The court found that it would be impossible for the plaintiffs to strike their claim for non-compliance with s. 25(1) of The Act. 3) The children were awarded provisional permission for the duration of the school year, subject to conditions including the granting of a service dog to the children. 4) The court awarded the plaintiffs general damages for out-of-pocket expenses, travel expenses, expenses, the cost of training and re-training of the service dog notwithstanding compensation that might otherwise be available in the amount of $100,000."
4_2000canlii2523.txt,"The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval. In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","The land developer after applying for final subdivision approval failed to receive final approval. The land developer applied for a declaration that the application was in fact complete and sought an order of mandamus directing the development officer to issue the final approval.[1] The applicant land developer sought to have the approval granted without meeting the newly incorporated road standards. The development officer found that because it received tentative approval before the new road standard was incorporated, its application should be grandparented and it should only have to meet the road standards as they existed at the time it received the approval. Certiorari granted on the basis of s. 283 of the Municipal Government Act (MGEA) and s. 250(3) of the by-law. The applicant argued that as a matter of law it had a right to have its final approval granted, without the higher road standards, because it relied on the grandparenting section of the MGEA. The municipality relied upon s. 278(1)(f) and (g) which provide for an application for subdivision approval if the proposed subdivision was in accordance with the enactments in effect, (again subject to a non-contentious error in the plan); the applicant was entitled to declaration that its application was complete. The Applicant was also entitled to a declaration on completion of the final subdivision plan. The application for final approval was to be received within two years of the date of the approval of the tentative plan. [2] The facts are neither complicated nor in dispute. The Application in the case at bar was submitted just within the two year mark. The right of appeal is from a refusal. It was a complete application subject to two requirements: (1) the failure to comply with the new roads standards and (2) the completion of one of the courses on a single lots; both of which appeared to be inconsequential. The second requirement was the very subject matter of this hearing. [3] Having ruled in the Applicant's favour on this issue, find therefore that all aspects of s 283 have been met and the Applicant would have been entitled to final approval, even if the Board were to hear this matter by way of appeal, it might not have been able to grant appropriate relief. The decision to declare the application incomplete was therefore set aside. On the same basis, the Applicant is entitled to declarations that the Application for Final subdivision plan approval is received within 2 years from the publication of the first notice advertising the council's intention to adopt or amend the subdivision by-laws.

The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage caused to a construction site under a bridge in Saskatoon. The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit. The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of. HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted. The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party. There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer. There is a causal connection between the cause of action plead in the statement of claim and the third party notice. It is immaterial at this stage that the City may have an absolute defence.","FIAT: This is an application by Saskatchewan Government Insurance on behalf of the defendant for an order pursuant to Rule 107(c) of the Queen's Bench Rules and s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act granting leave to the defendant to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party to this action. The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage to a construction site under the Senator Sid Buckwold Bridge caused as a result of his truck leaving the surface of the road at the head of the bridge going over the guardrail and falling into the excavation pit. The plaintiff alleges the road condition was icy on the exit ramp leading up to the Buckwool Bridge and the City had not taken steps to address the icy road surfaces. To refuse the application under s. of the contributory Neglio Act would result in the requirement for a second litigation process to be commenced, that being by the defendants against the proposed third party claiming contributory negligence. HELD: The application to add Saskatoon was granted as requested. 1)There is yet another ground on which the City is absolved from liability. The Supreme Court of Canada in Lewis recognized that it was entirely permissible for local authority to limit its liability and argued that s. 154(1.1) of The Urban Municipality Act, 1984 states that no action may be brought pursuant to subsection (1) for the recovery of damages caused by a wall, fence, guardrail, railing, curb, pavement markings, traffic control device or barrier. No further action has been taken in these proceedings.  2)There was another ground, namely that the third party notice established prima facie claim against the City and whether there was any prejudice to the plaintiff if the Third Party Claim was grafted onto the plaintiff's action. It is not proper to assess evidence or go into possible defences."

Prior to being sentenced, he spent 13 days on remand and 2 months under house arrest under s.7.1 of the Young Offenders Act. The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused was 15 years of age and had no record. He assisted the police once apprehended. 2)Although another young offender involved in these offences had received a sentence of 9 months open custody, uniformity of sentence was not a factor to be given great weight in comparing dispositions of young offenders. 3)The sentence was increased to 10 months open custody.","A 19 year old youth pled guilty to 16 counts of auto theft, one count of possession of stolen auto and two counts of dangerous driving. He spent 13 days on remand and approximately 2 months under strict parental control on house arrest prior to receiving a disposition of 6 months open custody and 2 years probation. The Crown appeals the disposition arguing it is not fit having regard for the number of offences and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The Youth Court judge counted the time J.M. had spent under house arrest as secure custody and the amount of damage done to vehicles was $21,062.71. 2)J.M.'s principal partner in these auto thefts was [T.D.] who received 8 months' open custody for some 19 auto thefts and attempts. 3)The youth had no criminal record prior to these offences.

d_2007skqb324.txt,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused applies for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant and the evidence ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The evidence is relevant and admissible in that it does not violate the accused's s.8 rights. There is no Charter breach. The accused argues that the evidence obtained pursuant to valid authorization to intercept private communications was validly obtained and executed in a bona fide way and that nothing she said compelled or coerced the appellant to speak. The surreptitious recording was not conscriptive evidence and was properly admitted by the trial judge. The Court reviewed the provisions of the Criminal Code and the relevant case authorities and concluded that there was no breach. There was no evidence of bad faith, which was evident in the transcript, but it was reasonable to presume that such a scenario could quite likely result in the evidence being found highly relevant to the investigation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal and would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The application for exclusion was dismissed. J. M.D. POPESCUL, 1997 CanLII 384 (SCC), 138 C.C.R. (3d) 321, and the Court reviewed R. v. Stillman, [1990] 1 SCC. Section 184.2(3) stipulates that a judge must be satisfied there are reasonable and probable grounds to believe that information will be obtained through the interception of private communications. However, there is no evidence before the Court to suggest or from which it could be inferred that the police purposely navigated around the fact that offences under s 153(1) are not eligible for intercept authorizations. Rather, the police believed they were pursuing an offence under s271(1)(a) and in the course of that lawful intercept process, obtained evidence relevant to that offence. Therefore, there must be sufficient evidence to issue the telephone intercept authorization."
2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","The parties were permanently separated. Now, the petitioner is seeking access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. That child is an 11 year old. HELD: 1) The respondent is a person of sufficient interest to the petitioner. He does not need to establish that he falls within the category of persons having a'sufficient interest' to bring this application. The Court reviewed the factors enumerated in s.2 of the Family Maintenance Act and found that 1) the respondent has demonstrated that he is a Person of sufficient Interest with respect to this child. 2) The petitioner has already had to contend with multiple fathers and multiple siblings. Many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The overriding consideration is the best interests of the child. The relationship spanned years 2000 to 2007. The petitioner provided care for the child, participated in activities with her and was involved with her two younger children. The respondent has previously shown himself to be ineffectual in attempting to harmonize the children of two families. However, the Court found that the petitioner's extended family consisted of her two elder half-brothers, who it would appear were no longer part of her life, and that access is not in the best interest of the petitioner to her. 3) The relationship between the respondent and the petitioner spanned time between the time of the separation of the parties. It is not surprising that the child is doing well in school and the respondent provided child care when the parties lived together. The fact that the respondent is the biological father does not even place him within the class of persons who could be said to have a sufficient interest under the Act. The father of two more children, who were of the same age as the petitioner, has a residence with the petitioner in the residence of the mother of the two children. It would appear that the relationship has spanned a period of time commencing when the petitioner was barely a toddler. Over the years the petitioner has provided care and assistance to the family and has been intermittently involved in their lives. 4) The Court concluded that the presumption that it is in the child's best interests that she have access to him is more consequence to the legal position that he has argued. Even though in other circumstances the respondent may be considered a person who has demonstrated a settled intention to treat the petitioner as his own child, that determination would not elevate him to status greater than that of person having sufficient interest in this proceeding. In this case the presumption lies with the presumption"
e_2011skqb444.txt,"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","HELD: The Court found that the accused was charged with aggravated assault and one count of common assault. The Court considered three elements of the three arguments: 1) that the Crown failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the injuries caused to the victim fell within the definition of a wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life; 2) that knife's actions were done in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code; and 3) that Knife reasonably believed that he was being assaulted. The Crown must establish the mental element; the mens rea requirement for aggravated assault is an objective foresight of bodily harm; and 4) that knives were involved in a joint assault, such that the victim was the recipient of some type of violence. The accused was acquitted of all three elements."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff was the successor corporation of an amalgamation company which included Sweeney Limited. The defendant entered into a letter arrangement with the plaintiff to represent its share of the plaintiff's energy savings. The plaintiff refused to defend and brought a motion to set aside the default judgment on the basis of forum non conveniens. The chambers judge found that the defendant had failed to establish any reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence and, in this case, it was not a mistake or an oversight, as the plaintiff had clearly intended to avoid the jurisdiction of the Nova Scotia court and had in fact prepared and delivered a detailed analysis of the action in both Ontario and Nova Scotia. She concluded that there were a number of triable issues and the defendant was in no position to bring a defence in Ontario. Dismissing the application, that the defendants' default judgment was premature. It was obtained before the time limit for filing an application had expired. In other words, the defendant did not want to lose its present leverage which would allow the defendant to pursue the litigation in Ontario at considerable cost and inconvenience to the plaintiff, who is without any presence there."

The accused, charged with trafficking in a narcotic, sought an order for a judicial stay of proceedings pursuant to s.24(1) and (2) of the Charter on the basis his right under s.11(b) to be tried within a reasonable time has been breached. HELD: The application was dismissed. The delay was not unreasonable.  1)The 25 months between when the charge was laid in May 1996 and the trial date in November 1998 was sufficiant delay to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the delay. Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest. The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay.

He has been employed throughout the period of delay which resulted from his desire to have a ruling made on the conflict of interest alleged solely attributable to the Crown. The Crown did not have a meritorious position. 2)The Court was satisfied the accused's standards of fairness that lawyer who acted on behalf of a client would be allowed to prosecute that same client for an unrelated offence committed less than 2 years following the retainer. There was no evidence on the reason for the delay. It was not known whether it was due to actions of the accused or to the actions of a Crown lawyer. 3)The delay in the circumstances outlined above was not unreasonable.

6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the respondent was entitled to take out a deficiency judgment in the amount of $162,675.99.

The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00. The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment. This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties. The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose. Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001. An adjustment was also made to account for arrears in child support and child support payments.","The parties were married 14 years and separated approximately 14 years later. There was a petition for divorce issued in 1996. There have been a number of Interim Applications and Interim Orders since the separation. The petitioner seeks a divorce judgment. The parties have two children, born in 1996 to the respondent. The respondent indicated that he has $150,000 worth of life insurance available through employment which provides 80 per cent coverage for his children and 20 per cent for Ms. Jessup. In 1998, the respondent commenced employment as a computer consultant. He did not file his return until March 2000. In his proposed employment, the petitioner indicated that she wished to confer term insurance or some other benefit upon her spouse. No date for this application was given. HELD: The petitioner's income for the purposes of child support is fixed at $6,875.00 per month and the Corollary Relief Judgment will be issued within 60 days or thereafter at the present rate for two children of $1,409.07. Pursuant to the terms of the parties' agreement, there was no obligation on the respondent to pay any more than $850 per month for medical and other benefits separate from the post-tax deductions for long term disabilities and the respondent was to retain life insurance for benefits that are substantially provided in Canada through general taxation, indirect taxation and consumption taxation. There would not be any jurisdiction remaining open for the court to make a limited realistic adjustment to the Agreement."
5_1995canlii4187.txt,"This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).","This was an appeal from a conviction for break, enter and theft. The appellant claimed the trial judge erred in law by applying the doctrine mainly because there was no evidence that he was in recent possession of the stolen Chevrolet Blazer. Dismissing the appeal, that although the evidence was circumstantial, the facts he found to be proved led to no other reasonable inference than the guilt of the appellant."

There were 40 questions in total. The Court was asked to relate the questions to 19 factual summaries presented by the Board concerning cases before it. The Court was required to decide whether the questions were the proper subject matter of a stated case. Dismissing the stated case application, that the questions submitted are hypothetical and speculative. They are therefore inappropriate questions for a stated case, which requires that questions must be responsive to the facts and must not be speculative.","Appellant/applicant K.H. LeBlanc and Anne S.

5_1993canlii6695.txt,"The plaintiff applied under Queen's Bench Rule 231 to strike the statements of defence of a corporate and individual defendant for failure to attend scheduled examinations despite service of an appointment and payment of conduct money to their solicitor. The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences. Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution. Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer. This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants. The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors. HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply. He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates. Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks.","The plaintiff applied to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant on the ground that the designated officer of the corporation failed to appear at an examination for discovery on November 23, 1993. The corporation solicitor had previously telephoned the plaintiff's solicitor to schedule examinations for discovery and to obtain statements as to documents. The defendant's solicitor subsequently failed to attend. HELD: The applications were dismissed. 1)The non-attendances did not constitute refusing or neglecting to attend within the meaning of Rule 231. It could not be utilized respecting these particular non- attendances to strike their statements of defence.  2)On the basis of their conduct throughout the whole of these proceedings, the defendants were guilty of contempt of court. The contempt proceedings instituted last spring are still before the court even though they were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants filed statements of defense. The defendants have abused the discretion of the court that was exercised in their favour to set aside judgments obtained against them and to permit them to file defences. Their conduct can be characterized as contemptuous. 3)The defendants were ordered to pay costs to the plaintiff."
1998canlii3382.txt,"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","The court allowed the appeal and directed the action to be stayed pending submission to arbitration. The court found that, where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a collective agreement, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. It held that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the court action to continue. The issue was whether the arbitrator or the court should have jurisdiction to determine whether the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court. The employer appealed. Appeal allowed; the decision of the Chamber judge was not fatal to the employer's argument that the court had no jurisdiction and, in fact, it was open to the parties to raise the issue again."

The issues before the court is interim custody and primary residence of the child, access by the other parent and interim child maintenance. The parties filed evidence that was considerably contradictory relating to each other and respective abilities as parent. viva voce hearing was held to assist determining the questions of credibility. The mother aged 31 years of age, is employed as secretary. The mother remained at home during the first year of the child's birth then returned to work. The mother suffered from post partum depression following the child's birth and as result attempted to commit suicide. She was hospitalized for three weeks to receive psychiatric assistance. The psychiatrist who treated the mother states the mother is unlikely to have future suicide attempts and has responded well to treatment. The child was with the mother every afternoon during her hospitalization and the mother bonded with her son. The father is currently employed at Ipsco on shift work and is currently living with his parents. The father has had the child since the separation and the child has had little access with his mother. HELD: The child's primary residence should be with the mother. Based on the information before the Court, the mother has always been the primary caregiver of the child and remained at home with the child for the first year of his life. The mother was responsible for the child's day to day needs, health care and child care. As well the father asserts that he was involved in the child's health care needs but was unable to name the child's pediatrician. The father will have access to the child for three days when he is not working including overnight access. The father's gross annual income is $48,897 which results in a payment to the mother for child maintenance in the sum of $393.00 payable on the first day of each and every month until further ordered by the Court. In addition the father will responsible for 75% of the child care expenses.","The parties separated in 1999 and each sought interim custody of their son, born October 10, 1997. The respondent alleged that the respondent was an abusive man with an alcohol problem who was clinically depressed and addicted to alcohol. HELD: 1) The respondent was 31 years of age and employed as unit secretary at the General Hospital. She remained at home with the child for the first year after his birth and then returned to work at the hospital. She had only permitted her to see the child on two occasions for four hours on each occasion. She was concerned for the child's welfare and alleged that she attempted to commit suicide while under the influence of alcohol. 2) S.W.S. was to have access on the three days he was off work each week and the monthly child care costs of $393 were to be paid by the respondent. 3) The Court found that it was in the respondent's best interests to be in C.J.S.'s custody. The child's psychological well-being was at risk and a custodial parent should have access. The Court ordered the respondent to find a primary residence for her and to arrange for maintenance."
5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","Divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less the sum of $15,580.19 that was to be paid to the petitioner in their respective percentage based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra-curricular activities set forth on Exhibits P-9, P-10 and P-ll as well as one half of the maintenance for the children. The court declined to order any spousal support as the petitioner's income was nearly the same and given the fact that after the respondent paid child support (including the extra costs) the income of the respondent and that of the petitioner would be identical. There were no costs awarded to either party and each must pay his or her own costs. HELD: 1)The petitioner was to have judgment against the respondent for the amount remaining unpaid.  2)The respondent's income from his employment as a restaurant waiter was reduced by $400 per month. She also had to pay $40 per month for play school. The costs of the van were to be reduced by another $25,000. 3)The court was satisfied that the respondent stood in loco parentis in respect of the husband. His income from the family farm varied from year to year. It was not appropriate to add any additional value to the matrimonial property. 4)The Court was not satisfied that a mortgage debt of $24,000 was paid off by the petitioner during the marriage which was marginal at best. There was no pre-marriage valuation and no way to determine whether the increase was marginal or at best marginal. The judgment shall be a charge on his personal land."
8_2001nssc179.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","The defendant/plaintiff sought reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses it incurred for equipment rentals and other activities it claimed were required because of the failure of the defendant to perform under the contracted contract. The plaintiff counterclaimed for damages arising out of losses caused by the defendant's unjustified termination of the contract without prior notice. The contractual obligation to'maintain the banks' was to be construed by the wording in the contract, and any variation in wording between the original invitation for tenders and the 1985 invitation for tender is inconsequential. The defendant was required to remove snow from the areas in which coal was being banked and to have the necessary equipment on site. Maintenance of the banks was also an issue. Although the equipment was not the same type and model of equipment as it listed in the response to the tender, no objection was taken with the equipment delivered to the site. The rates for rental were to be paid when equipment was on site and standby rates were applied when equipment wasn't being used. The court found that the rates for the rental were not being used as they should have been. Therefore, the court awarded the contract to the plaintiff, with costs to the defendant and extras for services performed under it, and the defendant was awarded $22.00 per hour for standby time."
8_2010nssc219.txt,"The parties' hostility prevented them from reaching an agreement on interim parenting arrangements for their two-and-a-half-year-old child. There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months). The mother had nothing positive to say about him. They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child. He agreed to abstain from drugs around the child and for 12 hours before access. The mother expressed concern the father was a flight risk because he was from Egypt and had family support outside the country. Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access. The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.","The primary care parent of the child sought supervised access. The father was an abuser of marijuana and had made threats to harm the child and was inattentive to her safety. Both parties had an opportunity to prevent escalation. The mother could have allowed the father to take the jacket and leave, the father could have left without getting into a tug-of-war over the jacket. Both made very bad judgments. The only evidence was that the father was from another country and still had family living in the province. HELD: The court found that the evidence suggested the father had not had contact with the child for some time and that it was unlikely he would be able to obtain an Egyptian passport for the child permanently. The court applied the test in Marshall v. Marshall (1998) and found that: 1) conflict between parents does not necessarily mean joint custody is inappropriate. If there is no reason to change the existing situation, that situation should continue until trial. 2) the father is to attend a course in parenting such as those offered by Family SOS so that he will be informed about child development and understand how to appropriately parent."

The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v.

When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT.

The respondent cross-appealed, claiming the five-month notice period should be reduced due to the appellant's failure to mitigate her loss. The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that the trial judge erred in law by failing to specifically address the arguments that the applicant should have been told the project in question was a 'distinct possibility' and that the offer of employment promised'secretarial and other assistance' that was not the result of any misrepresentations on the part of the defendants. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Supreme Court did not accept the appellant’s submissions that the respondents misrepresented the nature of the employment opportunity. It was unnecessary in these factual circumstances to consider, had misrepresentation been negligently made, whether clause 13 would bar recovery in tort or whether clause 14 would bar the imposition of a five month notice period.  1) The Court of Appeal reviewed the cases and found that pre-contractual representation, which becomes a contractual term, can be found liability in negligent misrepresentations. 2) The evidence showed no palpable and overriding error, indeed, the evidence supported his findings. 3) There was no palpable or overriding error in the trial process.
