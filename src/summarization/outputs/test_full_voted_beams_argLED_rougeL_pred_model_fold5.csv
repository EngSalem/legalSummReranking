"The respondent applied for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings in respect of charges prosecuted against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The applicant had been previously barred from entering the investment dealer's premises. The appeal Division found that the test in American Cyanamid does not apply to this case. The respondent was found guilty of professional misconduct. The trial judge reversed the respondent's decision to enter the action and ordered the respondent to return to the drawing board. The appellant appealed the decision. Allowing the application and holding the hearing in confidence, that the application for an injunction was premature. The court should be reluctant to interfere with the affairs of a domestic tribunal such as the I.D.A. Such an application is premature.","This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet."
"The appellant was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon, a push dagger, contrary to s.89(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge would have to be satisfied that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the push dagger was concealed, that it was a weapon as defined in the Code, and that the appellant intended to use the dagger to cause injury or death to persons.","This was an appeal from a conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, a push dagger, contrary to s.89(a) of the Criminal Code. For the appellant, that the trial judge failed to consider whether the knife fit the definition of a weapon under s.2 of the Criminal Code and, in addition, failed to satisfy himself that the accused intended to use the dagger to cause injury or death or for the purposes of threatening or intimidating. The matter was remitted for a new trial."
"The three respondents were convicted, after their trials, and fined for operating overweight vehicles on the Bedford Highway. The offence with which each was charged was a violation of the Motor Vehicle Act, then s. 172 of the Nova Scotia 1967, and now s. 192 of the Department of Transportation. The trial judge found that although the legal effect of s. 174 (now s. 193) was argued against the respondents, it was not necessary for him to either invoke or rely upon s.174 nor did he in finding each of the respondents guilty of the offence.","The Crown appealed a decision which overturned the respondent's convictions on charges of operating overweight vehicles contrary to s.172 of the Motor Vehicle Act. The Court had overturned the convictions on the ground that the reverse onus provision of s.172, respecting the accuracy of the scale, violated s. 11(d) of the Charter. Allowing the appeal and restoring the convictions, that the trial judge did not rely on the prima facie effect of the Crown's evidence, but rather had ample evidence concerning the accuracy of the scales upon which to rely."
"The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident in February 1988. Liability was not in issue. The trial concerned the level of damages to which the plaintiff was entitled. HELD: The proper level at the time of the accident was $18,000. 1)No evidence was tendered in respect of her loss of housekeeping capacity as it would appear that she was substantially disabled prior to the accident. 2)No weight was given to the expert who was familiar with her pre-accident state than to the physical therapist who was unable to quantify that part of her present disability.","The Plaintiff, aged 72 years, claimed ongoing damages resulting from a whiplash injury suffered in a motor vehicle accident 5 years earlier. She had been involved in previous accidents and also suffered from osteoporosis and hypertension. She displayed some symptoms of mental illness, including paranoid delusions. HELD: The Plaintiff's evidence as to her condition was not accepted. Based upon the opinion of her doctor, the court found partial disability of 3 months, and that her symptoms were fully resolved within 1 year. The court awarded general damages of $18,000.00.  The court refused to award damages for loss of housekeeping capacity, given the Plaintiff's disability prior to the accident."
"The plaintiff corporation was amalgamated with the defendant corporation and held itself out as an energy efficiency consultant. The defendant entered into a letter agreement whereby the defendant agreed to pay half of the plaintiff's energy savings, as well as a declaration that the Letter Arrangement did not constitute an enforceable contract; third, if it did, that the plaintiff was not liable under the contract to the defendant, and fourth, if the plaintiff is liable, then only to the extent of liability determined by the court. The plaintiff brought an application to set aside the default judgment on the basis of forum non conveniens. In this action, the defendant argued that it had no legitimate excuse for failing to file a defence. Dismissing the application, that there was no evidentiary basis to support the defendant's argument that the deliberate decision not to attune to the jurisdiction of the Nova Scotia courts should not be regarded as a reasonable excuse for not filing a defence in this case.","The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse."
"FIAT. The defendant was in contempt of court orders requiring him to account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. A trustee was appointed, and the files of Bawolin were seized. Then an accountant prepared a forensic audit. HELD: 1)The Court ordered the defendant to pay the solicitor/client costs taxed. Even if Siemens was substantially unsuccessful at trial in her allegations of wrongdoing by Bawol, still he ought to pay these costs because he caused the expense of the pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. 2)This was the more appropriate route in the circumstances. When all the evidence was in, it may transpire that Siemens is in fact, indebted to Bawoline as he now says, at the time of the contempt. 3)The judge ordered the liability to be taxed.","FIAT. The defendant had been held in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. The issue here was responsibility for the legal costs incurred by the plaintiff to compel production. Her solicitor/client bill exceeded $50,000 including very large disbursements as a trustee was appointed to preserve the property and the defendant solicitor's files were seized. An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention. Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.  1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared. Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties. 2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge. It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs. It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected."
The plaintiff alleged negligence by the two defendants medical doctors and claims damages arising from the negligence of the doctors. HELD: The plaintiff's case was dismissed with costs. 1)The medical examiners did not meet the standard of care required of them in their treatment of the plaintiff. The doctor's opinion was based upon the knowledge that the plaintiff was impaled on an iron fence for approximately 25 minutes and that the injury was a 'through and through' wound. 2)The primary issue was whether the defendants were negligent in the manner in which they dealt with the plaintiff's injury. 3)The plaintiff did not reveal any of the possible signs of soft tissue damage or infection. The pain and suffering he suffered was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants but rather the acts of the defendants contributed to the damage.,"The plaintiff's leg was impaled for 25 minutes on an iron fence which he had attempted to climb for. He was treated at the emergency department of the Victoria General Hospital for an hour. He did not inform the doctors as to the length of time he had been impaled. Upon his release he was advised to watch for any infection. He was not issued antibiotics. The wound quickly worsened, and the plaintiff was forced to undergo surgery and a skin graft to repair his leg. He sued the doctors who initially treated him for negligence. Dismissing the action, that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way. While the defendants underestimated the nature and extent of the injury, they provided a recognized method of treatment based upon the knowledge they had. The real fault lies with the plaintiff who failed to reveal fully what had happened to him."
"The accused was convicted of robbery. He was sentenced to two years in federal penitentiary followed by two years of probation. The four other young men who joined the attack on the accused were also sentenced to probation. In this sentence, the court found that the accused had a high risk of repeat robbery and that he would benefit from supervision following his release. The court also imposed conditions on his probation. Amongst many aggravating features of the offence, the accused was found to be at a crossroads. He had some talent and some motivation to become a productive member of society.","The offender was convicted of robbery. He and four other young men attacked and violently robbed a university student of jewellery and other valuables worth more than $7,000. Despite poor upbringing, abuse at the hands of his stepmother, and being moved from many foster homes, the offender had completed high school and one year of university. There was a favourable pre-sentence report suggesting good prospects for rehabilitation, and a joint sentence recommendation for two years' imprisonment followed by two years probation with strict terms, including 180 hours of community service. Accepting the joint sentence recommendation, that the offender is at a crossroads, and has the talent and motivation to become reintegrated into society as a productive member of the community, and who will benefit from a shorter term of imprisonment than is usual for this type of offence, combined with post incarceration supervision."
"FIAT. The applicants sought an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development in close proximity to the Evergreen Centre and from giving third reading to and adopting a Bylaw 756/99. HELD: 1) The applicants failed to meet the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting.  2) The applicant did not demonstrate bad faith. The issues were: (a) was the respondent's proceedings in respect to the proposed hotel invalid by reason of bad faith; (b) Has the respondent met the statutory postrequisites for such a meeting; and (c) had the respondent complied with its obligations under the bylaw. 3) The respondents had not taken appropriate steps to bring the proposal to fruition. In each instance the fact of the 'in camera' meeting was recorded and the Council's consequent action was made part of the public record. In the circumstances, reject the suggestion that there were any improper understandings.","In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent. The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings. The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400."
"The accused were convicted of using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. The accused appealed their conviction on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law in holding that the appellants as Metis (Indians) within the meaning of the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement (NRTA) did not have an Aboriginal right to hunt at night with searchlight. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate aboriginal peoples' right (s.11.1) and the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity. The focus has shifted to the limiting legislation in both Aboriginal and Treaty hunting rights. The appellants have failed to show any error in law by applying the justification test pursuant to Sparrow.  2)Solemn and historical Aboriginal rights protected by s.7 and s.8 of the Constitution Act, 1867, were clearly subject to federal and provincial legislation if the legislation does not constitute prima facie infringement of those rights. 3)The objective was primarally safety, both from the words used in the legislation and the evidence introduced. There was no infringement of aboriginal rights arising from the legislation. The question was whether the legislation had an avalid objective? Is the honour of the Crown at stake in dealing with the Aboriginal peoples? Has there been as little infringement as possible? 4)Had the Aboriginal group been consulted? The answer was yes. The trial judge applied the Sparrow test of infringement and justification to the issue. The issue was whether s.11.(3) infringed the accused's aboriginal right and if so, whether it was justifiable.  5)The court was unable to accept that the appellant's argument that night hunting with artificial lights was not part of any aboriginal hunting right, and even if it was, it was justified because of the strong safety factor. 6)The appellants were not subject to the restrictions imposed by the Regulations. They enjoyed aboriginal hunting rights independent of s.35(1). The regulations did not affect their Aboriginal right.  7)The appeal was also dismissed on the ground of an error in assessment of the facts.","An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis."
"The respondent sought an order prohibiting the petitioner from removing the child from the province of Saskatchewan until she obtains a Court order allowing her to do so. The petitioner and her new common law wife had been discussing for some time how best to deal with the child's needs. In the last year, the child has been experiencing problems at home and at school, the petitioner took the child to Dr. Verma in Swift Current who prescribed Ritalin, suspecting that the child suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. The doctor in Saskatoon was not aware of the pending move. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. Nothing in the judgment referred to above requires the petitioner to obtain such an order. It only provides that the respondent receive 90 days' written notice. The respondent was informed verbally of the proposed move in September or early October.","The respondent seeks an order prohibiting the petitioner from removing her son from Saskatchewan until she obtains a Court order allowing her to do so. The child is the petitioner's son from a prior relationship. The petitioner plans to have the child live with his biological father in Edmonton so that he can get the specialized medical care that he requires. When the petitioner and the respondent separated, they consented to a judgment, which granted the petitioner custody of the child and gave access rights to the respondent. The consent judgment provided that the petitioner was to provide the respondent with 90 days notice of any proposed change in the child's residence. Notice of the upcoming move was provided to the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. The consent judgment does not require the petitioner to get an order before changing the child's residence. An application will be required by the petitioner to vary the access arrangements with the respondent."
"The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules striking paragraphs 10, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 from the applicant's amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the statement of claims to remain would be an abuse of process. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal proceeding is inadmissible in a subsequent civil proceeding as proof that the party did not commit the offence. 2) The plaintiff bears the liability on the balance of probabilities of proving self-defence beyond a reasonable doubt. 3) In the criminal proceedings brought by the crown against the plaintiff, Mr. Windrem does not have control of the proceedings. As in all criminal cases, he was simply witness and was required to answer the questions of crown counsel in direct examination and to respond to the questions posed to him in cross-examination. He did not have the control over the proceeding in any event of the cause.","The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules striking paragraphs of the amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the statement of claim to remain would be an abuse of process. The paragraphs of the amended statement of claim at issue deal with the fact that the plaintiff alleges he was assaulted by the defendant and sustained bodily harm. The defendant was charged with assault, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. The issue is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceedings on the subsequent civil proceedings. HELD: The paragraphs of the statement of claim at issue do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial is inadmissible in a subsequent civil trial as proof that the party did not commit the offence.  2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the Crown against the defendant, the Crown bore the onus throughout to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence did not apply and the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings. In the civil proceeding, the plaintiff is in a position to control the presentation of his case and must prove his case on a balance of probabilities. The onus of proving self-defence is on the defendant. He bears the onus of proving the assault was justified and was made with reasonable force."
"The appellant sought a declaration to strike the appellant's claim under s. 36 of the Constitution Act. The chambers judge struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. The appellant appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the court found that, in the context of this appeal, the claim should be struck only if they appear to be absolutely unsustainable or certain to fail; the proposed interpretation offered by the appellant was simply too vague. The court found: 1)The appellant had failed to demonstrate a justiciable commitment on the part of the federal government and the provinces; and 2)It was clear the motion to strike was not taken lightly. The Chambers judge did not answer the question of whether or not Apotex's proposed interpretation was 'worth considering' or whether it had a chance of success; nor did the Attorney General reach her own conclusion on the disputed point of statutory interpretation. That is an error on her part.","The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it."
The applicant sought an order in the nature of mandamus to compel the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was disabled and had been recipient of income assistance from the Department of Community Services since 2006. His assistance was terminated in May 2006 due to failure to disclose requested information. He re-applied for income assistance in May 2007. His application was again denied based on failure to provide requested information and he appealed the decision of the Appeal Board in September 2007. The Board ordered that his assistance be effective the date he was assessed. The Applicant sought further information from the applicant. The respondent refused to comply and the applicant was denied the appeal. The application for an order under the nature prescribed mandamus was granted. The court found that there was a clear legal right established to have the decisionof the Appeal board enforced. There must be a duty to the applicant by the parties seeking to be coerced to do the act requested and a duty owed must not be discretionary nature but may be established either at common law or statute. The Court granted the application for the application in the form of mandamamus compelling the respondent implement the Appeal's decision retroactive to June 2007.,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision."
"The accused was charged with fishing without a licence contrary to s. 11(1) of the Fisheries Regulations (Saskatchewan), and with operating a fishing licence while disqualified or prohibited contrary to section 13 of the Act (Canada). At the close of the Crown's Charter application, defence brought a Charter application challenging the constitutionality of s. 35 of The Fisheries Act, 1994. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of the act. Counts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were dismissed.","The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations. The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch. The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one. The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations. The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door. The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts. It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue."
"The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Court granted leave and allowed the appeal in part. The accused was found guilty of assault contrary to ss. 267(1)(a) of the Code. A Provincial Court judge found him guilty of the offence and granted him a conditional discharge with a probation period of 9 months. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, judge of that Court quashed his conviction and ordered a new trial. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge was correct in his reasons. While the accused's mistake of fact was reasonable, he would not have rejected the defence of self-defence on the basis that the use of pepper spray was not proportionate to his response, the Court found that the officer in question was not the same person who had been afraid and had not been listening to what the accused was saying. The trial judge did not direct himself to all of the relevant evidence and in particular focused on the fact there were two officers present.","The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others."
"The parties were married in 1986 and separated in 1995. The primary issue between the parties is custody of their four children. Ancillary to and dependent upon the determination of the custody issue, is the quantum of child support that will be payable by either party. Matrimonial property owned by the parties at the time of separation has largely been divided between them to their mutual satisfaction. However, in making an order for custody pursuant to the Divorce Act, the court must take into consideration only the best interests of the children as determined by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of those children. HELD: The children were in the joint custody of the parties and they resided an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. 1) The uncontradicted evidence indicated that the most important consideration for these children is stability. That stability is found in their father's home. The children are bonded to their mother. 2) There was no evidence of the increased costs of shared custody such that consideration could be given to s. 9(b) of the Guidelines. It is in their best interests that they be removed from an environment that offers them the stability that they require nor from the specialized educational opportunities available to them in Saskatoon.","The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support. Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs."
"FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage, born May 1993. The parties agreed that the husband would have interim sole custody. By an agreement dated November 1997 the wife was diagnosed as suffering from unipolar/clinical depression and had just been discharged from hospital. She had just undergone treatment for depression. She was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization as the respondent was employed as a long-distance truck driver. After the agreement was entered into, the respondent changed jobs and now lived in Saskatoon. His sister babysits the child during the week while he was at work and the applicant was of the opinion the more loving and caring parent. Both children attended kindergarten each morning and were with the respondent's sister each afternoon. HELD: The application was dismissed. It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody arrangements pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. The consistent case law indicates that once an interim custody arrangement has been in place for some time, whether de facto, by court order, or by agreement of the parties, the non-primary care parent should not apply on an interim basis to vary the arrangement (except where risk of a child exists), but proceed to a final order.  1) The applicant has filed a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health is stable at this point in time and supporting her view that she can care for the child over extended periods of time. 2) There is no evidence before the court that the children are at risk if they stay with the mother. Every day is a new day for the applicant. Every weekend is a risk of the applicant having to re-enter the hospital for psychiatric treatment. Every other weekend is an opportunity to assess the parties giving their evidence and being cross-examined. 3) The alternative variation in the access she has to the applicant is based on what the motions judge ordered in 1999.","FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage,and in the alternative a variation in access. The father counter applied for interim custody. The parties agreed in 1997 that the father should have interim custody. The mother argued that she was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization for unipolar/clinical depression. The father had been employed as a long distance trucker but now worked days in the city. HELD: The applications for custody were dismissed. Overnight access was granted to the mother. 1)The application ignored the consistent law which states the courts should not vary interim custody arrangements whether legal or de facto in the absence of evidence that the child(ren) are in some way at risk, or other compelling reason. It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. The non-primary care parent should proceed to final order which in this provicne means obtaining a pre-trial date for a pre-trial conference and proceed to trial if custody is not resolved at that stage. 2)The court was satisfied on the basis of a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health was stable that the child was not at risk if the mother were granted overnight access."
"The wife was left in poverty by the departure of the breadwinner in whose name most of the family assets were habitually held. In many cases she was left with nowhere to live. The husband owned some assets but his share was only $2,000 as he was quick to claim exemption for his own house, which they never lived in, and all of the assets which he had before the marriage. HELD: The husband was awarded judgment for $1,945 plus an award of $5,000 for a total of $6,900. 1)The matrimonial home was owned by the wife prior to the 21 month marriage between the parties and her 10 children all born of a previous marriage. These two items were subject to income tax so a 30% deduction was applied to their value leaving a $7,690 value. To that number must be added the accrual to a Sun Life policy during the same period of $2200 for $8,890. 2)The wife assumed debts of $3,000. She had obtained a grade 12 equivalency; she held down two jobs; one as noon supervisor in the school system and one as office cleaner at night. Both had the benefit of the matrimony home during the marriage and both had the prospect of an inheritance from her mother, a good pension, and in short no financial problems.  3)It was in its entirety inequitable and had he not filed a counter petition there would have been no division, no trial and no excessive legal costs because the petition made no property claims whatever.  4)The husband had to assume a large mortgage or move out of their modest $60,000 home or to rental accommodation. The wife's house, jointly owned with his mother as protection 'in case he meets someone' is exempt property.","Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property."
"Landowner appealed an assessment for taxation purposes to the Board of Revision of the City of Regina (the 'Board') alleging it to be too high. No cross-appeal was filed by the City, but the Board increased the assessment. The City appealed to the Saskatchewan Municipal Board Assessment Appeals Committee (the ""Committee"") to ask for a further increase. There was no cross-Appeal by the owner. The Assessment Appeals committee concluded that the Board had erred, having no jurisdiction as the matter had unfolded, to make an increase, and it restored the original value. [3 Leave to appeal was granted on the facts of the case and the Committee was correct in concluding that the board had no jurisdiction to make the order which it did. It then, as an appellate entity, was asked to affirm what was, in essence, a nullity. This it could not do. The appeal of the city, in its essence, was dismissed. The respondent taxpayer had its costs in the ususal way on double Column V.","The landowner appealed an assessment for taxation purposes to the City Board of Revision alleging it was too high.

There was no-cross appeal by the owner. The Committee concluded the Board erred, having no jurisdiction to make an increase, and restored the original value. Leave to appeal was granted with respect to whether the Committee erred in making an order respecting issues not raised by the notice of intention to appeal; in ruling the assessed value cannot be increased where the board orders correction of errors in the assessment; if not, whether the Committee erred in jurisdiction in failing to apply s.263.2 of the Urban Municipality Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double column V to the respondent. The Committee was correct in concluding the Board had no jurisdiction to make the order. It was asked to affirm what was in essence a nullity."
"The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D&S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence. It is alleged that the defendant failed to perform as agreed and in consequence the plaintiff seeks damages. The defendant resists the claim and by way of a counterclaim seeks judgment for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs to the defendant to be set at $4,000. The plaintiff was awarded the sum of $41,007.83. 1) The Court was satisfied that there was a discussion about round pillars and it was intended that they would be a part of the contract. However, there was an excessive number of changes and he was not required to pay for the extras. This was only an issue because the defendant did not provide invoices to substantiate the cost of extras. 2) Costs of performance were to be valued on the basis of cost of performance (of bringing the system up to the standard originally intended) and not in the diminution in value of the building. 3) Although the plaintiff was in Phoenix only once, he was struck by two things that were part of a Phoenix house: the pillars and the roof. It does not seem likely he would then speak with his contractor about only the one and only the roof, but it makes sense that he would speak to him about both the pillar and roof before speaking with Mr. Wist. That is the only thing that can be said to be the cause of the delay. The Court concluded that it was attributable to both parties equally.  4) Amount of interest was dismissed against the plaintiff's claim against the defendant of $764.62.","The plaintiff claimed damages for failure to perform as agreed in constructing a residence. Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower. The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to."
"The lease between the landlord and the tenant contained an arbitration clause. The tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to that clause quashed. The lease was amended and then assigned to Loblaws. The dispute arose between the Landlord and Tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. dispute also arose about insurance coverage and whether insurance should be applied. The arbitrator found the tenant liable in the sum of $318,252 for repairs and $59,130.34 for loss of rental opportunity. The landlord sought to quash the award. HELD: 1)The arbitrator was not limited to interpreting the clauses of the lease. He could deal with the issue of insurance coverage. He did not have jurisdiction to award damages. The principles of waiver and estoppel applied as against the tenant. 2)The arbitration clause under the lease was a limited arbitration clause which did not provide that all disputes between the parties were to be settled by arbitration, but only disputes with regard to clauses or provisions of the leases. There was no jurisdiction to resolve the claim such as this which arises from the Landowner/Tenant relationship itself and not the clauses and provisions of a lease. 3)The issues of responsibility for repairs, whether the loss was covered by insurance and whether notification or claim was required were issues within the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator. The parties did not agree that the loss should be covered by the insurance policy. 4)The Arbitrator was entitled to award costs.","A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable."
"The wife brought an application pursuant to Rule 14.25 to strike out the husband's application for retroactive child support. She sought a variation in relation to spousal support and a retroactive order, both designed to cover Melissa's past educational costs. The husband opposed the application and sought consolidation so that one hearing could be held. The wife was estranged from her father and denied any obligation for the outstanding balance. The father was entitled to costs.Application dismissed; the husband had complied with his child support obligation as set out in the corollary relief judgment and there was nothing to enforce. The only change in circumstances since the application was that the wife now sought declaratory relief, exemplary or punitive damages and costs. There had not been a prior guideline order.","The husband applied to have the wife's application for retroactive child support to cover the costs of the child's post-secondary education struck as a matter more properly addressed as an issue of contract. In addition to the child support ordered in the Corollary Relief Judgment, the husband had signed a document in which he agreed to repay the costs of the daughter's American student loans (which had to be obtained in the wife's name as the wife was an American). The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation. Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'. There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties."
"FIAT. By fiat of December 5, 2002, Gerein C.J. authorized the initiation of a derivative action by Dale Henry on behalf of 609. By May 27, 2004, I ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine a representative of 607 for discovery and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for the action. HELD: It was the plaintiff and the defendants who have status in these proceedings and not Henry in his personal capacity nor the board of directors of 6X.","FIAT: By fiat of December 5, 2002, Gerein C.J. authorized the initiation of a derivative action by Dale Henry (Henry) on behalf of 609897 Saskatchewan Ltd. (609). By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action. In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs. Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609."
"The respondent, resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and was sentenced to nine months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The offence took place in Yorkton. The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck, finding the respondent was low risk to reoffend and of no real danger to society. The father was depressed and remorseful. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part (orally). It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range but in these circumstances there is no basis for interfering with the sentence imposed. A more significant issue is the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeitures of the vehicle used to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The truck had value of approximately $20,000. It was owned by the respondent and paid for through a loan from his parents. The trial judge found that 'basically all of the money to pay for the truck came from the parents' bank account to the kid to pay the truck. He found that the truck was integral in the operation of transporting the respondent to various places across the country. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent was convicted of having in his possession a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and was sentenced to a term of incarceration of 9 months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property."
"The parties were previously before the Court in an action for custody, access, support, divorce and division of family property. Due to change in circumstances, it was necessary to sever of the matters of custody and access and support. This judgment deals with divorce and Divorce. The petitioner inherited the family home from his father prior to the commencement of the spousal relationship. The respondent is not making any claim against the property. Accordingly this parcel is not included in the family property to be distributed.HELD: The Court fixed July 2005 as the application date. For distribution purposes, the Court fixed that value at $94,621.77. The value for distribution was reduced to $6,500 based on the difference in value between the two dates.","This judgment dealt with divorce and division of family property. At issue was the value of the matrimonial home and the balance of family property. HELD: Decree of divorce issued. Valuations of the family home and property were made, and exemptions and equitable considerations were addressed. Equalization payments were prescribed. As the results of the action were mixed, no costs were ordered."
"The Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) upheld the appellant's claim for gradual onset stress. The appellant argued that the policy was wrong to exclude certain workplace events and stressors from an objective point of view. The appeal turned on one main issue: whether the policy should be applied to the decisions relating to the worker's gradual onset trauma claim. The issue was whether the Policy applied too restrictive a test. The respondent appealed. Appeal dismissed; WCAT did not err in not giving weight to the opinion of the Workers’ Compensation Board’s treating psychologist; nor was it wrong to rely on the respondent’ s. 4(1)(a)(i) policy in determining the nature of the workplace stressors. The only conclusion drawn was that there were no unusual and excessive stressors in the workplace. The policy set out the conditions under which each type of stress is compensable under GECA; the policy did not require an objective approach to the workplace; and, in the absence of such an approach, the Court could not find that the Policy was fundamentally restrictive.","The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation."
"The Landlord and Tenant appealed an order of the Director allowing the Tenant $787.50 against the Landlord as compensation for what the Director found to be a breach of the statutory condition to provide premises suitable for habitation. The Landlord had allowed mould to develop in her basement, which was damp and riddled with mould. She also produced evidence of medical letters to the effect that her children suffered from asthma and ought not to be exposed to mould. The Tenant testified that there simply was no mould. Her position was that the landlord used grey spray paint to resemble mould. When the mould first began to develop the Tenants called the Halifax Regional Municipality office, which sent a letter to the police inspector stating that he had observed mouldy conditions in the basement. He recommended a dehumidifier be placed in basement. Tenant moved out. Landlord's response was notice to vacate, with the result that the Tenante moved out and brought this application for compensation. Photographs of the mould caused by the landlords were placed in evidence. The condition of the premises was so poor that it was impossible to believe that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away it. The Director's findings were also disbelieved. The damages were much higher than the $862.50 awarded to the landlord on the basis that the furniture, area rug and clothing were ruined, and because of the lack of evidence of the other items, the plaintiff's damages were at a much higher amount.","The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined. The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it."
"The defendant pleaded guilty to an offence under the Occupational Health and Safety Act for failing to take every precaution that is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons at the workplace. The guilty plea relates to the fact that there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. The defendant's failure was in not securing the manure pit which had its damaged barricade removed while a new one was on order, or not arranging for an alternative to using the pit, alternatives that did exist at the time.  The defendant had no prior record for safety issues under the Act. He had made substantial changes to his farm since the tragedy of the dairyman's death and had taken steps to improve safety at the farm. The Court accepted the submission that a $25,000 penalty is a significant penalty for the defendant and recognized that it should include a significant contribution to farm safety initiatives.","The defendant farmer pled guilty to failing to take every precaution that was reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons in the workplace, after a young employee drowned in a manure pit that was not properly secured due to a damaged barricade having been removed while a new one was on order. Defendant sentenced to fine of $25,000, from which the sum of $15,000 shall be paid to the Canadian Farmers' Disability Registry; defendant ordered to perform 160 hours of community service with respect to farm safety. The defendant was an individual and not a huge corporation, had been conscientious about safety issues prior to this incident and had endeavored to improve safety at his farm after the incident; the deceased had also failed in his responsibilities under the Act and was working with a significant blood alcohol content."
The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of impaired driving. The Crown claims the trial judge erred in law in excluding two breath samples taken after the arrest of the accused on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge did not fail to fulfil the objective grounds for the demand. The Court must consider the subjective and objective factors beyond a reasonable doubt. 2) The evidence from the officer and the breathalyzer technician on the scene was sufficient to enable the Crown to establish that the accused was impaired by alcohol. The breath samples were of reasonable and probable grounds as determined by the officer based on the observations of the officer. The officer was of the opinion that he was showing signs of impairment and she consciously determined that she would not do an approved roadside screening device demand on him. She stated she would make an ASD demand if she suspected a driver had been consuming alcohol. 3) The accused was cooperative and did not object to the breath samples being taken. He did not display any symptoms of impairment other than being confused.,"The Crown appealed the respondent's acquittal on a charge of driving over .08. The Crown alleged that the trial judge erred in law by excluding two breath samples taken following the respondent's arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter of Rights. During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence. HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered. The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter. The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted as a full exhibit and became part of the Crown's case. The Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt in all respects."
"Pellicer v. Williams, 2012 NSSC 267 (CanLII) The parties litigated the apportionment of custody and access rights and the quantification of child support and special expenses for their two children. The respondent did not persuade the Court to reduce his child support obligation. The matter required court time on two days and additional chambers time when the Court was required to resolve disagreements between the parties. On the important parenting issue, the evidence established that the respondent was the appropriate primary care parent. The appellant's initiative in seeking to vary the existing order was not reasonable and responsible. Income was imputed to the respondent by the Court. The Court imputed an income level to the appellant that Ms. Pellicer was prepared to accept prior to the commencement of the hearing ($25,000). Costs of $3,000 are assessed against the respondent. This is a costs decision. The parties' case law, L.N.D. v. L. (M.S.), 2010 NSSCP 159 and 2012 SSSC 423 have been litigated. The issues are complex and the need for the court to exercise its discretion and to move away from strict application of the Tariffs is often present. In this costs decision, the Court found failure to timely disclose on the part of the petitioner and assessed the relative'success' of the parties and the presence or absence of offers to settle.","Rule 77.01 – Scope of Rule 77 This is a costs decision following litigation between the mother and father regarding apportionment of custody and access rights, quantification of child support and special expenses for the parties' children. The mother was the successful party and income was imputed by the court to the respondent.  Held, costs in the amount of $3,000 are awarded against the father. The father's position caused unnecessary time, effort and delay. The court referenced L. (N.D.) v. L. (M.S.) (2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77. Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs."
"This was an appeal from a conviction of first degree murder. The trial judge's instructions to the jury contained several serious errors, the most serious being the instruction as to the requisite intent for murder. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that nothing short of the accused's subjective foresight of death can found a conviction for murder by the application of s. 231(5) of the Criminal Code. In addition, the instructions on the defence of drunkenness were not adequate and there were errors in the jury selection process.","This was an appeal from a first degree murder conviction. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge erred in (1) failing to instruct the jury that nothing short of the accused's subjective foresight of death could found a conviction; (2) instructing the jury they could return a first degree murder conviction on the basis of s.231(5) of the Criminal Code; and (3) failing to give adequate instructions on the defence of drunkenness. The court also found errors in the jury selection process."
"The young offender who was convicted of nine charges of break and enter and one charge of assault claimed that the statements taken from him by the Youth Court Police were voluntary. He appealed the conviction on the basis that the impugned statements were voluntary, and sought a new trial. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge erred in law in concluding that the statement taken at 17:11 hours and 19:50 hours were voluntary statements. The failure by the trial court to make any findings with respect to this issue was a palpable and overriding error.","This was an appeal by a young offender who was convicted of nine charges of break and enter and one charge of assault. He argued the youth court judge erred in concluding statements made to the police were made voluntarily. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that both the appellant's sister and girlfriend gave evidence of inducements by the police to the accused to admit to the alleged crimes, in return for a lighter sentence. The trial judge failed to address this evidence, thereby committing a palpable and overriding error."
"This was an appeal from a decision of a Family Court judge declining to rescind an order in 1993 for permanent care and custody of the appellant's granddaughter. The basis on which the application was made was that the appellant consented to or agreed with the 1993 order on the faith of the agency's then plan of care. Unfortunately, the adoption plans did not materialize because the mother had a drug dependency problem. The husband reported the problem to the Agency, which it sought its intervention because he alone could not care for the child. The appellant sought rescission on the authority of the Family Court Rule 15:07 and 15:08. The procedure adopted by the appellant was an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of the past circumstances of the child rather than an assessment of her present circumstances. The appeal was dismissed without costs.","This was an appeal from a Family Court decision declining to rescind an order for the permanent care and custody of the appellant's granddaughter. She relied upon Civil Procedure Rules 15.07 and 15.08. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's application was an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of past circumstances of the child rather than an assessment of her current circumstances. The proper remedy would be for the applicant to apply for a termination of the order under s. 48 of the Children and Family Services Act."
"The wife/petitioner sought maintenance for herself from her husband. HELD: 1)Ron was to pay a lump sum of $18,000.00 which was to be made on or before June 30, 1998. 2)There would be judgment for a divorce in January 1998 but it would not be issued until after January 1998. 3)The interim maintenance order would terminate with the payment for December 1997. 4)The lump sum was free from income tax.","The petitioner sought spousal maintenance. The parties, now 56 and 61, were married in 1961 and separated in 1994. The wife had part of Grade 9 and the parties had agreed she would stay home and raise the four children. HELD: 1)Judgment for divorce was to be issued in the usual form after January 1/98. 2)The respondent was to pay as maintenance a lump sum of $18,000 free from any income tax. The interim maintenance order was to terminate with payment for December 1997. The wife could find employment but at a rate at or near minimum wage. She had no motivation to work, having convinced herself that there was no work available and that her health did not permit it. The wife would benefit from having bridge income until she attained age 60 in 2001. Her half of the matrimonial property included a share of a superannuation program.  3)The respondent was to pay $1,000 as costs to the petitioner."
"The applicant sought approval of the Court for a settlement on behalf of the infant plaintiff. The issue before the Court was the amount of a Contingency Fee Agreement which the respondent had registered with the Prothonotary's Office as required. HELD: The Court agreed the $17,000 was a reasonable settlement on the facts of the case. The settlement proposed for approval was the sum agreed to be paid in full. Counsel were instructed to present to the Court an appropriate bond. This bond was approved.","The applicant sought approval of the Court for a settlement reached on behalf of the infant plaintiff, who had been injured in an automobile accident. Part of the order sought provided for the payment of solicitor fees by way of a contingency fee agreement negotiated with the applicant. The contingency fee agreement was never filed with the prothonotary. Granting the order relating to the settlement amount, but setting aside the contingency fee agreement, that Civil Procedure Rule 63.19(1) requires that all contingency fee agreements be filed with the prothonotary. As this was not done, the applicant's solicitor is only entitled to compensation as would have been payable in the absence of the contingency agreement."
"The only witness called at trial was the plaintiff. The action was brought against the defendant, Hyndman, with respect to amounts owing for payments on vehicles leased by the defendant from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to these leased vehicles. The defendant did not appear at trial nor did it enter defence to the allegations contained in the statement of claim. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed.  1)It did not satisfy me on a balance of probabilities that this was an appropriate circumstance for an award in favour of the plaintiff based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.  2)The actions taken by both the defendant and the plaintiff in an attempt to keep it operational were taken for the benefit of the company. As it turned out, neither the plaintiff nor the defendant benefited from this arrangement for very long and both lost money.  3)The plaintiff's evidence did not establish that the defendant had notice of the invoices, or that there was a purchase order number obtained from the defendant. In fact the evidence indicates that the plaintiff gave notice to the plaintiff, Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchasing order number once they realized there may have been a misapprehension by Standard's creditors with regard to the payment of these accounts. 4)The defendant was awarded taxable costs of the claim.","An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number."
"The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of the defendant's cattle getting into the plaintiff's canola field in late July, 1999. The defendant admitted that his cattle were in the plaintiff’s crop on one occasion but said that there was no evidence they were in any other location during the time. The plaintiff also denied liability under s.27 of the Stray Animals Act. HELD: Judgment was granted in favour of the plaintiffs. The cattle owner was strictly liable for damage caused by his cattle. The court accepted the evidence of a professional witness who had examined the field extensively and who was entitled to assess dockage at the elevator. However, the court found that the expert was not prohibited from going throughout the field. The damage was minimal and the plaintiff was not disbarred.","The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions."
The parties agreed that the respondent was no longer residing in the trailer court and that they would share joint custody. The decision was appealed and the Court of Appeal delivered the following judgment: The trial judge remitted the matter back to the trial judge. There may have been numerous changes of circumstances which go far beyond the single issue which the Court OF Appeal directed be returned to the Court. HELD: The application to vary was to proceed by way of an application to apply to vary and the issue raised by the decision of the Court Of Appeal will be subsumed in that application.  1)The Court of appeal directed that the application to allow the matter to proceed should not be taken on by the parties. 2)The court confirmed that it would not be served upon the respondent to challenge the legislation dealing with custody and access.,"The Court of Appeal remitted the issue of custody to the trial judge on April 13, 2000 but the matter was adjourned for various reasons. The parties had brought numerous applications since the July 9, 1999 decision and they had been in a pre-trial. HELD: An application was to be brought which would encompass all of the new issues. There had been numerous changes in circumstances which went beyond the single issue referred back. The petitioner intends to challenge the legislation dealing with custody and access but was unaware he is required to serve notice under the Constitutional Questions Act."
"The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendants from breaching the terms of its restrictive covenants by taking employment with Brennan. The applicant had previously sought an injunction restraining its employees from soliciting, contacting, making use of confidential information and from providing service to any customers of the applicant. The respondent had refused to provide written notice to the employees and the employees had undertaken other forms of voluntary voluntary resignations. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The applicant failed to demonstrate a prima facie case or even a serious issue to be tried that it was in law entitled to more than two weeks notice or that the respondents were in breach of any right which accrued to the applicant; 2)The injunctive relief sought was limited to the period immediately following the termination of the employment agreement. The court found that the applicant had not established a primacy case or a serious issues to be had in view of the numerous breaches it had already suffered. The application for an injunction was also dismissed.  3)The respondent was found to have breached its duty to protect its employees and suppliers by recruiting them and then soliciting them for its promotional activities. The respondents were found to be in breach as well. 4)The application for injunctions was dismissed.","The plaintiff employer sought injunctive relief and sought to enforce certain restrictive covenants and to restrain employees from competitive activity pending the expiration of reasonable notice periods and generally restrain all respondents from any dealings with customers of the plaintiff or pertaining to equipment sold or leased to customers by the plaintiff. HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired. The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients. 3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice. 4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants. The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods. 5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff."
"The appellant, who is mentally handicapped, appeals the entrusting of custody of her five year old son to the respondents. The child was born in 1989 and in the home of the appellant and her child, the respondent. The Child and His Mother were placed with the appellant's and the respondent's (M.H.) parents. The relationship between the appellant, the mother and the child broke down and she left the care of the respondents on May 30, 1992. The appellant appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge erred in finding the respondent had sufficient interest within the meaning of s.6(1) of the Children's Law Act and therefore status to apply for custody. 2)The respondent's testimony was accepted by the trial judge as being consistent with the findings of various experts. 3)The court was not persuaded by the evidence of the trial tribunal that the findings were not consistent with all of the expert's findings. The trial judge was not seeking to overturn the findings by the tribunal but was persuaded by various expert's.","The Respondents contracted with the Department to care for a child and his Mother who was mentally disabled. After two years, the relationship between the Respondents and the Mother broke down and she left their home. The Respondents sought and were granted custody of the child. The Mother appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Respondents had sufficient interest under s.6 of The Children's Law Act to seek custody of the child. 2)The trial judge correctly determined that the only issue was the child's best interests, even in a contest between a parent and a stranger, although the parent/child relationship was one factor to be considered. 3)The findings of the trial judge were strongly supported by the evidence, the law was correctly applied, and therefore his decision ought not be overturned. 4)The matter was returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access."
"The parties separated in June 1992 and the petitioner voluntarily left the matrimonial home in November 1992. There has been a marriage breakdown and the divorce is granted. The Matrimonial Property Act and Corollary Relief orders have been issued for the benefit of the parties. The petitioner seeks equal parental control and responsibility by an order for joint custody under s.16(4) of the Divorce Act. The parties have been married for 14 years and have two children, a son and a daughter. The respondent seeks to be the final decision maker in matters relating to the children's welfare, growth and development while in their father's custody. The Court reviewed the access provisions submitted for consideration at hearing the respondent. The issues before the court were resolved by mutual agreement. HELD: 1)The children's investment totems in the approximate amount of $2,000 were found to yield an appropriate return. 2)The respondent was to have sole responsibility and decision making authority for the day-to-day physical care and control of the children and the father's specific access.  3)The Court found that the present joint custody arrangement was not working well for the children. The children had access to the respondent who was able to schedule their day activities around the children, while the petitioner was restricted to access with the father on the weekends.","This was a petition for divorce with an application for settlement of corollary matters, especially custody and access. The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions. The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue. The mother sought sole custody with generous access. The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication. Allowing the mother's application, that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say. Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues. As the parties lacked flexibility, a detailed access plan was incorporated."
"The matrimonial property was settled by the parties in 1985. A consent order giving effect to the vesting order provided that the university would receive a vested interest in the pension to the extent described in the order. The pension plan was divided equally between the parties. The applicant would like to receive her vested interest as a lump sum benefit and the university hoped to regain the balance of the pension asset. The parties applied for a further clarification of their intentions. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The university was to make monthly payments to the applicant of her vested share. Whether this is converted to lump sum payment or continues as monthly payments is exclusively the concern of the University of Regina and the applicant.  2)The 40% share, having vested in the applicant, is a share she may deal with without reference to,or the consent of, the university. This order shall not be acted on until the expiration of 15 days and not then if there shall be an appeal.","The parties divided their matrimonial property in 1985 by agreement as confirmed in a consent order. The order provided that when the husband retired, the wife would receive, as her vested share of his pension, 40% of his benefit. The order also provided that the parties could apply for further directions as necessary. After the husband's retirement, the wife sought to receive her share of the pension from the employer as a lump sum. The husband objected, claiming that he was entitled to any remaining benefit from her share in the event she should predecease him. The wife applied for directions. HELD: The wife is entitled to her share of the pension in any form permitted by the terms of the pension plan. She is also entitled to leave her interest in the pension to a named beneficiary, without reference to or the consent of the husband."
"HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board of Revenue Commissioners reversed. The appellant had appealed under s. 21 of The Revenue and Financial Services Act. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The documents were ordered on the same purchase order and were identified as separate items. Clause 22 of the purchase order, terms and conditions specifies that title passes upon payment. The documentation was separately invoiced. 2)If, as the board found, the purchase of the documents was an independent transaction, was it exempt by virtue of s. 8(1)(f) of the Act? The answer was no. The Board determined as finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use in Saskatchewan and there was evidence before the Board upon which it was open to them to come to that conclusion. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly. 3)The evidence was conclusive that the documents were not being prepared by the Appellant for the purposes of preparation in Saskatchewan. There was no guideline or criteria for the taxing authority to apply. The respondent could look to administrative policy as a factor which may be considered in cases of doubt about the meaning of legislation.","The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax. Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications. The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately. The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board."
"The defendant plead guilty to five theft related charges. The total amount of money involved was $64,000. He was 43 years old and a former Chief of Police for the Town of Kentville. He had used his position of authority as police chief to commit these offences. He has been sentenced to four months consecutive on each count for a total of twenty months incarceration in a provincial institution.","The offender, a former police chief, plead guilty to five theft related charges. The amount of money involved for all five counts was $64,000. He used his position of authority as police chief to commit the crimes. The offender did not have a criminal record. The offences were premeditated, and directed against trusting and well-intentioned organizations. Sentencing the offender to four months consecutive imprisonment on each count, for a total of twenty months, and ordering restitution to the victims,  that the sentence must serve as a message of deterrence to all individuals who hold positions of trust and authority. This message is particularly important to police officers, whose integrity must be beyond reproach."
"The appellant sought an order quashing the adjudicator's decision following a hearing pursuant to s. 62.1 and s.62.2 of The Labour Standards Act. The appellant's president did not examine his company's lease in order to determine whether the adjudication's finding that the respondent's employee had not frustrated or fundamentally breached her employment contract gave rise to the following issues: 1) Did the adjudicating adjudicator err in law by finding that respondent's conduct had not rendered the partiesincapable of performing their contractual obligations; 2) Whether the adjudicators exceeded his jurisdiction by holding that the employer, as the respondent\'s employer, had an obligation to attempt to resolve a matter of work difficulties that hadhibited her from reporting to work; and 3)Whether the adjudicated adjudicator acted well within his jurisdiction when determining what the terms of the respondent`s employment contract were and that Cajon had not fulfilled its obligations therein. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts, as he found them, in addition, his findings of fact cannot be said to be 'patently unreasonable' because there was some evidence upon which he could arrive at his conclusions. Although not all of the facts presented to him were known to the Court, his decision outlines some evidence on which he may have arrived at his conclusion. By not engaging in these further inquiries and efforts outlined above the respondent had not satisfied the adjudent that it was incapable of carrying out its obligations. The doctrine of frustration cannot be applied to the circumstances of this case. 2)The Court found that the adjudicate acted well in his jurisdiction and beyond his prerogative when determining whether the terms and conditions of the appellant's employee's employment contract and that the applicant had not satisfactorily fulfilled her obligations thereunder. The adjudicator did not interfere with the adjudicative process nor with the decision of the adjudications.","The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act. The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations."
"HELD: The plaintiff was dismissed from his position as co-ordinator of post secondary education programs in May 1997. He sought damages for wrongful dismissal. In addition to managing the post secondary programs, he also taught upgrading and university entrance courses and supervised other teaching and support staff. Prior to his employment as a guidance counsellor, he was responsible for the administration of the education complex's facilities and its teaching programs. He was also responsible for supervising and assisting the chief and band council members in preparing the required census reports. For his part, the chief of education staff was fined $10,000 by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada for insubordination and breach of fiduciary duty by the Board of Directors. The plaintiff also sought punitive or aggravated damages. HELD: Awarding the plaintiff $12,394.22 plus pre-judgment interest, that a just cause award is rarely awarded in contract cases where the injured party is essentially entitled to no more than the contract provides. In this case, the plaintiff will have his taxable costs of the proceeding including all necessary disbursements reasonably incurred.","The plaintiff was the coordinator of post-secondary education programs for White Bear First Nation, between 1990 until his termination in May 1997. The plaintiff managed post-secondary programs with an annual budget of $960,000, taught upgrading and university entrance courses, and supervised other teaching and support staff. In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs. There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict. The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct. The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal. The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause. HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed. The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct. There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance. The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract. Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed. Although the plaintiff had been treated unfairly, the plaintiff had not shown that the employer was guilty of harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious conduct."
"Land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval. The applicant applied for tentative subdivision approval in 1997 and received the same in 1998. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. The development officer declared the application incomplete and declared it to be in fact complete. The municipality appealed the decision of the development officer declaring it incomplete. All aspects of s. 283 have been met and the applicant would have been entitled to final approval. There is no question that this entire case involves the interpretation of piece of legislation, but it is significant that the right of appeal is from a refusal. The fact that the applicant failed to comply with the new road standards and one of the bearings on the plan was missing represented a major obstacle for the applicant. The Municipality relies upon s. 278 of the Municipal Government Act in its submission that the higher road standard is applicable. This decision is set aside. On the same basis, the Applicant is entitled to a declaration that the application is complete, (again subject to non-contentious error in the plan).","The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval. In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy"
"The appellants pleaded guilty to fraud over $5000 and were sentenced to two (2) years probation and restitution in the full amount of the overpayment. The Crown and defence advanced a joint sentencing recommendation for two (1)years probation, restitution of one-half of the amount as submitted in the joint recommendation. The appellants applied for leave and, if granted, appealed the judge's decision to order restitution of the full sum rather than one- half of the figure as submitted by the joint report. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was allowed. The joint recommendation was a fit sentence. While the agreement between counsel was, of course, not binding on the judge, the Joint recommendation made to him was a fitting sentence. There was no sound reason for the appellants to depart from it.","The appellants pled guilty to theft over $5,000. The Crown and the defence put forward a joint sentencing recommendation of two years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount of the fraud, which was all that the appellants had actually retained. The sentencing judge ordered full restitution. The appellants appealed; the Crown conceded that the appeal should be allowed. Allowing the appeal, that while the agreement reached by the Crown and the appellants was not binding upon the sentencing judge, the joint recommendation was a fit sentence; in the circumstances there was no sound reason for departing from it."
"The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking, cocaine for the purposes of trafficking and possession of property obtained by crime (s. 5(2) and s. 355(b) of the Criminal Code. The evidence seized by the police was admissible against the accused on the basis that the accused had knapsacks and cash in the vehicle console, which he placed at his feet in the front passenger seat, and a black wallet. HELD: The Crown adduced all of the evidence except for the knapsack which was zipped up and secured by a small lock. The police did not call evidence but argued that this was a circumstantial case in which the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the only reasonable inference to be drawn was that the drugs and money were in the defendant's possession. The accused was found guilty of all three charges before the court. Criminal Code s.4(3) states that anything in possession can be proven by direct evidence or evidence of a person having knowledge of the presence of the item in question, consented to its being there and had some measure of control over it. The possession of cash was proceeds of drug trafficking. The three rolls of cash containing $1000 each were found in the possession of the accused and, because they were in small denominations, found at the same bag as large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the accused was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large sums of cash from any other source, the only logical inference was that these rolls were proceeds of cocaine trafficking. Hence find that the defendant had them in his possession knowing they were obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment.","The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking."
"The Government seeks an order requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars in order for it to properly defend the action and not be taken by surprise. The plaintiff cites samples of cases involving similar open ended phrases and submits that such wording is common and should be permitted by the courts. HELD: 1) The pleadings do not support a claim for damages for breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The Government is entitled to make and enforce regulations with respect to the standards of buildings, equipment, teaching, education, inspection and discipline in connection with residential schools for children. 2) There is no allegation in the appellants' pleadings that the Government acted in its own self-interest and against the interests of either party. The Plaintiff fails to identify the legislative scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for the education of a group of people that included the Plaintiff, was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government. The claim for 'punitive and exemplary damages' is redundant. 3) In circumstances where the plaintiff has no particulars, he must provide particulars of same. The response that the particulars demanded are 'within the knowledge and peruse[sic] of the Defendant and as such, the Plaintiff is not obliged to provide further particulars'. 4) The plaintiff relies on Odger's Principles of Pleading in Civil Actions in the High Court of Justice, 22nd Ed. (London, 1981). 5) The Court is not prepared to strike the phrases complained of. The conduct of the Government in this proceeding evinces a breach of confidence. It is well established within the meaning of the Act that the government is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the residential school for children and the principles and laws of the common law apply. The practice in Canada has been considered by the Supreme Court of Canada and the Court of Appeal in number of recent judgments. 6) The evidence is inadequate to establish a foundation for a reasonable cause of action. The evidence does not exist to establish the prima facie case for the claim.","The Government seeks an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the plaintiff to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and pursuant to Rule 173 of the Rules and order striking portions of the pleadings. HELD: 1) The plaintiff has failed to identify the legislative scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for education of a group of people that included the plaintiff, was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government. The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim."
"The appellant appealed an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. The father paid some maintenance for the child and had extensive access to the child, she spending most of the time with her maternal grandparents. He alleged that the mother was an alcoholic and as a result did not properly care for the children. The mother filed an affidavit denying all of the allegations, and in particular, that she was the alcoholic and that her alcoholism adversely affected the child. She also filed affidavits from three friends and the 16 year old daughter to support her own evidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed. Even assuming that the Investigation Record was admissible, given the direct denial under oath by the mother of either alcoholism or lack of proper care, there should have been an order directing a trial of an issue rather than a decision made on the written evidence. Although Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered.","The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father."
"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine at Rocanville, Saskatchewan. HELD: The plaintiff is awarded $500. The defendant is entitled to costs against the plaintiff and $500 against Sullivan. 1) The trial judge erred in fact in characterizing the plaintiff's actions as mere preparation. The plaintiff competed with her employer for business which had been the employer's. Her placing of the bid went beyond preparation. 2) The court found no case law on point in this province and am unable to distinguish the actions of the defendant in Restauronics Services Ltd. v. Forster. 3) The law is well settled that an employee is under an implied obligation not to compete with an employer during the term of his or her employment. The Court held that the plaintiff in this case was entitled to no more than nominal damages and awarded it the money that was awarded. 4) The plaintiff was not in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. The position of Sullivan when he submitted his proposal was identical to that of the plaintiff. He knew nothing as to profit margins, etc. of his company. He did not consider that to be confidential information or a trade secret. The only issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed. The claim against PCS is dismissed.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs."
"The applicant is 39 years old licensed practical nurse who is employed with the Mamawetan Health Region. She is married to a self-employed carpenter who also lives in La Ronge. They are the biological parents of three children. The applicant commenced a petition in October 2008 in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, The Children's Law Act, 1997, and Family Maintenance Act. HELD: 1) The fact that one is not the biological parent of the children does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide financial support for that child. However, given the short-term relationship and the fact that the applicant has the ability to pay spousal support, a modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the applicant should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem. 2) The applicant has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such that to relieve her from some of the economic hardship that she has encountered as a result of the matrimonial breakdown. It is pertinent to note that this was an application brought by the applicant for interim relief in respect of family property in which the respondent was to pay a sum of $1,500 per month. The respondent may have been in a position to pay but the Court cannot determine that. 3) The respondent has not proven that he stands in locus parentis vis a vis the parties. The application for interim child support is dismissed with costs.","The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed."
"FIAT: The plaintiffs were operating a tractor unit bearing Manitoba licence plates and pulling a semi-trailer bearing an Alberta licence plate. On the 22nd day of August 2004, the plaintiffs were involved in a head on collision on a stretch of highway in the Province of Saskatchewan. The plaintiff sustained right leg injury, lacerations, back injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. The defendant auto insurers of each of the three provinces are named defendants. Saskatchewan, at all material times, was governed by a no-fault insurance regime. The plaintiffs claimed the female plaintiff had not recovered from her injuries and damages were accruing but the extent thereof was not yet known. The defendants, after delivery of the initial pleadings of the opponent, moved to demand better particulars and disclosure of documents. HELD: The defendants' application was granted. Each of the defendants furnished a draft order. Each defendant's application was to issue as an order of the court, save and except for the request for costs in the cause. It would be premature to award costs. The trial judge will be able to see the reply to demands for particulars and be better positioned to assess the merits of these motions than I was able to infer from the material presently before the court.","The litigation revolved around a claim by the plaintiffs for damages that resulted from a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006. In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery. HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence. Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery. In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery. The plaintiff was granted 40 days from the date of the order to reply to the demand for particulars."
"The issue of divorce, custody and access was disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. HELD: 1) The respondent owned one-quarter of the estate land and it is agreed that his share is matrimonial property. Therefore, the Court declined to order any spousal support. 2) The court found that the respondent stands in loco parentis in respect of the three natural children of the marriage. It is also agreed that the petitioner receives the sum of $300 per month from the natural father of the third child. The Court ordered that the sum be taken and added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children to obtain the total payable for the three children. 3) The petitioner is presently employed and the respondent's income is unlikely to increase in the near future. Given the fact that after the respondent pays child support (including the extra costs) the income of the respondent and that of the petitioner will be nearly the same, the court declined toorder any Spousal Support.  4) The Court found that most of the farm equipment should be valued at $115,155.19 less $15,580.00 (being the value of the assets in her possession) leaving a balance of $97,575.19 to be paid to the petitioner, less one-half the costs of the appraisals. The judgment shall be a charge on the petitioner's personal land.","Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs."
"The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the parties provide copies of his tax returns, his notices of assessment for 1999 and 2001 and his contact information for 1999. The parties have been unable to reach an agreement regarding child support and accordingly have proceeded to trial. The issues before the Court are: 1) child support including s. 7 expenses; s. 8 expenses; whether the child support order should be retroactive. 2) costs. The main issues related to the s. expenses and the retroactivity of the support order were mixed. The petitioner asked to pay $1,500 as support for his daughter, [N.G.K.B.] born January 13, 1998; the sum of $293 per month commencing October 1, 2002 and continuing on the first day of each and every month thereafter so long as she remains a child within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The issue of ongoing support was not an issue; the petitioner's income for child support purposes was $35,269.44; although she has no independent needs, there was no prior spending pattern for this Court to consider.","All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old. The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed."
"This is an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision of Arbitrator Ish interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and respondent. HELD: The appeal is dismissed orally. The court found that the arbitrator's finding that the phrase in question was ambiguous and outlined the reasons why each of the competing interpretations might be chosen. This is an incorrect proposition of law. The arbitrator went on, in the alternative, to rely on the other provisions of the agreement; that is, he used one of the appropriate, and, indeed, first tools of statutory interpretation for an ambiguous phrase that is to interpret it in the context of the entire agreement.","This was an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision the arbitrator interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and the respondent. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The interpretation of the arbitrator was a possible interpretation on a legal and grammatical analysis of the entire agreement, and was not patently unreasonable."
The Students' Union and the Students'' Union appealed a Queen's Bench order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The FOI and Students' unions both sought relief under s. 225 of the Act. The former director of the Students’ Union applied to the Court of Queen’s Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act pursuant to the Act and obtained an order declaring it to be Of no force and effect. HELD: The appeals were dismissed with costs.  1) The former Director of the Student Union had standing to bring his application pursuant to s. 222(d) of the act. He had been actively involved in the referendum campaign and was a leading voice against joining the Federation. He was a member of the student council prior to the referendum. He is a proper person to bring the application. 2) The Court of Appeal was entirely satisfied that the former Director was a 'proper person' to bring this application. He did not challenge the actions of the students’ union on the basis that they were in good faith or in accord with the broad rules of natural justice. The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the referendum participants. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. The Court was entirely convinced that the respondent was a “proper Person” to bring that application. The fact that he was a student at the University at the time of the referendum and was active in the debate and during the campaign did not hinder its ability to ratify the result. The issues to which the Court was directed to look at were the same issues in relation to the referenda process. The respondent was clearly involved in both the referendum campaigning and the events leading up to the vote. He played a significant role in the decision to grant the relief requested by the Chambers judge. The appeal was also dismissed with the costs.,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act."
"The father, who claimed a one-half interest in a condominium held jointly by his parents until the death of his mother, sought party and party costs against his son. The father and his daughter were now acting on their own. HELD: The application was not 'estate litigation'; rather, it was litigation between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them. The purpose of an award of costs is to provide the successful party with partial but substantial indemnity against legal fees measured by what would ordinarily be charged to client for the kind of work undertaken on behalf of a successful party in the actual case. The three parties will bear their own costs.  1) It was necessary for the estate to participate in the application because it originally involved questions about Mrs. Hand's property, it involved demand for accounting, and the late Mr. Thomas Burchell, Q.C., was subpoenaed to give evidence about both the administration of the estate and the wills he drafted. 2) The entire application was sham and that no lawyer should be paid anything. There was also an issue about the failure of the representatives of the Hand's estate to provide an accounting. That was resolved only as the hearing began. 3) The central issue in the father's application was the meaning of his daughter's Will. She clearly made a gift to him that failed. The possibility of that failure was brought to the attention of the mother before she executed the will. However, the issue was one between the applicant and his father. Was Dr. Hand required to stand by his 1999 will, including the gift of the condominium to his son? No. Hand was represented in his personal claim by Mr. Piercey who had no involvement with the issues about estate accounting.","A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate. In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister. The parties will bear their own costs. There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded. As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here. The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid. The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation? In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them."
"The plaintiff, Sign-O-Lite, sought damages for breach of contract for alleged negligent misrepresentation. The defendant, Nova, was in the business of manufacturing, selling and leasing commercial signs and had a construction facility in the Truro area. The plaintiff sought to have the defendant's sign removed and damages for unjust enrichment claimed. Awarding the plaintiff $875 per month for 74 months, that it should only be compensated for one-half of the amounts for shifting the signs and the electrical work; that Clause 40 was a condition precedent to the Display Rental Agreement and since the approval was not forthcoming, the contract was null and void and the defendants were not liable for any breach. The alternative claim was that the plaintiff was entitled to compensation on the basis of unjust enrichment since it supplied a sign which had been used for the benefit of the defendants since May 1987. Dismissing the counterclaim without costs, that the evidence showed that the defendant did not misrepresentation on the part of the plaintiff.","The plaintiff sought damages for an alleged breach of a written contract or, in the alternative, damages for unjust enrichment. The defendants counterclaimed for damages based on alleged negligent misrepresentation by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had agreed to supply and erect a large sign for the defendant. The agreement was subject to receiving approval from the Department of Highways for a changeable message centre which was to be part of the sign. The plaintiff was to apply for the permit, as it was the signage expert. Although approval was never received, the sign was delivered and installed. The message centre was never activated, although the equipment was in place at the defendant's warehouse. Dismissing the claim for breach of contract and allowing the unjust enrichment claim, that government approval was a condition precedent to the agreement. Since approval was not forthcoming, the contract was null and void. The plaintiff's alternative claim for unjust enrichment was allowed against the corporate defendant, based on a reasonable monthly rental. The defendant's counterclaim was dismissed, as there was no negligent misrepresentation by the plaintiff."
This was an appeal from an order of the Family Court dismissing the appellant's application to terminate a permanent custody order respecting her son who had been taken into care by the Children's Aid Society shortly after his birth. HELD: The application to adduce evidence on appeal was dismissed. The principles for the reception of fresh evidence were set out in R. v. Palmer (1979) and the Civil Procedure Rule 62.22 which is the general rule governing the hearing of an appeal.,"The applicant sought to adduce fresh evidence on an appeal of a Family Court order which dismissed her application to terminate a permanent custody order respecting her son. Dismissing the application, that the evidence sought to be admitted was either available at trial and was not adduced, was repetitious of evidence given at trial, or was evidence which could not be expected to affect the decision."
"This was an application by the City of Saskatoon and the third parties to strike out the third party claim on the basis that it did not disclose a reasonable cause of action. The claim was advanced in contract and in tort. HELD: The third parties asked the court to grant them leave to bring third party proceedings on an application pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Fire Prevention Act. 1)Do the provisions of s. 136.1(2) of The Urban Municipality Act, 1984 and s. 34 of The Fire Prevention act, 1992 prevent the defendants from taking proceedings against the first and third parties in this case and, if so, should the entire third parties' claim be struck out pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173? 2)As the first parties have not established that the impugned claim cannot succeed, the application is dismissed. 3) As to s. 7 of the Contributory Negligence Act, the court granted the defendants leave nunc pro tunc to bring such party proceedings.","An application to strike out the third party claim as not disclosing a reasonable cause of action. The plaintiffs brought a claim in contract and tort alleging Hagblom caused a fire in their building. The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation. The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence. In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. Leave was granted nunc pro tunc to bring third party proceedings. (1)The third party claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action. It was not plain and obvious the claim could not succeed. It was arguable on the pleadings that the third parties did not act in good faith in that it was alleged they deliberately set out to suppress information and destroy evidence. (2)The statutory limitations will not nullify the third party claim if the allegations relevant to the contention that the third parties did not act in good faith are proven."
"The plaintiff obtained an oral agreement for the payment of fixed commission. In the absence of an enforceable agreement between the parties, the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendants based upon quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. This is an action by the plaintiff, Ciaussen Walters and Associates Limited against the defendants for damages for breach of contract or in the alternative claim for unjust enrichment and Quantum meruit. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was withdrawn. The court was satisfied someone was honestly in error. The defendants had agreed to a 10% commission for the development and sale of the property. The oral agreement was enforceable but the alternative was that an award of unjust enrichment was made to compensate for work done. The plaintiff was awarded costs of the action reserved for later date.","The plaintiff and defendant entered into an oral contract for the development and sale of land. The plaintiff brought an action to recover its commission on the contract. Plaintiff awarded commission of 4% as agreed to by the terms of the oral contract; in the alternative, the plaintiff is entitled to an award for unjust enrichment to compensate for the work done. Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable. An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties."
"The appellant commenced an action against the respondent alleging negligence in the performance of a circumcision. The respondent had performed the circumcision three days after the appellant went into the emergency department complaining of pain. The appellant sought to subpoena the respondent to answer interrogatories that required his opinion, including interrogatories concerning the removal and sewing of the foreskin of the appellant's penis and whether the appellant was referred to him by Ibrahim. The chambers judge refused to appoint the appellant as a court expert and ordered that the appellant answer all of the interrogatories directed to him, including the balance of interrogatories, the majority of which call for his opinion concerning the medical services provided by the respondent, another physician, to the appellant. In performing the circumcision, the appellant underwent three operations on his penis, one of which required a complete and full explanation of the medical treatments he underwent and the subsequent second operation on the appellant, which he underwent as a result of his second corrective surgery. He argued that the trial judge erred in refusing to appoint an expert witness as part of his decision to refuse to appoint a non-party witness to answer certain interrogatories. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that the chambers judge did not err in providing in the order that in the event the appellant serves further interrogatories or requests discovery of the respondent the appellant will pay the expert rate. The distinction between fact and opinion may not be clear. Under Rule 19.02 interrogatories are governed by the same general rule relating to scope as applies to oral discovery. The key tests are relevance to the subject matter of the proceeding and that the answer lies within the knowledge or means of the witness. When the question calls for an opinion it must also be shown that the witness is qualified to answer the question. The issues listed by the appellant in his factum are: Is Dr. Miller in breach of his own Code of Ethics; 2) Should the appellant be appointed court expert; 3) Should he be required to re-answer the interrogatory that require an opinion, but without prejudice to his right to raise a properly supported and articulated objection to answering any particular one as he may be advised. These opinions relate to the treatment provided by Dr.Miller. The issue here is whether the opinions sought by the doctor in this case are opinions which CPR 19 requires be provided. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed in part as provided by Chipman. The standard of review is as follows:","The plaintiff appealed an interlocutory decision in which the chambers judge held that a non-party medical doctor who had provided emergency treatment to the plaintiff did not have to answer certain interrogatories on the basis that they required an opinion. The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial. Appeal allowed in part; the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given. Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided. However, opinions typically asked of an expert witness with respect to the medical services provided by the respondent that were not formed as part of his diagnosis and treatment of the appellant are not required to be provided. Interrogatories cannot be used to usurp the Rules surrounding the use of expert evidence."
"The plaintiff sues in Nova Scotia regarding a motor vehicle accident that occurred in a different jurisdiction. The application says that it is for a determination of question of law pursuant to Rule 25.01. Unfortunately, the application does not say whether the plaintiff is barred from suing in the province of Quebec. The only issue that the applicants appear to have tried to resolve is whether the forum chosen is forum non conveniens. The court has nothing before them as to who did what, who agreed to what, and who disagreed with what prior to hearing of the application. In the absence of so many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called on behalf of the defendant, the court find that Nova Scotia is a forum conveniens and that that is the prima facie right to select the forum of his choice.","The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident in Quebec and commenced an action in Nova Scotia. The applicant applied to determine whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia concerning the Quebec accident and to dismiss the action on the basis that Nova Scotia was a forum non conveniens. Application to dismiss the action dismissed; the forum conveniens is Nova Scotia. The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens. The substantive law governing the proceeding will be the law of the place where the accident occurred and the governing procedural law will be the law of the place of the trial."
"The defendant was charged under s.13(1)(a) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act with failing to take reasonable precautions to ensure the health and safety of persons at a workplace. The charge arose out of a tragic incident aboard a fishing vessel in which a fisher, who was required to perform duties mainly for him, was found to be in a relationship with him that more closely resembled an employee relationship than that of an independent contractor. The deceased was a self-employed fisherman. All four thought of themselves as self-employment fishermen. Harnish owned the boat and one tuna pen. The defendant owned the other tuna pen and boat. The profit sharing agreement between the four was between them and the Crown. They had a profit-sharing agreement pursuant to which 10% of the gross was paid to each fisherman and 10% to the defendant, 10% as boat share and 26% to each of the other fisher. The net profits would be divided equally.","The defendant was charged, as an employer, with failing to take reasonable precautions to ensure the health and safety of persons at a workplace. The defendant and three others had set out to check a tuna pen. The boat was owned by a fourth individual, who was not present at the time. One of the men, despite having no experience diving with scuba equipment and being advised against it by the others, insisted on diving to check the pen. He died of drowning due to inexperienced scuba diving. Defendant not guilty of the offence charged; the defendant was not the deceased's employer. All four individuals thought of themselves as self-employed fishermen and had a profit-sharing agreement; the evidence did not establish that the defendant was acting as skipper or captain in the owner's absence; the defendant was not operating the vessel and the evidence did not show that the defendant had any kind of authority over the other fishers. The deceased was dependant on the boat's owner for the boat and part of the gear, for another individual for the licence and on the defendant for the balance of the gear; the relationship was closer to that of independent contractor than that of employer-employee."
"The appellant appeals from an order of Ryan-Froslie J., which directed that the daughter of the parties, shall attend kindergarten in Saskatoon during the seven week period before trial. The application for variation does not relate to a final order but rather an interim one. HELD: The appeal is dismissed.  1) It is not our function to fine tune orders of this nature particularly when they are of such short duration. We have reviewed the voluminous affidavit evidence in the record and find no misuse of judicial discretion. 2) This Court has signalled its reluctance to interfere with the discretion of a chambers judge when dealing with matters of this sort. In Foss v. Foss, the Court was all of the opinion that this expedited family law appeal must be dismissed. 3) Since we addressed the appeal proper on its merits, the motion to 'quash' is dismissed as moot with no costs to either party.",The appellant appeals from an order that directed that the daughter of the parties shall attend kindergarten in Saskatoon during the 7 week period before trial. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. 1) No error was demonstrated. 2) This Court has signalled its reluctance to interfere with the discretion of a chambers judge when dealing with matters of this nature.
"The issue for the Court was whether Tristen was a 'child of the marriage' as defined by the Divorce Act (and, if so, what his obligation to pay child support should be). The parties married in 2001 and separated in 2008. The parenting and support issues concerning the biological child have been resolved. The respondent is in a relationship with the child and the child is his child. The child is the biological son of the respondent and the respondent is his parent. This is an important decision. The threshold for parental status finding is high and reserved for these cases where a step-parent can be clearly shown to have assumed the role of the natural parent in substantial substitution for the natural parental role. The Court found that the respondent did not'stand in the place of a parent' when this decision was made.","The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here."
"FIAT: The defendants apply for an order setting a date for the hearing of the plaintiffs' application for an Order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to The Class Actions Act as am. HELD: Although the time lines established by the court have expired, there will be an order granting leave to the plaintiffs to serve and file an application extending the times within which steps may be taken leading up to the Hearing of the Plaintiffs' certification motion. If the plaintiffs fail to serve or file the application by August 27, 2010, the defendants may apply for a remedy.",Defendants brought an application for an order setting a date for the plaintiffs' application for certification of the class action. The plaintiffs had failed to meet the litigation schedule by failing to deliver their written arguments and authorities and had not applied for an extension. HELD: The order of the Court established a timeline for the plaintiffs certification application and set a hearing date.
"The bankrupt applied for his discharge from bankruptcy. His statement of affairs showed assets of $171,255 (mostly exempt or encumbered) against unsecured debts totalling $433,750, and secured debt of $150,000. The bankrupt claimed to have been insolvent since 2002, due to the combined forces of drought and BSE. He sought a conditional order of discharge in the amount of $188 per month for a total of $2,256. HELD: The bankrupt was granted an absolute discharge by virtue of s. 172(2) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. He was ordered to pay $8,000 in addition to surplus income. This amount was to be paid in installments of $300 per month. The judge had ample opportunity to assess the merits, review the documentary evidence and hear his position and found him to be completely unreasonable. He should be able to comply with this order within three years which is considered an acceptable period of time for a bankrupt to be burdened with a conditional Order.","The Bankrupt applies for his discharge from bankruptcy. The discharge is opposed by the Credit Union and the trustee. The Bankrupt was a cattle farmer. He financed this undertaking principally through the Credit Union. HELD: The Bankrupt will be discharged conditional upon payment of $8,000 in addition to surplus income of $2,250 to his estate for the benefit of his creditors. He should be able to comply with this order within 3 years.  1) The bankrupt is 42 years old and a first time bankrupt. He is employed with an excavating company and earns $20 an hour and works as much as 160 hours per week. He is paying $1,000 per month on his mortgage and is trying to catch up on mortgage arrears to stave off foreclosure. He is working hard and living a subsistence life. However, he still has some funds left with an income level above the Superintendent's Standard for a family of two. 2) His assets are less than $.50 on the dollar. His creditors were put to the unnecessary expense by his frivolous or vexatious defence of their claim and he failed to comply with the duties of a bankrupt by failing to produce proper records and assist the trustee to the fullest. He has been abusive and disrespectful throughout."
"The parties met in 2000. The father had had primary residence by interim order but that arrangement was fraught with difficulty for reasons which could not be explored. The mother, Sherri, asks that the principal residence be varied and awarded to her son. HELD: 1) The best interests test governs the determination on the issue of primary residence. Although the father has abdicated a significant chunk of his caregiving role to his mother and sisters, the court has found him not entitled to the Child Tax benefits and had been overpaid. There are red flags. The evidence shows that the father is prone to frequent interruptions of the mother's counsel. He has made a concerted effort to improve his parenting skills and the children have become increasingly distant and disrespectful in the care of their father. This has adversely affected the children's relationship with their mother. It is appropriate to give a consideration to the relationship of the child to the psychological parent, the bond between them, and the importance of maintaining stability in that relationship. 2) The father has bounced from home to home. The only other outcome of the pre-trial conference was an agreement to pursue mediation. Mediation never occurred, purportedly because the father was unable to afford it. Despite his physical injuries, he was assisting with the renovations. The children are currently occupied by the mother.","The parties agree that joint custody is appropriate, but the petitioner mother asked that the principal residence of the two boys be varied and awarded to her. The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well. The children have been primarily residing with the father. The father has been in three motor vehicle accidents within three years and is facing criminal charges as a result of the most recent one. The father works long hours as a maintenance man. The mother has four other children from previous relationships. The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home. The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education. One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care. While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home. The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort. The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way. HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall. The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father. Joint custody was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines."
"The accused is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown now applies for third recognition. The Court reviewed the accused's criminal history and gave him a binder of materials filed as Exhibit P-1. It was found that an objective person armed with the same knowledge would agree that the fears of Corporal Teniuk, the RCMP Sergeant in charge of the RCMP High Risk Offender Response Unit, and Ms. Woytiuk, a Parole Board member, that the accused will commit either a serious personal injury offence or sexual assault involving someone under the age of 16 years and requests that R.N.S. be bound over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for a period of time that does not exceed 12 months. HELD: The accused is remanded to November 12. The accused has already completed moderate intensity programming for sexual offending on his prior sexual assaults and is now assessed as high risk to re-offend sexually and required to complete high intensity sex offender programming. The Progress Reports are unbiased and present in professional and accurate manner. There is no evidence that the statements made by the accused in relation to his last sentence and stay at the Federal Penitentiary in Prince Albert are unreliable. There are a number of factors that contribute to the assessment of a person's risk to offend and the Court was unable and unwilling to make generality of that sort of evidence.","Criminal Law – Recognizance The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety."
"FIAT: In this application, one of the Szwagierczak's five daughters seeks an order directing a trial to prove the 2013 Will in solemn form. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The Court was satisfied that the applicant had not made out a genuine issue for trial yet. There is nothing mysterious about the role of suspicious circumstances in this respect. The presumption simply casts an evidentiary burden on those attacking the will. Accordingly, the application must be dismissed.  2) There is no question that the testator knew the contents of the will, freely approved of those contents and possessed the necessary testamentary capacity. However, the presumption, short-lived and the evidence will affect the ability of the propounder to rely on the presumption. The Court reviewed the authorities and found that the threshold for the challenge is reasonably low. 3) The test in Quaintance is, as is the general statement of the issue to be determined in Dieno, based in the context of jurisprudence respecting the wishes of testator and validity of will. 4) Where there are suspicious circumstances there is a presumption, which is spent and reassumes the legal burden of proving knowledge and approval. Both of these issues must be proved in accordance with the civil standard. 5) It is not necessary for challengers of will to present evidence that will convince the court as to the merits of their case. Rather, it is necessary only to satisfy the court that there is 'a genuine issue to being tried' with respect to the grounds on which the challenge was based, such as lack of testamentary capacities or the presence of undue influence or undue influence. 6) The propounders must consider all of the evidence presented and make a preliminary assessment of the merits. This is an option for the Chambers judge if the evidence itself is not in dispute and the only questions are the inferences to be drawn from the facts.","Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity."
"The parties were married fifteen years. There were no children. The petitioner had concerns during the marriage that she was underpaid. She spent a lot of time under medical care in an effort to become pregnant. At the time of separation she suffered a miscarriage. She now sought a lump sum or periodic term of maintenance to allow her to upgrade her education so that she will become financially independent. The parties lived together as common law spouses. This was an application for interim maintenance. HELD: The Court awarded the petitioner $100 per month maintenance. The amount was inappropriate. To move matters along towards the goal of financial independence and considering the means, needs, and circumstances of each spouse, acknowledging that this may not be the basis for lump sum maintenance or monthly periodic maintenance being made at the time the divorce is heard, I find there is some causal relationship between the petitioner's attempts to obtain a new car and the fact that she did not upgrade her Education during themarriage.","Where the petitioner demonstrated that she did not upgrade her education during the marriage as a result of her attempts to become pregnant and thus there was a causal connection between the petitioner's need and the marriage, interim maintenance in the amount of $100 per month was ordered ,  having regard to the means, needs and circumstances of each spouse."
"This was an appeal from an order that determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the appellant's pension plan during negotiations which took place during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with written reasons to follow. 1)The parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or instalment basis must be clear. 2)The fiat ended: Pre-trial for continuation with respect to maintenance, jewellery and debts of the wife incurred.","After a series of pre-trial conferences, and the exchange of some correspondence between the parties lawyers, the husband took the position that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of his pension. The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice."
"The respondent was convicted of driving with an illegal blood alcohol level (BAC) after a stop by RCMP. He was given a breathalyzer on the basis that he was impaired by alcohol. The Crown appealed on the ground that the summary conviction appeal court decision had erred respecting arbitrary detention and the exclusion of evidence of the breathalyzers result under s. 24(2) of the Charter. The respondent appealed on grounds that the stop was an improper exercise of his right to counsel pursuant to s. 9 of the Canadian Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that the wording of the Saskatchewan Act and the Saskatchewan Police Act do not constitute reasonable and probable grounds to justify random stops. The broad wording of s. 119 of the Highway Traffic Act and its authorized breathalycers is not the only reason why the stop should be justified.","The respondent was convicted at trial with illegal blood alcohol level while operating a motor vehicle. The police had stopped the respondent when they observed the passenger putting on a seat belt. When the respondent went to the police cruiser, the police observed signs of impairment. The summary conviction appeal court held the stop was random and constituted an arbitrary detention infringing the respondent's s.9 Charter rights. The Crown appealed. Allowing the appeal and restoring the conviction. Random stops are arbitrary detentions infringing the Charters. 9 but are saved by s.1. They are authorized in Nova Scotia under Motor Vehicle Act provisions. In the course of checking licences, registration, insurance policy and mechanical condition police are justified in making observations to detect drinking drivers; the right to counsel under s. 10(b) is suspended during this period."
"This was an application by the defendant for an order pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction severing the issues of liability and damages. The defendant argued that a trial of liability would be unnecessary given the quantum of damages claimed by the plaintiffs and given the volume of evidence necessary to prove the aspect of the claim, the prior determination of liability may result in a very significant reduction in trial time and costs. HELD: The application for severance of the issues should only be granted for the compelling reasons and in cases in which it is probable that the trial of one issue will put an end to the action. Liability was in issue. The plaintiffs had served demand that the issue of liability be heard by a jury. The judge must have some evidence which will enable him to determine liability. The Court found that no jury, whether discharged or not, can be reassembled some time later to carry on with the second part of the trial. Such a trial would require a lot of repetition of the same testimony and would be prejudicial to the plaintiffs.","The Defendants applied to sever the issues of liability and damages for purposes of the trial of this matter. The trial was to be held before a jury.HELD: 1)The Court has a general discretion as to severance of issues which must be exercised judicially. 2)Severance should only be ordered when the judge has a serious reason to believe that the trial of the issue proposed to be severed will put an end to the action. 3)The Court accepted the Plaintiff's submission that expert medical evidence would be necessary to establish the cause of the accident since the Plaintiff had suffered brain damage and would be unable to testify. This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found. 4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages. A jury cannot be disassembled and then recalled to conclude the trial of the remaining issues. 5)The Court was of the view that there should be compelling reasons before issues should be severed for trial, but that no compelling reason had been established in this case."
"The father applied to reduce the amount of unpaid child support owing to his 2 daughters from $600 per month to $14,600. The original corollary relief judgment was made in 1989 except that an order suspending enforcement of arrears during periods when the respondent was unemployed was granted. HELD: A flexible order was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support of $300 per child during months when his gross monthly earnings are $2,200.00 or greater and $150.00 per month for a further $7,000.00 arrear. If the father earns more than $2200 per month or more and is in receipt of social assistance benefits he shall pay $200 per person on arreary in addition to the on-going child support obligation. 1)Given the significant reduction in income experienced by the respondent since 1994, there has been a material change in circumstances. Since his employment is uncertain in his trade a flexible order would be appropriate.","The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600. The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate."
"The mother sought retroactive child and spousal support. She claimed her former husband did not pay sufficient support when both she and the children were dependent upon him. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The primary purpose of a support order is not tocompensate for past failure but instead, to satisfy present need. Although the mother was entitled to make a claim for support whenever she believed the father's contribution to be inadequate, she did not do so until 1996 and then did not prosecute her claim for another two years at a time when neither she nor the childrenwere dependent. 2)The respondent was found not guilty.","The petitioner sought retroactive child and spousal support of $47,367. No children were presently dependent upon her and she was self-sufficient. The parties married in 1963. The mother was a homemaker until 1983 when they bought and operated a small town hotel which ultimately failed in 1990. The petitioner alleged they separated in 1990 when the father left the province to seek work elsewhere. He sent no money for two years until 1992 when he sent $3,200 and bought a washer and dryer. She commenced a divorce action in 1996 which was adjourned sine die by consent. The marriage was dissolved in June 1998. The respondent did not keep records of money sent as he did not consider they had separated until 1993. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1)Nothing turned on the actual date of separation which was difficult to determine. The mother was entitled to make a claim for support whenever she believed his contribution was inadequate, whether or not she perceived herself separated from him. 2)The primary purpose of a support order is not to compensate for past failure but to satisfy present need. Making a retroactive order would not address that purpose. She did not make a claim until 1996 and then did not prosecute her claim for another two years, at a time when neither she nor the children were dependent."
"The bankrupt was in bankruptcy for 28 months. He raised two preliminary issues regarding the use of tax information concerning his common law spouse and the company she was sole director andshareholder of. HELD: 1)Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules requires that affidavit evidence must be based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge. The Court was not satisfied that any of these facts had been proved. Based upon the evidence and submissions, the Court concluded that the recommendation of the trustee was reasonable and appropriate. An investigation conducted by the R.C.M.P. as a result of the superintendent's investigation was not of final nature. 2)The bankrupt's claim was for $58,720.34. 3)The principle and exemption contained in s.295(5)(a) of the Excise Tax Act would allow disclosure of information relating to the history of payments of goods and services tax. The bankrupt's motivation was genuine. He was simply trying to keep his business afloat. The information disclosed in paragraph 19 of the affidavit was confidential and disclosure was improper.","Revenue Canada, which was owed $166,359.72 for goods and services tax for 1991-92 and $14,223.30 for 1991 unpaid personal income tax, and the Michaluks, who were owed $58,720.34 for a failed agreement and lease on their property in Manitoba, objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt. The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action. The conclusion of the investigation conducted by the RCMP as a result of the superintendent's investigation order was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution."

"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the respondent held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit union became a tenant at sufferance when it failed to remove the quonal. The question is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intention to do so. HELD: The appeal is allowed. The judgment is dismissed. 1) The evidence falls well short of proving that the plaintiff could have derived any rent from the property, had the building not been there, beyond the amount that the applicant actually recovered. The reasonable rental value can be estimated, albeit with limitations, by reference to the amount of improvement taxes the plaintiff had to pay to keep the town from taking the property for taxes. 2) It is common ground that Gari took possession of the building and rented it out for storage. These actions on its part reflect the terms of its lease with Lakeland. The Credit Union did not advance a claim either in trespass or on a basis that s. 65(5) of the PPPA itself creates a cause of action. The analysis of the parties' positions must proceed on that same basis, i.e. that, as of September 1, Gari was seeking security for possible damage caused by removal of the Building but was not seeking rent and reimbursement for taxes paid. The cross-appeal is a separate action and should not be taken as a substitute for a remedy. If the issue is decided in favour, it will also be necessary to consider the merits of the specific claims advanced by Gari.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails."
"The issue between the parties was the amount of child maintenance payable by the respondent to the petitioner for the benefit of Brady Melvin, born January 9, 1993. The amount of the respondent's income, as reported in his income tax return for the years 2001, 2002, and 2003 was $71,501, $73,272 and $74,476. He asserted that the indebtedness of the company was $1,600,000. However, nearly $600,600 of that debt represents shareholders loans. HELD: The respondent was ordered to pay $550 per month as child support for Melvin, on the basis of his annual income of $72,800, the sum of $561.00 per month. 1)The respondent was the sole shareholder of Canadian Well Servicing Ltd. and he owns 50% of the shares of the same company. 2)Imputing the annual income to be $150,000 with adjustments based on the total of $88,900 incurred by the parties for child maintenance. 3)The petitioner was entitled to costs of the application.","The issue is the amount of child support payable by the respondent. The respondent's income as reported in his income tax return for the past 3 years has been in the $70,000 range. However, he is also the sole shareholder of a corporation and the 50% owner of another corporation. The corporations have been very profitable and the retained earnings of both companies far exceed the amount of long term debt. HELD: 1) The respondent has deemed additional income of $50,000 and $27,200 from the two companies. 2) The imputed annual income of the respondent is $150,000. 3) Costs in the amount of $750 to the petitioner."
"The Crown conceded that there was no reason to detain the accused youth to ensure her attendance in court, before she had a trial, before anyone had given evidence against her, under oath, in a court of law, and before she has had a chance to defend herself at a trial. HELD: The youth was released on strict conditions which will continue until her trial was completed. The court accepted the Crown's position that the incident was the third, recent, serious offence to take place in our community and that the public was so disturbed and shocked by the occurrence, that to release the youth would cause a loss of confidence in the administration of justice on the part of the public. The public is aware that we do not keep a person in custody simply because they are accused of committing an offence. There must be a necessary and substantial reason to keep them in custody before they have another trial. The youth will have a necessary sentence according to law and the legal process is underway.","The Crown asks that the accused youth be detained. The Crown concedes that there is no reason to detain the accused youth to ensure her attendance in court or to prevent further occurrences. The Crown asks that she be detained because the crime is so horrible, the case is so strong and the public in La Ronge are so disturbed and shocked by the occurrence that to release the youth would cause a loss of confidence in the administration of justice.

"FIAT: This is an application for an order striking out the plaintiff's claim in defamation. The application is brought pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173. The Court may at any stage of an action order any pleading or any part thereof to be struck out, with or without leave to amend, on the ground that: (a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action; (c) it is scandalous, frivolous and vexatious; (e)it is otherwise an abuse of the process; and (f) the test is disclosed and the quoted test has not been met. The plaintiff will have his costs fixed at $400 in any event of the cause.HELD: The application was dismissed. The court declined to grant the order. While several affidavits were filed, none of them spoke to the circumstances wherein the impugned remarks were made, most importantly there was no assertion by the defendant that the comments were made in the course of her duties or were received by persons with a corresponding duty.","FIAT: This is an application for an order striking out the plaintiff's claim in defamation pursuant to rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The court declined to strike the claim. 1) Contrary to the submissions of counsel for the defendant, all essential elements of a claim in defamation are set out. A reasonable cause of action is disclosed. 2) None of the affidavits filed speak to the circumstance wherein the impugned remarks were made. Most importantly, there is no assertion by the defendant that the remarks were made in the course of her duties or were received by persons with a corresponding duty."
"The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging that the Crown's intention to adduce the newly discovered evidence has adversely affected her s. and 11(d) Charter rights. She had no knowledge of the contents of the prisoner package seized following the search of Thomas Izzard and of the other evidence seized from her home pursuant to a search warrant executed soon thereafter. To that end, she negotiated a number of matters with the Crown. At very early stage of the trial, defence counsel was aware that the information was in the possession of the Crown and therefore, aware that it could be used to impeach the accused's testimony and contradict things she had told to Sergeant Kelly in her video taped statement. The accused sought and was granted a continuance of the publication ban on the 'newly discovered evidence' after a mistrial. The Crown appealed the decision. HELD: The accused has succeeded in proving a breach of her right to make full answer and defence. A mistrial was ordered. The evidence goes to the mens rea element of the offences alleged against the accused and goes directly to the issue of her credibility. There was no suggestion that Crown disclosure was incomplete. The Court was satisfied that the accused had made significant strategic decisions regarding her re-election, including not re-electing a judge by mistake and making sure that any motion to dismiss was made before trial was made. However, the Court was not satisfied that Crown counsel had no prior knowledge of this evidence and that until last week, neither did the immediate investigative team. Counsel acted quickly and appropriately when he learned of the new evidence. This is an important case because it could lead to the establishment of a new criminal statute. It is not enough to show non-disclosure; rather actual prejudice must also be demonstrated.","The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence. Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function."
"The defendant AGC moved for summary judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 13.03 (1)(a) and (c) on the grounds that the plaintiff's amended statement of claim did not meet the sufficiency of claim. The AGC argued that the defendant's conviction and seizure of property in 1996 did not create a cause of action as it did not attack the validity of the 1996 warrant and restraint orders. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's action was not based on the statutory undertakings given by the AGC in 1996. While this is a significant factor, it does not necessarily defend against this summary judgment application based on his pleadings. 2) The amendments did not add to the Statement of Claim that was before Justice LeBlanc.","Rule 13.03 – Summary judgment on pleadings, motion granted on the basis of Rule 13.03(1)(c)). While the claim discloses a possible cause of action based on the Attorney General's statutory undertakings, this alone doesn't decide the matter. The amendments add nothing by way of necessary detail to the claim, which doesn't plead sufficient material facts to comply with the Rules on pleadings (see Rule 4.02)."
"HELD: The court granted interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month for three children. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit of October 2012. The petitioner did not oppose the respondent remaining in the home on a time limited basis and suggested it should terminate June 27, 2013. The parties did not reach an agreement on all issues. The court reviewed the contents of the document and indicated it could not be relied upon until ruled on its admissibility. It found the petitioner to have a Guideline income of $87,178 and the respondent a figure of $18,884. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support of $1,213 per month, on account of child care expenses of $3,200 per month. On an interim basis, the court ordered that monies which he had paid from September 2012 onward be credited to the monies paid.  2)The court was satisfied that the policy considerations which underly settlement privilege required that unless all of the issues have been resolved, privilege continues to extend to those issues where there may not be a clear understanding and agreement that once one of the issue is resolved it is off the table and considered to be settled irrespective of what may happen with respect to other issues.","The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference."
"The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. The complainant testified that she was home every Friday night with the appellant. She also claimed that he touched her breasts and inside her pants on numerous occasions. The Crown called a counsellor who testified that her mother, sister, brother and girlfriend flatly contradicted the complainant as to the time she said the acts took place. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge erred in allowing such evidence and treating it as relevant to the complainant's credibility if, in fact, that is what he actually did. The question then was whether the admission of the hearsay evidence was an error so grave as to call for a quashing of the conviction. After considering the entire record, it was concluded that the appellant's evidence was admissible. Allowing the appeal and finding that the verdict was one that a properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered.","Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility. Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered."
"The only issue to be determined in this application was the amount of monthly maintenance to be paid by the respondent to the applicant as support for their child who was born on September 30, 1986. Both parties were medical practitioners and each enjoyed significant income. HELD: 1)The applicant was to be responsible for approximately 2/3 of the monthly expenses.  2)The significant income enjoyed by the applicant was a factor to be taken into consideration when determining amount ofmaintenance to be Paid by the Respondent, particularly when I'm prepared to recognize a significant portion of the applicant's claim for extra-ordinary expenses. 3)The child support application was adjourned until May 1997 for any monies made out to the parties.  4)The father was to pay $150,000 to cover nanny and child care expenses. 5)The claim for recreation and a university fund was justified pursuant to s7(1)(c) of the guidelines. 6)The respondent was to contribute to the monies paid out by the parties since 1997.","The only issue was the amount of monthly maintenance to be paid by the respondent for the one child. The average income of the respondent over the past three years was approximately $180,000. The applicant claimed her 1996 income of $128,000 was extra-ordinary as payment was received for projects completed in the previous two years. The applicant claimed special monthly expenses of $1,200 to cover nanny and child care costs, $125 for medication, $25 for recreation and $200 for a university fund. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay $1,794 per month. Section 4 of the guidelines was applicable. The significant income of the applicant is a factor to be taken into consideration. 2)The applicant did not establish that the claims for recreation and the university fund were expenses that were 'special' or 'extra-ordinary'. 3)The respondent was responsible for 2/3 of the nanny and child care costs which were justified pursuant to s7(1)(c) of the guidelines."
"The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondents following trial on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan. The Crown argued that the trial judge erred in law by failing to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and an Aboriginal rights defence. HELD: The Crown's motion was granted. The issues were set out in the following ways: 1) The trial judge failed to consider the Aboriginal right of fish for commercial purposes; 2) The Crown failed to take into account the fact the respondents were Metis and did not establish that they were hunting for food to feed themselves or their families; 3) The Court found the accused not guilty on counts 3, 4 and 5 but for the constitutional defence which he had established. It is open to the accused to attempt to establish that their clients have an Aboriginalright to fish For Commercial purposes as well as to make out all the charges against them. 4) The defence counsel for the accused served notice of the constitutional question they intended to raise on behalf of the accused on the Attorney General. The notice identified their aboriginal right as protected under the Constitution of Canada and included references to s. 91(24) and 146 of the Constitution Act, 1867 along with the Rupert's Land and North Western Order passed pursuant a s. 146. 5) The acquittals based on the constitutional argument were apprised of the change in the Crown's position. The accused made it known to the Crown from the outset that they would also be offering a constitutional defence in which they claimed their aboriginal rights to fish were infringed by the Saskatchewan Fishing Regulations. They were doing so in a manner consistent with their Aboriginal right. The proper characterization of the aboriginal right was that the offences with which the accused were charged did not relate to commercial fishing, but applied whether the fishing was for domestic consumption or for commercial purpose. The Court concluded that commercial fishing was not an issue in this case and ordered the defence to revise their Brief in light of the issue.","The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified."
"The appellant appealed his conviction on a charge of dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in criminal proceedings. A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of certain statements made to a member of the Regina City Police Force. The voir de dire concluded that statements made made pursuant the HighwayTraffic Act could not have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. A new trial in the Provincial Court was ordered. 1)Had the Charter issues been properly raised and argued before the learned trial judge, a conclusion different from the one reached (based solely upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness) may have resulted. 2)Had there been a voir dure, a different conclusion was reached (and possibly a different approach to the evidence that counsel for either the accused or the Crown may adduce in the voir net in order to establish the Charter argument, a conviction would have resulted.)","An appeal of conviction on a charge of dangerous driving on the grounds the trial judge erred in holding that statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in the criminal proceedings; and in holding the statements could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police and therefore were voluntary and admissible. The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement. Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal. Objections to the admissiblilty of the accused's statements based upon the Charter raise a different issue and considerations from the application of common law principles and a different conclusion may have been reached."
"FIAT. The applicant sought an order declaring that the solicitors for the plaintiffs had breached confidentiality and were in conflict of interest between clients. She asked that they be removed as solicitors of record. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs. A fiduciary relationship was created between the applicant and the law firm when the documents were accepted. That relationship was close enough to a solicitor-client retainer to give rise to a need for confidentiality. The documents contained confidential information, it was submitted that the public's confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined if any member of the firm were now allowed to act for the plaintiff. There was no evidence that a solicitor client relationship existed and no other duty was owed to Lois. The affidavit to the effect that she did not discuss with or reveal to other members of the Law firm the contents of the documents is not sufficient to satisfy the public requirement that there be no appearance of breach of confidentiality.","FIAT. The applicant sought a declaration that the plaintiffs' solicitors had breached confidentiality and were in a conflict of interest and asked that they be removed as solicitors of record in this action. The applicant's husband had given her personal letters, records and documents to his solicitor in 1995. These documents were relevant to a defamation action brought by her children or their spouses. The applicant argued that a fiduciary relationship was created when the documents were accepted which was close enough to a solicitor-client retainer to give rise to a need for confidentiality and that the public's confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined if any member of that law firm acted for the plaintiffs. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs. No solicitor-client relationship was created between the husband's lawyer and the applicant when the documents were received. There was no breach of confidentiality or conflict of interest as contemplated by Chapters IV and V of the Code of Professional Conduct. No fiduciary duty was owed to the applicant when the solicitor accepted the documents from the applicant's husband. The husband was not acting as agent for his wife nor was it accepted that he delivered the documents for safe keeping. The husband's solicitor had forwarded the documents to the applicant's lawyer. The fact that the husband now supported his wife in the defence of her action did not change the situation that existed in 1995."
"The defendant, the Government of Saskatchewan, tendered a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. Four companies submitted tenders in response to the defendant's invitation to tender. The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender which was awarded to another tenderer who had previous experience in the area and whose planes received favourable reports. HELD: The plaintiff was treated fairly and the defendant was awarded the contract. The court found that the plaintiff compensated for its lack of experience by making arrangements to bring on board an experienced sub-contractor, a fact Stanley did not know at the time. The defendant did not check the log books of any of the planes he investigated because he testified it was not common practice to do so, and it would have given him little relevant information on the operational viability of the plane. The project was first for the defendant and no unfair advantage was given to Nielsen Ashdown in selecting the successful tenderer. The action was dismissed.","The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender of four made in response to the defendant's invitation to tender on a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The tender package contained the usual privilege clause which stated the lowest tender need not be accepted. It is an implied term of the contract that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenders fairly and will not give any an unfair advantage.  2)The plaintiff had no experience in the type of pesticide spraying. It was not known at the time that the plaintiff made arrangements to hire an experienced subcontractor. The consultant hired to advise the defendant on the technical aspects of the project used reliable independent sources for his information about the operational viability of the planes. He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.  3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment."
"FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to Rules 344 and 388 of the Queen's Bench Rules directing the manner in which monies paid into Court pursuant to garnishee summonses should be distributed between the parties. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)Three Bars Holdings Ltd. shall pay salary of $2,000 per month. The cheques shall be payable at month end subject to normal deductions for Canada Pension, income tax and any statutory deduction.  2)The parties who are brothers, have been involved in dispute over the division of farming assets since July 30, 1999. A pre-trial conference commenced December 22, 2000 and has been adjourned for February 2, 2001. 3)Two separate entities were created to administer the operation and to monitor the accounts of each entity. 4)Three bars Holdings Ltd.'s receiver-manager was appointed. 5)The applicant was awarded costs of the application payable forthwith.","FIAT. The plaintiff sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 344 and 388 directing the manner in which monies paid into court pursuant to garnishee summonses and other monies should be distributed between the parties. He requested two 1999 orders be amended to the extent necessary to give the relief requested. The brothers had been involved in a dispute over the division of farming assets since July 1999. A third party commenced legal action in QB No.3510/99 against the brothers and garnisheed revenues from the Pregnant Mare Urine operation for approximately 1 year. The brother's application for an injunction to permit him to take over the operation was dismissed in the January 12, 2001 fiat. His application to set aside the garnishee summonses was granted and all sums paid into court and interest were to be returned subject to provisions in fiat QB No.2259/99. The plaintiff alleged the breach of conditions in the previous orders entitled him to bring this application. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs of $750 payable forthwith. The plaintiff was essentially asking the court to sit on appeal. The orders were clear."
"After a decree nisi of foreclosure issued, but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners applied for judicial sale of the mortgaged property, being the matrimonial home. The relief sought was for an order that the property be listed with a private realtor for fixed time at an upset (listing) price of $120,000. The mortgagee, Border Credit Union, opposed the application and the co-owner, Sandra Klarenbach, did not participate in the hearing. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court's entitlement to order judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. See Saskatoon Credit Union Ltd. v. Gozanski & Co. The property was listed for sale by the applicant in February 2002. This is not the proper forum to attempt to effect a family property settlement.","FIAT. After a decree nisi of foreclosure had issued but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners (the former husband) applied for judicial sale of the matrimonial home. The joint owners separated in 1999 and are involved in an acrimonious family law court action. The wife has exclusive possession of the property. The Credit Union as first mortgagee opposed the application. The co-owner did not participate. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)This is not the proper forum to attempt to affect a family property settlement. The husband was not entitled in these proceedings to a possession order. The wife prevented every attempt to show the property to prospective owners. There was no reason to assume she will be any more cooperative with a court appointed realtor. The Credit Union did not request immediate possession. 2)The court's entitlement to order a judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. The court reviewed the history of the statutory authority for a judicial sale in a mortgage foreclosure proceedings. The 1852 Chancery Procedure Amendment Act was repealed in 1881 and replaced by Ordinance 51, Rule 1, which became law in the NWT by virtue of the Judicature Ordinance No.6 of 1893. It is now found in s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act in its modified form. Deciding whether it is 'necessary or expedient' within the meaning of s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act is, however, a judicial exercise."
"The appellants were convicted by a Queen's Bench trial judge of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and the Health Of Animals Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was a fine of $69,000. The appellants appealed the sentence on the basis that the fines were too harsh and the consecutive sentences exceeded the overall capability of the offender to pay. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed by the Criminal Code are $750,000 and the total sentence was $724 days. 2)The trial judge did not take the appellants' rehabilitation into consideration. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, he cannot find that the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'. Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit.  3)Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s.734(8) of the Criminal code, this appeal is dismissed.","DIGEST The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000. HELD: 1) The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents. The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public. The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry. This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.  2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000. The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'. Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit. 3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed."
"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay is approximately thirty-one months. There was no waiver of the delay caused by the adjournments from May 2004 to November 2005. 2) The weather caused delay from November 29, 2006 to January 19 2007. 3) The accused suffered actual prejudice because the outstanding charge has affected her ability to apply for higher-paying job opportunities and has caused her stress and frustration. She further alleges that the passage of time makes it more difficult to properly defend against the charges. Actions of the accused include delay until she was ready to enter pleas, and then to have the matter rescheduled for trial.","The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather."
"The applicant sought to vary the child support terms of the Corollary Relief Judgment. The parties had an agreement that they would share joint custody of their two children, with the primary responsibility being to pay child support based on the income of the wife. The husband opposed the application on the grounds that he was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. He argued that his RRSP income should not be considered when calculating child support as it is a recurring income figure over the past four years and was not an adjustment contemplated by Schedule III. The applicant asked to have the amount of child support adjusted for inflation and the spousal support and should be deducted as an adjustment pursuant to Schedule III, but the Respondent transferred to the applicant by way of RRSP rollover $40,000 and waived her entitlement of spousals support. The previous variation order was a consent order which was approved by the court and was in effect until the date of the last order. The court was not prepared to retroactively vary the terms of that order or its terms in any event. The current circumstances were not reasonable to require the Court to look beyond the respondent's line 150 income for child support purposes. The respondent's contribution to the children's financial support is modest and there is no reason to decrease it.","The corollary relief judgment provided that the parties would share parenting of their two children approximately equally. Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue. Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms."
The applicants are defendants in an action commenced by the respondent University of Saskatchewan. They applied to have the University's claim against them dismissed for want of prosecution. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted. The court found enough merit in the applicants' arguments to warrant granting leave. The appeal is of sufficient importance to warrant the Court's dispatch.,"The applicants applied for leave to appeal from a Chambers decision denying their application to dismiss the respondent's claim against them for want of prosecution. The applicants were partners in an architecture firm that provided design drawing and specifications for the construction of the Education Building at the University of Saskatchewan. The building was substantially completed in 1970. In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building. In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss. In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief. In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer. The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997. Between 1997 and 2010, documents were exchanged, discoveries were held and an unsuccessful settlement negotiation was held. In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution. The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant. Secondly, the issue of delays in litigation is important and the case will present an opportunity for the Court to clarify the legal framework pertaining to such matters."
"The accused is charged with consuming alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown entered a stay of proceedings on the other count on the Information, which alleged impaired operation of motor vehicle. HELD: The accused abandoned his Charter application under ss. and thereof. The issue to be determined is whether the accused is able to establish on a balance of probabilities that his rights to counsel under s. 10(b) have been breached, such that the Court should order an exclusion of evidence in accord with s. 24 of the Charter. As well, the Court must determine whether the Crown met any onus on it to establish that the accused had waived his rights.","The accused asserted that his rights to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached because the police officer did not bring a list of lawyers to the accused's attention and the accused did not have access to it. The officer may not have drawn the presence of a telephone book to the accused's attention. The officer dialed the number for Legal Aid duty counsel for the accused and the accused spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel prior to providing breath samples of 190 milligrams and 180 milligrams. The accused never indicated that he wished to contact other counsel. HELD: Following a voir dire, the accused's application to exclude evidence was dismissed. The accused had not succeeded in establishing on a balance of probabilities that the accused's right to consult counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been violated. The accused was entirely disinterested in consulting with counsel as was his right and was clear and unequivocal in his waiver of rights to counsel. Alternatively, the accused failed to indicate a desire to exercise his right to counsel."
"The applicants have brought an application for writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, seeking unconditional release from the Riverbend Minimum Institution due to a threat to their respective liberties claiming the Correctional Service of Canada has violated their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in not allowing them to reside in a common housing unit so that they can participate in their long-standing, same-sex relationship outside of the public domain. HELD: 1) The applicants should have followed the grievance process on the issue of housing assignments. The applicants have been serving their 'life' or 'indeterminate' sentences at the Penitentiary and Sinobert has remained assessed as minimum security offender and has continued to be housed at minimum security Riverbender Institution. The Court assumes that neither of the applicants' situations have changed for the purpose of rendering this decision. Habeas corpus cannot be used to review the decision of the Correctional Services of Canada declining a housing reassignment request or the policy that all inmates found in their own will be subject to disciplinary charges. The true character of the remedies being sought by them is a writ of certioraris, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process. Thus, habeus corpus cannot review the way the Correctional service manages an inmate's sentence as is the case here. Hearsay: The applicants failed to establish any lawful ground for the application.  2) HELD-CURRENCY: The application was dismissed with costs to the Court in every event.","HELD: The Court dismissed the application. It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction. The applicants were trying to use habeas corpus when they actually were seeking a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies were available only through the Federal Court."
"The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning Canada Inc. (DOW). In 1990, she received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. In 1992, she had the breast implants removed. She now suffers from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a persistent immune mediated skin rash. The Court is of the view that the connection between the silicone implants and her condition was caused by negligence attributed to the manufacturers of the breast implant. HELD: The statement of claim was dismissed. The Plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs of the application in any event of the cause. 1)Dow Chemical was at law responsible for the liabilities of Dow Corring. The defendant was found to have breached its duty to disclose the risk inherent to the breast prostheses. There was also an allegation of link between the alleged failure to disclose and the plaintiff's injuries. 2)DOW Chemical was found liable for the breast cancer and its damages. There were allegations of negligence by the defendants in the manufacture of the implants and in the carrying-out of the task they were in reality one and the same entity. The plaintiff alleged that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of the defendant Corning Corporation should be treated as being those of the Dow Chemical Company. 3)The statement of claims did disclose wrongful conduct on the part of the defendants, the Dow chemical company and there was a causal connection between that conduct and the alleged damages suffered by the plaintiff.","FIAT. The plaintiff brought an action against five defendants claiming fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a skin rash were the result of silicone implants. One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96."
"The deceased's surviving spouse received a death benefit for herself and for her two children pursuant to the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. She took issue with the calculation of the death benefit, which was based on the percentage of her late husband's net income rather than on his gross income. SGI appealed the decision of the Queen's Bench Court. HELD: The death benefit was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the deceased's death benefit to her as a surviving spouse and her two dependent children in accordance with the directions of this Court. 1)The deceased was entitled to receive a lump sum payment of $603.25 per week for 14 days. 2)The definition of the income replacement benefit (IRB) in s.146(1) was not wrong. The only inconsistency in the legislation was that SGI did not define the IRB in s146(5) as it did in s145(1). SGI is not required to calculate any other form of income that might otherwise be payable to victim, such as deemed income for students who are unable to earn an income. Once the actual earnings are determined, net income is calculated and the deceased receives death benefit equal to 50% of that net income.","The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid."
The accused was convicted of dangerous driving causing death. He was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for 90 days. The defence argued that a sentence in the lower end of the range is one which should be imposed and that such a sentence should be a conditional sentence to be served in the community. HELD: 1)The Court of Appeal had not considered the question of whether it is appropriate that sentence of imprisonment be served within the community where the offence before the court was that of dangerous drive causing death (Criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle causing death); 2)The accused had consumed significant quantity of alcohol and was in no shape to drive vehicle. His actions were clearly inappropriate and imprudent and his consumption of alcohol appeared to be either the major cause of the fatality or contributing factor. The accused was fined $250.00 and had a blood alcohol level of.180. The Court sentenced him to 12 months less a day. 3)It was difficult to understand how the trauma of the accident could not have altered the accused's driving habits to prevent speeding. These convictions must be viewed as an aggravating circumstance requiring some emphasis on specific deterrence and rehabilitation.,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief."
"The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act which:(a)restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the petitioner and from his solicitors in relation to the respondent's claim in Queen's Bench Action No. Q.B.G. No. 2270/97, J.C. Regina (the 'Action'), pending the petitioner's application or further court order;(b)rests the respondent from disposing of any of the monies that he has received or may receive; and(d)restrorbs the respondent with any order respecting the assets of the respondent in respect to any claim under the Act.HELD: The respondent's personal claim for damages in the Action was the only one that might give him an ability to satisfy the claim under s77 of the Act that was made by the petitioner on behalf of herself and the children.  1)The respondent argued that a restraining order granted under s7 is a preservation of property order and should not be granted. 2)The Court reviewed the wording of s. 55 of The Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act and found that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent or equitable jurisdiction applies to an application under s8. The Act does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent has never had assets of significant value and the Court agreed that it has insufficient evidence upon which it could reasonably conclude that if the respondent acquired substantial funds that he would imprudently or improperly dispose of such funds or otherwise fail to use them to support his family. The only requirement is that the disposition or wasting of the asset would impair or defeat the Act under the application. 3)When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably become a source of satisfying a claim for the Act, the Act requires it to have some evidence of respondent's predilection or intention to waste assets. Here, the statute contains no such requirement and if the legislature had intended it as a precondition to the granting of this extraordinary remedy, it could easily have done so by express language as it is in other statutes.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action. The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose."
"The appellant appealed his conviction of operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255 and 253 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge misdirected herself in finding that there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant's ability to operate a motor Vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The learned trial judge drew an incorrect inference from the facts at trial in finding the appellant had the care or control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The appellant's findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment by alcohol are supported by the evidence. Direct evidence confirms that the accused's condition did not change for the period that he was in the driver's seat and if impairment is indeed proven, then it applies equally to when he was first observed in the vehicle as to later observed in it. Clearly impairment of ability to drive is an issue of fact to be found on all the evidence before the Court and must satisfy the Court beyond reasonable doubt. The inference made by the trial judge is one that a properly instructed jury could have arrived at on the facts in the instant case and therefore should not be interfered with.","An appeal of conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (Criminal Code s.255 and s.253) on the grounds of misdirection in finding there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to impairment; an incorrect inference and failure to give correct legal effect to the facts as found including the lack of evidence of impairment at the material time while he was in care or control of the vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence. Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence. The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.  2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838). However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba). A properly instructed jury could have arrived at the same inference on the facts as found."
"FIAT: The parties reached an impasse on the required disclosure and sought various orders. The defendants sought an order for the Court to exercise its discretion and sever the plaintiffs' claim between liability and damages. The plaintiffs seek an order that certain paragraphs of the plaintiffs’ claim be struck. HELD: The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants’ obligation to maintain this confidence and the defendants could be liable to the accounting firm should it breach that confidentiality.  1) The court reviewed the relevant case law and found that the plaintiffs had developed their own SR&ED application process by cultivating relationships with accounting firms, industry associations, post-secondary learning institutions and various business organizations. The defendant denied the plaintiffs have a proprietary right in that application process. 2) The Court reviewed the applicable Queen’s Bench Rules and found there was no order as to costs.  3) The defendants were granted their application to have the claim severed so that the threshold point of liability could be tried prior to requiring the defendants to disclose and be discovered on the issue of damages. 4) The defendant argued that the delay in full disclosure of material pertaining to damages makes little difference. Both parties know the profitability of the company. The risks that must be weighed in considering settlement pertain to liability. Those risks have not changed by granting the defendants their application. 5) Although other common law provinces have specific rules addressing the withholding of disclosure until after an issue has been determined, our court has found that such authority now rests with our inherent jurisdiction.  6) The Alberta Court considered the application under its Rules of Court pertaining to the contents of the defendant’ affidavit of documents. The court found that bifurcation of the liability and damage issues would lead to further motions if the parties could not agree on the characterization of the documents or questions in discovery.","FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract."
"FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. The defendants entered into a mortgage with the plaintiff in April 2005 for land described as 'Lot 4, Block 17, Plan No. 85SC07177, Extension 0, Burstall. The mortgage was renewed for a year period with a maturity date of March 14, 2008. The plaintiff applied ex parte for an appointment for hearing of an application pursuant to the Act for leave to commence an action. This was not in compliance with s. 3(2) of the Act which prescribes that an application may be brought after the expiration of 30 clear days from the date of service on the Provincial Mediation Board. HELD: The application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for six months, and on the basis that there is no sale to be confirmed based on the evidence filed. On a renewed application for confirm of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the court any offers received. There was no order from the court authorizing pre-leave costs nor any evidence as to why the court might consider pre- leave costs.","FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received. There will be no costs awarded for this unsuccessful application."
"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and use or threatened use of weapon. The police had been aware that the accused had not been cooperative witness to them since the assault. The accused had made three statements during the course of his detention, one of which was that he wished to have legal counsel now. The Crown sought admission of the other statements made by the accused during the detention, alleging that he wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial. The defence argued that the officer had been advised of his right to counsel without delay and that he should have taken more time to make that decision. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. The court found that the trial judge's remarks concerning the 'time out' component of the Charter did not indicate a state of disrepute. The Court found that this was a different situation than those involving guns and narcotics. This was an absolute fundamental right to get advice from counsel before making a statement to the police. Access to counsel is the gateway of Charter rights particularly in these circumstances where this statement is the only evidence to be offered by the Crown in seeking conviction. It would be egregious to allow admission of this videotaped statement into evidence.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault, use of a weapon, unlawful possession of a weapon and breach of a recognizance. The admissibility of the accused's videotaped statement was at issue with regard to his capacity to understand the Charter caution given by the police. When asked if he wished to contact a lawyer, the accused had responded in the negative, noting that there would 'probably be one down around there anyway.' statement excluded from evidence; the accused's s. 10(b) rights had been violated. It was clear that the accused was confused and not focused on the present and that his mind had wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial as opposed to his immediate right to have counsel. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty that the officer should have made an effort to clarify the informational component of the right to counsel."
"The accused was charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window and with aggravated assault. The major issue for the Court was whether the accused could be convicted of both the charge of mischief and aggravated assault or whether she should have been convicted of one of the lesser and included offences. HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of both charges. The Court stated that the Crown has not proved the requisite intent to sustain convictions under s. 267 or s. 268 of the Criminal Code. As far back as the case of R. v. Lepaskowski, [1960] S.C.R. 871, the Court held that when an individual intentionally strikes another in the facial area with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. It is simply not believable that these kind of injuries could have been inflicted by a single backhanded blow. The injuries were inflicted by blow from the candle holder.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date."
"The appellant was convicted of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction. Corrigendum received dated March 6, 2015 and added to fulltext. HELD: 1) The trial judge erred in finding that the appellant rebutted the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) of Criminal Code that the person who occupies the driver's seat is deemed to have care and control of the vehicle. He found that the accused rebutched the presumption by definition that the officer who occupies a driver's position is deemed as having care and Control. He adopted the reasoning of Green P.C.J. who found that although the appellant was planning on resting and sleeping for a number of hours before driving to Manitoba, he did not occupy the driver’s seat for the purpose of setting his vehicle in motion. 2) The evidence at the third trial was conclusive that the respondent rebutled the presumption that the individual who occupies or acts in the driver-s seat is considered to have 'care and control' of the Vehicle. The trial court found that even if he was wrong in concluding that the trial judge rebutting the presumption so as to rebut the presumption of accuracy, he had no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial. 3) The Court reviewed the relevant factors and found that, in the circumstances of the case, the appellant had care and controlled of the car. The only thing that affected the decision was the appellant’ s. 813 decision. The appellant rebuking the presumption and rebuting the conclusion that the 2008 amendments to s258(1(c)(iii) were retrospective and as such, applied to this charge. The accused rebuked the presumption, just barely, that the defendant was in actual care or Control. The evidence, including the Intoxilizer results and the results of the roadside testing, was sufficient to conclude he was in care or controlling of the motor vehicle at the time of the offence. 4) The appellant was simply mistaken as to his amount of alcohol consumed that day or was deliberately misleading the Court in an attempt to defeat this charge, for these reasons do not accept his evidence as to consumption and do not find it to be capable of evidence to the contrary. 5) The only conclusion drawn","The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings."
"The appellant, who had pled guilty to seven counts of break, enter and theft into dwelling houses, appealed from the 56-month prison sentence he was sentenced to eight months for the first two offences. He argued that the sentences were harsh and excessive, and alleged that the co-accused had virtually no record, one breach of an undertaking when he was a youth. Dismissing the appeal, that although the appellant was three and a half years younger, he had no record to speak of at all, there was more in his case to justify deterrence than he did.","22 year old male pled guilty to seven counts of break, enter and theft - prior criminal record of nine convictions, including four break and enters -  co-accused sentenced to three months for each count totalling 21 months  -  eight months on each count for a total of 56 months upheld on appeal  -  the trial judge properly considered that the appellant pled guilty, the extent of his cooperation with police, the presentence report, remorse, rehabilitation, whether the sentences should be consecutive or concurrent, his reasons for making them consecutive, the principles of totality, deterrence, and other relevant factors - the co-accused was three and one half years younger with no record and was not the ringleader."
"This was an appeal from a judgment under The Matrimonial Property Act which dealt with whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated. HELD: The appeal was allowed to the extent referred to in the disposition. 1)The judge used the only value put in evidence, the appropriate credit given to the husband according to which items each of the parties, in the end, received and the judgment was varied accordingly. 2)The court overlooked or failed to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give the husband credit for his one-half share of them.","Appeal from 107 SaskR 135, 44 RFL(3d)185. Appeal from a judgment directing matrimonial property. The main issue was whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated. The couple's marriage had lasted less than four years. HELD: The QB judgment was upheld regarding the severance package. The severance package was not a reward for past service; it was for payment in lieu of reasonable notice of termination. The severance package was based on future earnings, which would have occurred within the duration of the marriage. The QB judge did however fail to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give the husband his one-half share of them. Judgment varied accordingly."
"The defendant appealed a jury trial decision awarding damages for personal injuries and loss sustained in an automobile collision. The trial judge limited the amount of expert opinion evidence available to the jury as a result of the plaintiff's injuries. She argued that the trial judge erred in law in failing to caution the jury regarding the weight to be given evidence of Douglas Kalesnikoff. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)Since liability was admitted by the defendant the trial was limited to assessment of damages by the jury. The Court rejected the appellant's contention that the admission of the tabulation and explanation of it by the appellant resulted in any miscarriage of justice. 2)The award for impaired earning capacity was so inordinately high that it was perverse, wholly out of all proportion, unsupported by the evidence and unreasonable. 3)The plaintiff was not seeking to avoid the presentation of argument through the mouth of this witness and relied on the evidence of an expert forensic accountant.","The Appellant/Defendant, Bennett appealed a judgment resulting from a jury trial. At trial, the Plaintiff had been awarded damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendant limited her appeal to the amount awarded for future loss of earnings. The Respondent/Plaintiff cross-appealed on the issue of whether the trial judge should have directed the jury to deduct sick leave benefits from her past loss of income. Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed."
"The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as driver and driver's helper for 28 years. He claimed that his breaks and breaks were for his meal and were part of a 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The defendant dismissed the plaintiff from his employment without notice. The plaintiff claimed that he was entitled to longer breaks and a 40 minute break for lunch. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's dismissal was justified because he failed to follow company policy with respect to breaks and overtime. Awarding the plaintiff $15 for an hour of break and $5 for lunch, the plaintiff claimed he was not entitled to any breaks during the day because he had been working overtime. He argued that he had not been properly warned of the potential for discipline and retaliation. Dismissing the action, that the defendant company has satisfied the onus on them to prove that there was a just cause for the dismissal of the plaintiff.","This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff had worked for 28 years for the defendant as a driver making deliveries to customers. The defendant dismissed the plaintiff for 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The plaintiff had taken longer coffee and lunch breaks than were allowed, and had taken unauthorized breaks for which he had then been paid overtime by the defendant. For the defendant, that the dismissal was justified. The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules."
"The appellant was convicted of break and enter and theft of lobsters from a lobster car situate at Metaghan wharf. The trial judge agreed with Crown counsel that the conversation should not be admitted into evidence because of an alleged inducement. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. At issue was whether the trial judge erred in admitting into evidence a statement by the appellant to an RCMP constable without holding a voir dire. Dismissing the appeal, setting aside the conviction and ordering a NEW trial, that the evidence of the Crown witnesses and the axe found in the water had not been misconstrued as being voluntary.","Where on a charge of break, enter and theft, the trial judge agreed with the Crown that a conversation between a police officer and the appellant was inadmissible, but then effectively allowed the evidence by permitting the testimony of the police officer, and no voir dire had been held to determine if the conversation was admissible. The appeal against conviction was allowed and a new trial ordered."
"The applicant sought an interim injunction until trial or until a further order on certain terms and conditions. HELD: The application was granted. An interim injunction was granted against the defendants and any person acting under their instruction or behest and members of said Unions. The conditions imposed were that the persons picketing should remain in motion, that the application be allowed in an orderly manner, that no one should disturb the lawful lawful operation of the premises, and that there was no danger to the public. The applicant raised a substantial question to be tried. It established a prima facie case of the violation by the defendants of a right that the applicant might have. There was a balance of convenience in the matter.","The City applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the Defendant Unions from engaging in unlawful picketing. The City alleged that the members of the Defendant Unions obstructed and/or blocked entrances to and/or exits from various premises of the plaintiff including, inter alia, its Electrical Distribution Department, its Water and Pollution Control Department and its Water Treatment Plant thereby interfering with the plaintiff's statutory and contractual obligations to provide essential services to its citizens and others, and, as well, created a danger to the health and safety of its said citizens and others. The Defendant Unions did not file any materials. HELD: Application allowed. On the whole of the evidence the court was satisfied that the applicant had raised a substantial question to be tried, had established a prima facie case, was in danger of suffering injury which could not adequately be compensated for by the award of damages in money, and that the balance of convenience in the matter favoured the applicant."
"FIAT. The bankrupt and husband of the bankrupt applied for costs of the abortive examination. Prior to the taxation proceeding, a preliminary issue was raised by counsel for S.E.D.C.O. concerning the interpretation of Rule 566 (o) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. HELD: 1)Since the examination of the Mrs. Kolody is not concluded, there may be further applications to the court which could affect the issue of costs as it relates to the wife. 2)The taxation was to be ordered as soon as the examination was concluded. It was clear from these reasons that it was time to have the taxation proceed. 3)Costs were to be taxed at a rate of $50 per day for three days.","The bankrupt's wife was examined by SEDCO, pursuant to s. 163 of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. Following the abortive examination, she was awarded taxable costs. Prior to the taxation proceeding, SECDO raised an issue with respect to s. 566(o) of the Queen's Bench Rules, arguing that the costs referred to were awarded in interlocutory proceedings an should not be taxed until the final determination of the action. HELD: The Court held that since the examination was ongoing, there could be further applications to the Court that would affect the issue of costs. The taxation was ordered to occur after the examination was concluded."
"The Department was requesting a permanent order pursuant to s. 37(2) of The Child and Family Services Act. The foster parents had cared for the four and one-half year old for nearly 3 years with the assistance of parent aide [F.S]. The father was abusive and physically abusive to the mother and to the child. The mother was found to have ADD/ADD disorders and the child was placed in the custody of the Minister until the age of 18 years. HELD: The child was in need of protection and the natural parents were unable to care for her particularly given her special needs. The child remained in the foster home and was placed with the Minister. 1)The natural parents, [L.C.] and [J.C.], were committed to the Child and were committed by their marriage to thechild. However, they love the child like our own and would not take in any other foster children as long as they had the child; it was in the child's best interest to remain with the Child's parents and to continue to have visits with her natural parents. 2)The child was exposed to severe emotional harm and the foster parents were incapable of providing for her needs. HARD: It was in Child and Child Services' best interest that the child remain in the [P.] foster home until the time of 18 year. 3)The children were in need a permanent protection order and it was also in the Child & Family Services' interest to continue with her visits with natural parents given the child had special needs resulting from the attention deficit hyperactive disorder and her special diagnosis.","The Department of Social Services requested a permanent custody order for a four and one-half year child pursuant to s37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act. The parents sought custody, or alternatively, to have the child remain with the present foster family. HELD: The child was placed in the custody of the Minister until the age of 18 years. It was strongly recommended that she remain in the foster parents' home where she had been for three years. The natural parents were to have reasonable access. 1)The child was in need of protection. The parents were unable to provide for all her needs even with the considerable assistance from the Department. She was exposed to severe domestic disharmony which could have resulted in emotional harm. The natural parents' ability to provide for her needs had not improved significantly. The child's special needs resulting from attention deficit disorder required enormous amounts of care and attention on a daily basis. 2)It was in the child's best interests to remain where she was and to continue to have contact with her natural parents."
"The appellant appealed its acquittal on a charge that it sold tobacco or a tobacco product to a person under the age of 19 years contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act. The issues at trial involved the constitutionality of the Act and the defence of due diligence. The trial judge found that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, S.C. 13, that it 'cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation', and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. Having found the legislation to be unconstitutional, an acquittal was entered. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the matter of the trial judge's finding, that he erred in finding the provincial Statute unconstitutional. The proper method of analysis in this case has three steps. First, it is necessary to determine the matter, or the 'pith and substance' of each of the federal and provincial laws. We are satisfied that the Province's tobacco access act is legislation in relation to the health of young persons. As for federal legislation, the doctrine of respondeat superior has no application. Where an employer is charged in respect of an act committed by an employee acting in the course of employment, the question will be whether the act took place without the accused's direction or approval... and whether the accused exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent commission and by taking reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system.","The respondent grocery store was charged with selling tobacco to a person under the age of 19, contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act. The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial. The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province. He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. The trial judge further commented that, had the Act been constitutional, he would have convicted because he did not accept the accused's defence of due diligence. The Crown appealed, and the accused cross-appealed. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial, that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction. It does not conflict with the federal Tobacco Act. The trial judge therefore erred in finding that the Tobacco Access Act was ultra vires. The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence. The question is not, as the trial judge thought, whether the employee who sold the tobacco was duly diligent, but whether the accused, her employer, exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent the commission of the offence, and by taking all reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system."
"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be reserved on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now shows that substantial offers were made through counsel, although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The applicant argues that the Court needed to know the full extent of the estate so as to properly determine the applicant's entitlement to the estate. HELD: 1) The applicant failed to demonstrate that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance based on the needs-based approach. The respondent submits that the total recovery of $230,000 is close to the offer of $250,000 made in September of 1996. In the alternative, the applicant asks for fixed award of costs in order to avoid taxation.  2) In fixing an amount, the Court is faced with two equally untenable positions in determining costs. If the costs of the litigation were to be paid out of the award, the remainder may be insufficient to meet Jade's anticipated needs. This is not an appropriate case in which to order full solicitor & client costs. In this situation, however, it is appropriate for the Court to fix the costs to the applicant in lump sum.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements."
"The sole issue before the court was whether any additional dependant child care benefits were payable under s. 146(5) of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act when the deceased victim was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The children were not entitled to any additional benefits. The sole issue on appeal was whether these extra dependant benefits were available under s146(5). The deceased was not entitled in 1998 to any extra benefits and had been unemployed for 6 months prior to the accident. She was not employed and would not have become entitled to an income within six months if she had survived. As there was no surviving spouse the children were entitled to death benefit under s145(5), which was the amount payable as death benefit. The appeal was dismissed without any order as to costs.","SGI paid $47,427, the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, to the guardian of the three infant children of the deceased single mother. The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident. Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854. The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs. Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5). It is the total amount payable as a death benefit. The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero. Where no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s.146(3), no further amount is payable under either s.146(5) or s.147(5)."
"The applicants were the owners of two horses involved in a $15,000stakes race that comprised the sixth race on that day's race card and featured a field of eight horses. The horse that won the race was disqualified for interference at the gate. The applicants applied for judicial review alleging that the Liquor and Gaming Commission had exceeded its jurisdiction by Overturning the Stewards' Decision to Disqualify the Horse. HELD: The application was allowed. The matter was remitted back to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices were given to the applicants. 1)The applicants are the owners and the costs of their application are denied. 2)The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record. The decision of the Commission is patently unreasonable. 3)The respondents failed to give adequate or any notice of the hearing. The decisions of the commissioners and the Labour Court rests on an interpretation of s.32 L.C. (Natural justice standard) which is not patently unfair.","An application for a judicial review of a decision by the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Commission which held that the veering to the left by the two horses was within the tolerance of interference at the gate for two year olds. The Commission overturned the decision of the stewards and restored the horse declared to be in first place. In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed. The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record. The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.  3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence. The stewards were not vested with the sole authority to determine whether there was interference at the gate. 4)Knight v. Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual. 5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions. The decision of the Commission to refuse to give the applicants notice of the hearing was patently unreasonable. Their rights were affected by the decision. Bibeault was distinguishable. 6)The applicants were awarded costs."
"The accused was charged with criminal negligence causing death contrary to s.220 of the Criminal Code and unlawfully care or control of a motor vehicle while her ability to operate was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to ss.255(3) of the Code. The accused's testimony was adduced during voir dire hearing. HELD: The accused was acquitted. 1)The evidence did not support a conviction on the first count of the information. Since there was no evidence at the trial to prove the fact assumed, the expert evidence of extrapolation had no probative value. 2)The accused's evidence regarding the blood alcohol level of the victim was found to be in error. 3)The blood alcohol content of the accused's body at the time of the motor vehicle accident was at the equivalent of 216 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.  4)No medical evidence was obtained as a result of the accident. The blood alcohol reading at 12:10, 12:15, and 12:20 was accurate. 5)The only conclusion that was drawn was that the accused was not impaired was in the presence of alcohol during the time she was incapacitated by the alcohol.  6)The court was unable to determine whether the accused’s condition related to the death of the other two counts.","The accused was charged with impaired driving causing bodily harm. Expert evidence was given based on blood samples taken after the accident that the accused was impaired; this opinion was based on two assumptions, namely, that the accused had not consumed alcohol within half an hour of the accident, nor after the accident. The Crown did not offer any evidence to prove these assumptions and, in fact, there was a three hour period prior to the accident where there was no evidence of what the accused, who did not testify, was doing. Acquitting the accused, that the expert evidence cannot be tendered by the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had been impaired. The remainder of the evidence against the accused was insufficient to prove the accused's doubt beyond a reasonable doubt."
"The Agency applied for permanent care of four children. The Agency found that the three children were in need of protective services and that the mother, who was the principle caregiver, was neglectful and using corporal punishment as a method of disciplining them. The children had been out of their mother's care for approximately one-half of their short lifetime. As the mother had recently given birth, the Agency had made a referral to Children's Aid to assess the children's physical and mental health, the risk to the children caused by the failure of the parent to supervise adequately was high, and the agency was prepared to increase the number of access visits. The mother was to participate in a parental capacity assessment and psychological assessment as soon as possible. Children placed in the temporary care of the Agency with access to both the Agency and the Agency. An assessment was held in April 2002 and the matter was adjourned to May 2003 for a Disposition Hearing. Counsel for the Agency advised the Court that a finding of this nature would be entered under 22(2)(b) pursuant to s40(3) of the Child Stress and Substantive Abuse Test and a general costing clause was included in the general costing.","The Agency applied for the permanent care of four young children, aged 2 to 5 years. The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met. The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them. Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional. Neither parent could, nor wished to, change in the foreseeable future."
"The accused made an application under s. 515 of the Criminal Code and ss. 33 (8) and 13(2) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act for interim judicial release pending his preliminary inquiry. The Provincial Court declined the accused's application on the grounds that he's presence in the community awaiting trial would erode the public's confidence in the administration of justice. The Crown asked for a determination of two preliminary issues: 1) whether the Youth Court judge in the Provincial Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the application for judicial interim release; and 2) if so, whether this honourable court has jurisdiction to conduct review. The issue then becomes for a young person charged with murder who is charged with second degree murder. HELD: The jurisdiction for the determination of interim judicial disclosure rests solely with the superior court of criminal jurisdiction which in the Province of Saskatchewan is the Court of Queen's Bench; and the youth justice court shall hear the matter as an original application. There was no similar provision in the Young Offender's Act.","The accused made an application to the Court of Queen's Bench under s. 515 of the Criminal Code and s. 33(8) and s. 13(2) of The Youth Criminal Justice Act for interim judicial release of the accused pending his preliminary inquiry on a charge of murder. The accused had previously applied to a Provincial Court judge, who had declined the accused's application. The issue was whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused's application for judicial interim release. HELD: The jurisdiction for determination of interim judicial release of a young person charged with murder under the Youth Criminal Justice Act rests solely with the superior court of criminal jurisdiction, which is the Court of Queen's Bench in Saskatchewan."
"The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree that the appellant is defined by the Act as a non-earner who was involved in a motor vehicle accident in July 1998 and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as skidder operator. HELD: The appellant is entitled to solicitor-client costs. 1) The Act provides for calculation of IRB for the first 180 days and for the 181st and subsequent days. 2) The legislation strives for one's earning reality. Non-earners in the past may well become someone whose employment income, but for the accident, would be more than the 'weighted average approach'. 3) The earning reality of the appellant was working for employment income no more than half the time. He would have worked, on average, 90 of the 180 days. The reduction in the period of employment be reduced to factor in inclement weather is not required. 4) The issue is determining the time that Montgrand would have actually been employed and that finding has been made. If it is greater, Montgrand has the benefit provided by s. 117(4). 5) SGI submits that the weighted average approach in calculating Montgrand's gross yearly employment income (GYEI) sets the IRB much lower. The ratio in Dietner is not relevant. Section 117 and the corresponding regulations provide the mathematical formula to determine the value of the applicant's IRB and the GYEI from which it is derived.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle. There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3) Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101."
"The parties shared joint custody of the three children of the marriage. The primary residence was with the mother. The parties did not seek periodic or lump sum support but rather a lump sum payment to cover tuition at the Atlantic School of Theology. The mother opposed the payment of spousal support but sought authorization to obtain passports. The father was to pay child support of $986 per month. Joint custody awarded to the mother with access to the children every second weekend. The matrimonial home was clearly a matrimony asset and must be divided equally. The parents had been extensively involved in the operation of the property since marriage and the children's best interests were served by remaining in the matrimonium home with their mother. Although the mother had visited the family home several times during the marriage, she never took any steps to prevent the property from being a family venture. The children enjoyed considerable financial support from their father, who was a successful businessman. Although his income from his businesses was not disclosed, the fact that the mother spent much of the time and money on the home did not disqualify her from receiving support.","The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset."
"The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along the community's highway. His driver's license was revoked and he was charged with driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his license was revved. At the time his driver's licence was revoked, he was convicted of driving a vehicle on a highway while revoked, which was the charge before the court. The defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2) do not include an ATV and even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an ATT on the road. The words 'all terrain vehicle' are used within the words of s. Motor Vehicle Act to determine whether the provision applies to the use of ATV's or other prohibited vehicles. The use of an ATX on public highways is clearly prohibited under the Motor Vehicle act. The accused could not have obtained a license to drive the ATV on the highways because it was a prohibited vehicle and it was vehicle of the wrong type or class to get license.","The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was revoked when he was found operating an all terrain vehicle (ATV) on a highway. Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway."
"The mother applied to vary the father's maintenance for her daughters, Nicole and Kirsti. She also applied for determination that the daughters were no longer children of the marriage, and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. The father in turn applied for a finding that the daughter was in arrears of maintenance, and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education. The daughter's father, who was an airline pilot, moved to Hong Kong where he resided with his new wife while the daughters lived with his mother. Pursuant to an inter-spousal agreement, the father was to pay child support in the amount of $450 per month for each child and among other things, he would maintain a scholarship fund for the daughters until they were 18. The mother failed to make any further efforts to contact the father. The trial judge found that this was not a situation where a unilateral withdrawal by the daughters was necessary and it was not reasonable to require the father to pay more. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court found that the trial judge made no palpable or overriding error in his finding the father is not in deficit of child support and that there was no order for retroactive maintenance. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship. The quality of the parent/child relationship by itself rarely determines the issue. The case law indicates that the threshold is high for finding that a child's termination of a relationship with the parent is determinative of the child's status and entitlement to maintenance. Even if the circumstances as a whole were construed as a unilateral withdraw by the daughter, the high threshold for a determination that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met."
"The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident. He contended the information was nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The matter was remitted to the trial judge in order to be concluded. 1) The trial judge did not pursue his argument that the information is nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 700(2 of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the judge should have dealt only with that count. An apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. 2) The Court of Appeal did not grant the application to quash as being nullity. It held that the Chambers judge was rightly bound to follow the normal course of justice and did not err in his approach to the information.","The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident. He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count.

This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial. No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information."
"The plaintiff claims his personal and professional reputation has been seriously damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. The plaintiff took four years post-graduate course in Illinois and received a Master of Science in 1984. He started work at the University of Saskatchewan as an assistant professor. He received his full professorship in 1991 and was appointed director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) in 2002. The VTH is a full-service animal hospital open to members of the public, operating both a large animal clinic and small animal clinic. In the fall of 2006, the plaintiff filed a grievance with the university alleging that he was being harassed and, since then, he has been an active participant of the harassment himself. The impugned words accused the director of refusing to prevent harassment and of taking an active part in the harassment of the female employee. HELD: The plaintiff has proven he was defamed. The defendants have accepted the defendants' defence of qualified privilege. 1) There is no basis for jurisdictional defence. 2) The Court reviewed the history of the grievance and found it did not constitute intentional interference with the workplace. Jurisdiction is one of strict liability. 3) The plaintiff was found to have been defamed by the wording of the VTH grievance and the defendants had failed in their duty to ensure that the plaintiff was able to return to a safe workplace environment. The Court found the plaintiff's reputation was seriously damaged and awarded him judgment for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary and employee duty.","The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs."
"FIAT: The court has ruled on the substantive aspect of the application in separate fiat and rendered my decision in respect of the admissibility of some of the evidence the respondent put before the court. HELD: The application at bar is another salvo in a bitter custody and access dispute. Settlement negotiations are protected by settlement privilege which is a jointly held privilege that cannot be waived by any one party acting alone. This privilege is fundamental to the policy interest of promoting settlement discussions as means to avoiding trial. It should only be set aside if there is a very compelling, competing policy warranting such a waiver. As settlement communications are almost always irrelevant to the issues that are properly considered by the Court, it is rare that there will be any competing policy or, indeed, any reason to reference them at all. This is gamesmanship and nothing more.",The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their children. The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner. The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal. HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it. The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it. The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.
The applicant Government of Saskatchewan has brought a motion before myself as trial judge for an order permitting a live audio/video broadcast of the trial set to proceed in April 2013 from a Court of Queen's Bench courtroom in Saskatoon to a courtroom in a court house in the Greater Toronto area for the exclusive benefit of the family of the deceased. The respondent has consented to the draft order filed by the applicant and the respondent. HELD: The application is dismissed. The court is very concerned about the possible ramifications of granting an order allowing video conferencing throughout the country for the benefit of multiple parties. This is a dangerous precedent and one that would be dangerous to the administration of justice.,"The applicant, the Government of Saskatchewan Victim Services Branch requested an order permitting a live audio broadcast of the trial of the accused from a courtroom in Saskatoon to a courtroom in Toronto for the exclusive benefit of the family of the deceased victim. The accused took no position. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. Making an order for video-conferencing for non- participating persons was not permitted because the Court had no control over the policing of the courtroom in Ontario. It would set a dangerous precedent that could result in multiple applications being made in future trials by numerous interested parties in different jurisdictions over which the Court had no control."
"The applicant asks that the registration of mortgage against land be discharged on the basis that the limitation period to enforce the mortgage has expired. The respondent says the limitation time has not expired because The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, 1988-89, c. S-17.1 provides for a suspension of limitation time running while certain proceedings are underway pursuant to that Farm Security act. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1) The Court found that the application to discharge s. 22 of the Farm SecurityAct as set out in s. 11(1) of the Limitations Act did not have an expiration date. 2) The application to continue the limitation by way of s. 12(16) was deemed to have expired. 3) The applicant was entitled to the costs of her application against the respondent.","Limitation of Actions – Mortgage – Saskatchewan Farmland SecurityHELD: When s. 12 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act was enacted it was the legislature’s intention that a mortgagee, to whom The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act applied, could suspend the limitation period clock from running and after serving a notice of intention to enforce its security, provided that within three years of such service the mortgagee made application to the court for an order under s. 11 permitting it to commence an enforcement action. If the three years for making such an application expires without an application being made, the limitation period begins to run again. The notice of extension in this case expired in 2009 and the limitation clock began to run again. The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce the respondent’s mortgage has expired and the registration of the mortgage is ordered discharged."
"The respondent applies for an order to discontinue his obligation to pay child support and spousal support and for all support arrears to be expunged. He relies upon s. 17 of the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, and s. 14 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. HELD: 1) The original order was correct. The matter did not proceed beyond the interim stage. Rather, from April 2005 through to the present, the respondent has been content to have the existing order in place and did not seek to challenge it by way of trial proceedings to obtain a final order different from that pronounced by McIntyre J. 2) The respondent is able to establish he has been working full-time employment for the past four years. In those years, he earned actual income from full time position. There is little doubt it will be onerous for him but then, on the other hand, he has avoided paying anything for considerable period of time. In the result, am not prepared to expunge any of the arreears prior to 2013. 3) The Court must consider whether the original Order was correct at the time it was made. The present income is $88,808.88 per annum. This is a consistent income for several years. The respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made 10 years ago. It is not complete answer to the determination of an appropriate historical income for the respondent. The obligation does not lie on the petitioner to show why the imputed income is still appropriate. The onus rests squarely on the respondent to justify the need for change. He must present evidence of changed circumstances which establish that either a) it is no longer necessary or appropriate to impute income, (i.e. that he is unable to continue with the manufacture of the invention, and (ii) he is unlikely to be able to continue to earn consistent income in the future. While there is nothing to explain what has changed, the onus lies with the respondent, who is prepared to pay his proportionate share of post-secondary education costs. It appears he was not able to find employment in his chosen field, because he was working, and because he had avoided providing any meaningful financial support to his children and former spouse for the entire time the order has been in place.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made in 2005. The court assumed that the imputation was correct. The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them. The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income."
"This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's claim that the respondent conspired with her sister and brother-in-law to have the seasonal dwelling owned by the four respondents intentionally burned. The appellant claimed payment of $20,000 plus expenses associated with investigating and adjusting the loss. The respondent's insurer appealed the decision. Appeal dismissed; the appellant did not commit a fraud in obtaining payment under the insurance policy; she made no wilful false statement. The failure of the appellant to disclose the sister's testimony to the insurer in the face of her uncertainty whether or not she had arranged the fire was not fraud. The insurer relied in its factum on the statutory conditions as basis for its claim. The appeal was dismissed with costs of $1,200.","The appellant insurer appealed a decision dismissing its claim that the respondent conspired with her sister and brother-in-law to have her cottage intentionally burned. The appellant asserted the respondent acted fraudulently by failing to make full disclosure of the facts surrounding the cause of loss. Dismissing the appeal, that the respondent did not wilfully make any false statement, and answered all questions as required on the documents provided. Her silence in the face of uncertainty over her in-laws involvement in the fire did not constitute fraud. If the appellant expects an insured to comply with statutory conditions, it must reproduce them in the policy and provide a question on the proof of loss form to that effect."
"This was an application by the Applicant for an order in the nature of Habeas Corpus and an order for certiorari in aid. Dismissing the application, that there was evidence before the trial judge upon which a jury, properly instructed and acting judicially could convict the accused of first degree murder. The evidence before this trial was conclusive that the accused aided or abetted the accused in committing the offence charged.","This was an application for an Order in the nature of Habeas Corpus and Certiorari in aid. The applicant had been charged with the first degree murder of her estranged husband. The judge at preliminary inquiry concluded that there was evidence adduced that the accused had paid money to the man who had killed the victim the day after the killing, that she was involved in cleaning the apartment where the killing took place after the body was removed, and that the accused and the man who killed the victim had discussed the matter prior to the event, and thus there was sufficient evidence upon which a 'properly instructed jury may find...[the accused] guilty...' The appellant contended that the judge had applied the wrong test for committal. Dismissing the application, that the question is not whether the judge correctly verbalized the test, but rather if the evidence supported the committal, and there was, indeed, enough circumstantial evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed and acting reasonably in accordance with those instructions, could convict the accused of first degree murder."
"The applicant school board sought a declaration that the Province was responsible to provide school buildings required for the delivery of a basic Public School Program. Included in the fifty-five schools are six school buildings leased by the Cape Breton Board from the Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Antigonish or other entities of the Roman Catholic Church. It is the responsibility for payment of the leasing cost on these buildings that is now before the Court. The issue is whether the Minister of Education (the 'Minister') is required to reimburse the board for the costs incurred by the board in leasing these buildings from the Church. The Court found that, because of the failure to follow the Education Act, the Province is not required to pay the cost of these leases.","The applicant sought a declaration that the province was responsible for providing school buildings for delivery of the public school program and that when buildings must be leased, the province bore the associated costs. The applicant, which leased six school buildings from the Roman Catholic Church, submitted the respondent was required to reimburse the applicant for leasing costs. For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs. Where the Minister received a request in the proper form and where it was determined leases were necessary, the leasing costs would be the respondent's responsibility."
"FIAT. The mother sought child support for the child. The father was to pay child support of $160 per month. HELD: The child was to be provided with $1,010 per month after he had paid his income tax, Canada Pension Plan and Unemployment Insurance contributions. 1)The public purse must continue to bear most of his support obligation. There was an interim order that the father paychild support of 160.00 per month commencing November 15, 1995. 2)The father must be permitted to retain enough of his income to provide a subsistence living for himself.","FIAT The applicant (mother) sought child support. She was on social assistance and the father's income including rental income was $1,623.00 per month. HELD: An order for interim support at $160.00 per month. There wasn't enough money to go around. The father must be permitted to retain enough of his income to provide a subsistence living for himself."
"Decision in mortgage loss suit. The plaintiff had purchased two insurance policies for the purpose of indemnifying her against one insured company for non-payment of the insurance premium. The defendant failed to disclose the policy to the plaintiff and the insurer of the property. When the property was totally destroyed by fire in 1992, the plaintiff, who had been advised of the possible loss, refused to foreclose. She sought solicitor to act on her behalf. Awarding the plaintiff $200,000 for the loss of the other insurance policy, that under the terms of the arrangement the plaintiff should not be denied coverage on the basis of errors made by the insurer, the standard of proof was still on balance of probabilities but on a higher degree of probability, commensurate with the conduct alleged. The court accepted the plaintiff's submission that the insurance policies were in place for the protection of the plaintiff company and that they had been 'underwritten by and for the insured by' by the defendant.","The plaintiff held a mortgage on a house destroyed by a suspicious fire. At the time of the fire there were two insurance policies in place for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff. One was placed by the mortgagors with the defendant to protect both their interests and those of the plaintiff. When the defendant notified the plaintiff that it was going to cancel the policy, the plaintiff placed a second policy on the property. The fire occurred less than a day before the first policy was to be cancelled. The defendant refused to honour the policy. It claimed that the formal Proof of Loss filed by the plaintiff was fraudulent, as it failed to disclose the existence of the second policy. Finding for the plaintiff, that the defendant has not satisfied the heavy burden of producing clear and satisfactory evidence that the plaintiff, through its employees, acted wilfully and knowingly to claim the benefit of coverage to which it was not entitled."
"This was an application for an order setting aside a default judgment entered against the defendant municipality in February 1996. The plaintiff had filed an affidavit claiming that a mudslide had occurred during road work which had caused extensive damage to her property. The defendant had hired an insurance adjuster to do the work and had received no notice of intention to proceed. When the default judgment was entered into, the plaintiff applied to set aside the judgment on the basis that it was issued by the Prothonotary and not by the court. The applicant submitted that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse for not filing the defence. Granting the order set aside, that the defendant had failed to provide the necessary facts on which a Court could order a default judgement. This finding is sufficient for the Court to strike the default judgement under the provisions of Rule 12.06.","This was an application by the defendants to set aside a default judgment entered against them by the plaintiff. Although a statement of claim was served on the defendant, it's insurer was advised by the plaintiff's counsel that she would not proceed to judgment except on 10 days written notice. More than six months later plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to the defendant's insurer giving 10 days notice. This letter was not seen by him although he was in the process of putting together material for a solicitor to file a defence. The defendant had always advised the plaintiff that it intended to defend. No Notice of Intention, required for default judgment if six or more months had elapsed since the last step in the proceeding, was ever given to the defendant before the filing of the default judgment. Allowing the application and setting aside the default judgment, that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse on the part of the defendant for not filing the defence. Sending a letter to the insurer does not satisfy the requirement of filing a Notice of Intention to proceed. The fact that the prothonotary did not object to the request for default judgment without the Notice is immaterial."
"The appellant, who had been convicted of theft, applied for leave to appeal. Appeal allowed; sentence of 5 months incarceration to be followed by 18 months probation with an emphasis on rehabilitation. The appellant had not consumed drugs or alcohol while residing with him and had not had any problems with his use of drugs since his release on bail. The evidence showed that he had not been in the company other offenders since residing with them. The Court found that the appellant's evidence in regard to his alcohol and drug use had been unreliable and misleading. The negative information contained in the pre-sentence report, not available to the appellant until the morning of the sentence hearing, played a significant part in the disposition reached by the sentencing judge.","The appellant appealed his sentence of five months in prison to be followed by 18 months probation following his plea of guilty to the theft of his grandmother's car. Crown counsel acknowledged that this type of case would generally attract a suspended sentence with probation but for negative information in the pre-sentence report, which the appellant had not seen prior to sentencing. The appellant argued that he had seen the errors of his ways, was seeking employment, was truly remorseful, and had apologized to his grandparents, who were paying for the appeal in the hope of keeping him out of jail. The appellant was allowed to file affidavits as to the his progress concerning his problems with drugs and alcohol. Per Pugsley, J.A., Flinn, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a suspended sentence subject to terms, that the sentence imposed was not fit, and that it was not in society's interest that the appellant should be removed form his present positive environment. Per Bateman, J.A., dissenting, that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were lacking in probative value. It is left, then, to determine the fitness of the sentence at the time it was made. Taking into account the factors before the sentencing judge, the sentence imposed could not be found to be clearly unreasonable."
"This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal where the plaintiff contends that she was constructively dismissed without notice by her employer, the defendant. The issues were whether there was constructive dismissal, at what point did the plaintiff have notice of the changes which constituted constructive dismissal? HELD: The appropriate period of notice was 8 months. The plaintiff was awarded damages on the basis of eight months salary at the rate she was receiving at the time of her employment, plus vacation pay of 6% per annum and interest from July 14th to September 14th 1997. 1)It is of course an essential ingredient of constructive dismissal that the employee have absolutely failed to militage. 2)In this case the plaintiff was not only wrongfully dismissed but her employment was being terminated. 3)The employer bore the responsibility of clearly informing the employee of proposed changes. The fact that Maternity Leave is provided under the Employment Insurance Act for employed mothers is designed to provide employed mothers an opportunity to give to the new born the total care that is required in order for the child to have a good start in life. 4)The plaintiff had no notice of these changes until the letter of June 1997, which put in process events which led to the constructive dismissal as of July 14. 1997. She was, therefore, wrongfully dismissal. 5)In terms of damages, the Court favoured the testimony of the plaintiff as opposed to the defendant's. 6)The Court was of the view that the plaintiff's recollections of the discussions were more accurate and reliable.","This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff went on maternity leave for six months. During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff. The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended. She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause. She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice. Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice, that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice. This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause."
"The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they have complied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which are the subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant resisted the requested relief on the basis the plaintiffs had not validly exercised their right to first refusal. Specifically that they had not within the required time frame meet the requirements set out in the legislation. The letter from the defendant's solicitors was the first time a request was made for a letter addressed to it from the financial institution and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. HELD: The plaintiffs were entitled to relief pursuant to s27(2)(b)(ii) of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act, an order that the defendant forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs by the plaintiffs on the usualtrust conditions and a counterclaim was dismissed.  1) The defendant counterclaimed against the plaintiffs for rent it claims owing from the plaintiffs asover holding tenants. 2) To interpret the letter of commitment as a declaration in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgagefinancing, would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of First refusal. 3) The defendants counterclaimed that the offer was not an unconditional and unequivocal commitment from a recognized financial institution to finance the purchase of the land. 4) Costs of the action.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s27 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell them the lands which were subject to their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation. The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution. The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal. There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs."
"This was an application for a determination as to whether the law firm of Olive, Waller, Zinkhan & Waller is in a position of conflict of interest with respect to the matrimonial files. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information had occurred or would occur. HELD: The law firm was satisfied that the screen was sufficient in the circumstances of this case. There was no risk of real mischief and the screening measures taken by Olive Waller ensured that no disclosure to the members of the firm of the former client will occur. There were numerous independently verifiable steps which were taken to ensure no disclosure occurred. The screening measures were necessary, while necessary, to ensure there is no prejudice to any client. The evidence filed by the applicant's lawyer was that she had not had any conversations with anyone associated with the firm concerning the Magnes and L. matters, nor had she had any computer access to those files.","In issue was whether the law firm was in a conflict of interest with respect to two matrimonial files and whether the firm could remain as counsel for the spouses. HELD: 1)A lawyer with Olive Waller acts as counsel for Janie Magnes and Daniel L'Heureux. The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm. At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes. She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses. 2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case. There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur. There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening. Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her. The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet. The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter. The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs."
"The respondent's company (the third party) paid $55,000 to the applicant's father's company in contravention of an order of the Court directing any funds accruing to the respondent to be paid into court, and freezing any money to be sent into court. The applicant sought an order against the third party, requiring it to pay $55 million into court; the parties argued that the issue should be resolved at trial; the pre-trial conference should be held in January 2000; the respondent's counsel was directed to direct the issue to trial and to direct pre- trial conference. HELD: Leave was granted to remove the children to Medicine Hat; their primary residence with the applicant will thereby continue; the status quo as to access should also be maintained. The respondent was directed not to remove any of the children from the matrimonial home and to provide interim possession and exclusive possession of the property to the appellant. Pursuant to an interim order, the appellant was to pay all costs to the court, including rent, to the party and to rent out the home to enable them to attend family ski vacation. There was also an obligation to pay rent, including costs of the mortgage, to a party registered in the province and to any bank loans or advances made by party to the home. The court was satisfied that the appellant had a reasonable income and that she was not indebted to any party. The third party was directed by the court to pay costs to court and to insure that the balance of the income was properly distributed to all parties.","The applicant asserted the third party (the respondent's father's company) paid $55,000 to the respondent's company in contravention of the June 7, 1999 order which directed any funds accruing to the company be paid into court and froze any money to be paid out. The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial. The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access. The applicant had been prohibited in a 1998 order from removing the children from Saskatchewan without a court order, absent consent.HELD: 1)The issue of the payments was directed to trial and pre-trial conference to be held in January. 2)The mother was granted leave to move the children to Alberta. Their primary residence was to continue to be with her. She was encouraged to attain self-sufficiency. Access was to be maintained and the mother was ordered to return the children to Saskatchewan for purposes of allowing the respondent to exercise access in accordance with existing orders. Additional access was granted provided he picked up and returned the children to the applicant's residence. 3)The 1998 interim order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home was not changed. The applicant was at liberty to rent the home. 4)The applicant was directed to take all reasonable steps to sell the recreational trailer in her possession and to pay the sale proceeds to the bank to discharge the lien and the balance into court. She was to file an affidavit of bona fides as to the sale which should relieve her of the obligation for payment of the loan.  5)Costs were reserved to the trial."
"The accused appealed his conviction and sentence. All of the members of the Court read the notice of appeal, the relevant portions of the transcript of the trial proceedings, and the Crown factum prior to hearing his arguments. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1) The Court was unanimous in our opinion that your appeal against both conviction and sentencing must be dismissed. Your state of mind at the time you made the telephone calls which were the subject of the charges somehow exonerated you from responsibility for them. This defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it. Since the appeal against the sentence was limited to time already served by you while awaiting trial, it is now moot: that is, there is no issue to be decided. 2) The appeals against both a conviction and a sentence are dismissed.",Appeals of sentence and conviction on the grounds the transcripts of court proceedings were not available; the court would not subpoena certain witnesses on his behalf; his state of mind when he made the telephone calls exonerated him. HELD: The appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed. The judge made no error in ruling that all of the evidence from the prospective witnesses and transcripts was irrelevant as being unrelated to the charges and too remote in time. The appellant's state of mind was adequately established by his own evidence and the summation to the jury. The defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it. The sentence appeal was moot since it was limited to time served while awaiting trial. The Court would have found the sentence to be fit in any event.
"The medical resident pursuing certification as a specialist in orthopaedic surgery appealed both his suspension and probation as a medical resident and to prohibit the Investigation Committee established to look into the matter from taking further action. An appeal committee was struck pursuant to the provisions of the College of Medicine Regulations for Dealing with Unsatisfactory Evaluations and Disciplinary Action Part (RTCA). The appellant's counsel, the union's counsel and counsel for the university, raised the issue of bias on the part of the Committee. The Committee considered the matter and, by letter dated August 21, 2001, advised the appellant the decision should be reversed or altered. The appellant brought the application for an order prohibiting the committee from proceeding further and ordering him reinstated as resident. The chambers judge refused to grant the relief requested, finding the issues to be academic in nature and thus within the exclusive jurisdiction of the University, but did rule the appellant's supervisor should be removed from the committee because of an apprehension of bias. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. 1)There was no tenable basis for interfering with the Chambers judge's disposition of the application. The remedies prayed for are discretionary by nature, the writs being writs of grace and the result is not so plainly wrong as to warrant intervention (see Rimmer v. Adshead). 2)Given the long delay, including the delay in seeking recourse attributable to the appellant, the appellant must demonstrate the Chamber judge abused his discretion. No error of principal, nor any misapprehension of or disregard for any material fact has been demonstrated. Nor did the chambers judge fail to act judicially. 3)The application was premature as there were other avenues of appeal open to the applicant.","The appellant was unsuccessful in Queen's Bench in having his suspension and probation as a medical resident rescinded or to prohibit the Investigation Committee, which met on approximately seven occasions and interviewed seven witnesses, from taking further action. The Chambers judge refused to grant relief, finding the issues to be academic in nature and within the exclusive jurisdiction of the University, but ruled his supervisor should be removed from the Committee because of an apprehension of bias. The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure. He argued all committee members, except the union representative, should be excluded by reason of bias. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. 1)The material did not meet the test for the admission of fresh evidence. It simply restated what was at issue and found to have had no effect. 2)There was no tenable basis for interfering. The remedies are discretionary. 3)The Court was not prepared to grant the relief in any event, given the long delay in seeking recourse. The initial concern was bias and jurisdiction. The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below. 4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations. Proceedings should not be allowed to be fragmented and should be allowed to run their course so the court has a complete record from the tribunals below. Certiorari should not be granted where there is a right of appeal, except in exceptional circumstances."
"The petitioner sought a distribution of family property pursuant to the Family Property Act. The parties lived on an acreage and rented farm land. They carried on a mixed farming operation. The respondent did the farm work with the petitioner providing assistance. In 1996, the respondent purchased a tractor from his uncle and sold it to the petitioner for $2,200. The petitioner had no income from the farm since the separation. She now claimed an exemption in that amount. HELD: 1) The farm machinery comprises major portion of the family property. Over the years he has owned several machines and this began before the marriage. The father stated that he had no interest in any equipment owned by the respondent. Accordingly, the petitioner allowed a partial exemption and fixed the value of the tractor at $800. 2) The respondent sold his trailer and the proceeds were used to purchase the farm machinery. 3) The petitioner was awarded judgment against the respondent in the sum of $51,725.82 together with taxable costs of the action.  4) The Court weighed the oral testimony of several witnesses, including the petitioner, while also considering the content of large number of documents. It was concluded that the respondent owned a line of machinery of significant value prior to the marriage which was exempt. The Court rejected the petitioner's claim that the father owned the tractor and asserted that monies allegedly owing to him were part of a scheme to keep the family home apart from other matrimonial assets. 5) Although there were a number of outstanding debts and expenses, the majority were statute-barred and the respondent was not the actual owner of the machinery.  6) Although the respondent gave conflicting evidence as to the number of debts, the Court accepted that he owned a tractor and a J.D. 400 mix mill which were on-going expenses and related to the operation of the farm. Therefore, it was not unreasonable for him to be exempt. 7) There were several other pieces of machinery which the respondent testified were owned in part by his father and which are so endorsed in the balance sheet marked as Exhibit P-16. The majority of these items were family property at the relevant date and the Court did not accept the debt of $1,200 as being owing to the father. 8) The tractor was owned by his uncle who owned a trailer and was included in the distribution. 9) The lump sum of about $20,000 which the petitioner paid to the respondent for a truckload of farm machinery was included. The amount of interest earned would not be taxed","The wife sought distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. HELD: The petitioner was given judgment for $51,725.82 with taxable costs of the action payable within 3 months, failing which, the petitioner may apply for directions as to sale of the family property. The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm. The petitioner's claim for $1,000, borrowed from a friend to pay legal fees, was not considered a matrimonial debt."
"The Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of certain food services at the University of Saskatchewan. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties had failed. The employer had advised the Board that it was not 'prepared to make the agreement retroactive'. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1) The employer was a merchant. His products are priced in such a way as to reflect in part the labour costs involved in delivering them to the public. 2) It is not patently unreasonable to base entitlement to retroactive benefits on the serendipitous signing of a collective agreement or the signing of Board decision imposing one. In this case the employer sees it that way and as the issues in dispute were set aside. 3) The importance of a wage rise, retroactive and rather substantial if viewed as a percentage would seem to be prejudicial. 4) The employees were university students whose term was normally rather brief. The decision to allow the graduated employees to receive their back pay was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice.","A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless."
"The plaintiffs apply for certification under The Class Actions Act on behalf of the following classes as set forth in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim: (a) Veterans Resident Class Any Indian who served in the Canadian Armed Forces between 1951 and 1972 and who was discharged in 1972. The plaintiffs claim entitlement to 'Survivors' Pensions' during the Class Period as common law partners of Contributors. The claim is based on acts or omissions occurring prior to 1953 are statute barred by virtue of s. 24 of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act or by predecessor legislation to the same effect and therefore cannot constitute a cause of action. HELD: The action was dismissed as statute-barred. 1) The Court found that only if the class members succeed in this litigation and reach the bureaucratic stage of applying for the ex gratia payment will the question of individual issues arise. 2) There are a number of limitations issues, some of which are common and others that will be individual to the class member. There is no suggestion Indian War Veterans were denied the right to apply for veteran's benefits after 1953. The issue in this case is their allegation that they were not properly informed of their rights. The Court held that there was no bar to the bringing of these motions even at the pre-certification stage of the proceedings.","Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act. The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision. The Crown did not seek costs."
"The accused was convicted, after trial, of fraud exceeding five thousand dollars. He wrote a cheque for $11,000 on his personal bank account knowing that the account lacked sufficient funds. He deposited the money into his CIBC Visa account and the next day withdrew $13,000 from it. The next day, the account was still not sufficient. A Provincial Court judge sentenced him to a conditional discharge with a probation order of 1 year and a requirement of 200 hours of community service work and a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. The accused had no criminal record and had been involved in kiting for several years. The Crown took issue with the discharge and asked that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 100 hours ofcommunity service work. The Court granted leave to appeal and substituted a conditional sentence in place of the conditional discharge.","The respondent was convicted after trial of fraud exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge granted him a conditional discharge with a probation order of 1 year and a requirement of 200 hours of community service work. He also made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The learned judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1) of the Code. The sentence imposed did not properly reflect the principle of deterrence or the gravity of the offence. 2) This was a serious fraud accomplished by what the judge called a rather intricate kiting system."
"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). The trial judge applied the test that showed he was more than twice the legal limit, but the breath demand was stronger than the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. The entry of a judicial stay on the.08 charge was not used to avoid a multiple conviction issue. Volume of consumption falls within the provisions of s.253. The trial court relied on the readings contained in the Certificate of Analysis; reliance by the trial judge on the reading of the breathalyzer readings; and consideration by the Trial Judge of evidence arising subsequent to the breath request. The only error in law was that the certificate readings showed he is more than half the legal maximum; therefore, the conviction could have resulted in a new trial.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused. As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered."
"The Court dismissed the application. It found that the respondent was a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Family Maintenance Act, 1997 and that he had had that status on a continuing basis to the present time. The respondent had a gross annual income of $19,781.52. The Court was not prepared, even in the face of some shortfall, to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts.","The petitioner seeks an order for ongoing child support based on the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The respondent seeks an order that his child support obligations for their child ended July 2004 because their child ceased to be a person within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act as he was not, by reason of the pursuit of reasonable education, unable to withdraw from his mother's charge. HELD: 1) The child completed grade 12 in 2004 having turned 18 in February. He returned to high school in the fall of 2004. He worked at McDonald's during that year and lived with his mother. Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media. He is still under his mother's charge. She provides him with room and board. He is only 19 years old. He has been pursuing his education. The fact that he changed his course of study does not disentitle him to consideration for support. He is a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Act. This will continue until March 2006 when he has completed his current course of study. 2) The respondent's income fluctuates. It is appropriate to take an average of the last 3 years to determine his income.  3) Some attention must be paid to the financial ability of each parent to contribute. After deducting the table amount, the respondent would have a gross annual income of $19,781.52. On that basis the court was not prepared, even in the face of some shortfall for the child, to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts. The guideline amount is the appropriate amount to be paid until the end of this year's study."
"The Trustee in bankruptcy received a voluntary assignment for bankruptcy by the Superintendent of Bankruptcy on September 9, 2005. The Trustee was appointed as trustee of the premises. When the Trustee attended the premises, it was found that the inventory was being loaded into a van and he was unable to gain possession. A consent order was granted directing that the trustee would take possession of the assets which have given rise to the action for the purposes of completing an inventory and liquidating the assets in accordance with the normal duties and powers of the trustee. The trustee was awarded reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements directly associated with the removal and relocation of the property. The application for summary judgment was continued. There was no agreement as to the term of the application.","When the trustee attended at the premises of the bankrupt, he found the bankrupt's inventory being loaded into a van by the landlord; after obtaining a consent order which allowed it to take possession of the assets for the purposes of compiling an inventory, the trustee brought an application for summary judgment against the landlord. Application for summary judgment granted. The evidence showed that only an offer to lease had been made, with no lease agreement ever having actually been signed, and that the individual with whom the landlord had dealt was only intended to be a guarantor and never a tenant."
"Two of the plaintiffs were injured in a single vehicle accident while passengers in a vehicle driven by the other plaintiff. Both were paid damages for the injuries they sustained. Both signed releases acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident. Both the plaintiff and the defendant moved for summary judgment on evidence. In September 2004 a Statement of Claim was filed on behalf of all three plaintiffs alleging that the motor vehicle accident which occurred on October 25, 1998 was caused by an inherent defect in the design and manufacture of the vehicle being used by the plaintiff. The vehicle, 1997 Chevrolet Lumina, was manufactured by GMCL. The plaintiffs now claim damages for their injuries, which they allege were caused by the careless and negligent actions of GMCL in the manufacture of this vehicle. To allow their action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process. There were no genuine issues of material fact requiring a trial.","The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson. They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process."
"The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to ss.253(1) and 253(2)(b). The accused blew a screening device and was taken to the detachment where samples were obtained with readings of 130 mgs and 120 mgs. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's right to counsel. 1)The removal of the cell phone does give pause for thought in that the accused had initiated a procedure for obtaining legal advice which clearly could not be pursued once his cell phone was taken away. However, it is clear from the evidence that the made a conscious decision to consult with Legal Aid and, by implication, did not wish to pursue his first course of action. In this situation there was no obligation on the police officer to provide the accused with a warning. 2)The destruction of video evidence did not breach the accused’s rights under s.10(b).  3)The accused had no other recourse. He could have taken advantage of the opportunity to contact legal counsel. 4)The evidence was destroyed. The accused was not guilty of a charge of driving over.08. 5)The absence of a phone book or access to phone books was not a reason to destroy the video evidence.  6)There was no evidence of interference by the RCMP. The evidence was found to be relevant to the charge of breach of s.1(b) and to the cause of the Certificate of Accrediting, which was an independent test of credibility.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08. The accused was permitted to use his cell phone on the way to the RCMP detachment to call his wife in Calgary and request help in finding a lawyer. He did not receive a call back from his wife. The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available. The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid. After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.' The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value. The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call. The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape. The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio. The video was taped over every 60 days and had been destroyed before it was requested by defence counsel. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. Even though the accused's cell phone was taken from him before he received a call back from his wife, it is clear that the accused made a conscious decision to call Legal Aid, and by implication, did not wish to pursue the first course of action. There was no obligation on the part of the RCMP to provide the accused with a Prosper warning. The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult with another lawyer. The officer was justified in assuming that the accused was satisfied with the legal advice he had received. The Crown stayed the impaired driving count prior to the conclusion of the trial. The videotape evidence was not relevant to the .08 offence because all observations were made at roadside. The video would not have shown anything of relevance to the charge. There is no breach of the accused's rights under s. 7. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted into evidence and the accused was convicted of the .08 charge."
"The accused was charged with failing to ensure the health and safety of the employee by failing to instruct him on how to unplug a small pit in a grain terminal. The employee suffocated after stepping onto the grain in a receiving pit. The accused had not yet received hands-on training on how the safety procedure was implemented. The evidence of the incident was found to be buried in a large amount of photos, drawings and words. The court was unsure about the accuracy and reliability of the accused's evidence. The mass of material emphasized the dangers, and the importance of following the safety procedures, rather than burying them. The Court of Appeal did not accept the Crown's position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proves the actus reus of failing to insure the health of an employee. HELD: The accused was found guilty of failing in his duty to ensure employee health and health. The facts were found to rest on the testimony of several witnesses. The trial judge was not satisfied that the Crown failed to adequately instruct the employee on how and when to ununplug a large pit in the grain terminal and failed to ensure that the employee was made aware of the hazard. The matter was remitted to the Court of appeal.","HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence."
"The accused was convicted of dangerous driving, dangerous driving and assault. The accused appealed his conviction on dangerous driving. The defence argued that the trial judge failed to take into account the fact that the accused was driving slowly and in a manner that created a danger to the complainant and her young daughter. The offence was committed between spouses where minor incidental physical contact can be expected and where minor motor vehicle activity is nothing more than de minimis non curat lex and is not worthy of criminal sanction. The trial judge also found that the appellant intentionally drove in a way which created a dangerous danger for others, and drove in such a manner as to scare the complainant. The Court also questioned the trial court judge's decision in favour of the accused on dangerous drive. The appellant argued that she should have been more alert and aware of the danger to herself and her daughter. Appeal dismissed; the trial trial judge's conclusion was that the offence was between spouses and was a marked departure from the conduct expected of a reasonably prudent driver. The fact that both parties were travelling in residential neighbourhoods was a matter of concern. The evidence showed that the complainant was not in her vehicle to avoid a collision. The location of where the incident occurred elevates the dangerous nature of the appellant's actions; the fact he drove parallel to the woman and pushed her towards the side of the road is testament to the dangerousness of the manner of driving.","HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge."
"The parties entered into a separation agreement for the purpose of increasing the maintenance provision and retaining the asset division. The husband argued that the agreement should be set aside as a whole or in part under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act; alternatively, the maintenance award was of such a low amount that it is unconscionable and unduly harsh to bind the wife to such a provision. Awarding the wife $65,000, that the value of the matrimonial home is $400,000. This is an extremely fair and indeed an unequal division in her favor. If the court were to set aside the separation agreement it would find that there are no factors that have been established under the Act under which it is bound by the maintenance provisions, the court would have to make an order varying the terms of the agreement as the court sees fit.","In this divorce action the petitioner sought to have a separation agreement entered into by the parties incorporated into the corollary relief judgment. The respondent sought to have the separation agreement set aside on the grounds of duress, undue influence or unconscionsability. The couple had a traditional marriage. The petitioner earned $48,000 per year. The wife did not work outside the home and suffered from severe arthritis. For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered."
"The police officer who was assigned to investigate two alleged assaults had been charged with a disciplinary default for which she had not been charged. She challenged the decision of the Police Review Board, arguing that it was fully entitled to do so. Dismissing the application, that the Review Board's decision was patently unreasonable. Allowing the application with costs, that there was sufficient notice of the hearing and the nature of the allegation to enable the officer to formulate a proper defence. The Board acted appropriately in applying the appropriate regulation. The failure to refer to what the Review board considered the 'proper' offense in the original complaint was a technical defect only, and in no way affected the procedural fairness of the Board's proceeding.","A complaint was lodged against the applicant police officer that she had been discourteous to the victim of a sexual assault and that she had lied about being granted permission to attend a meeting held to investigate the assault. The applicant was given written notice of the substance of both allegations according to the disciplinary procedure set out in the regulations made pursuant to the Police Act, but in the space provided for the citation the notice cited only the regulation which dealt with the offense of being discourteous. A hearing before an inspector of the Police Department resulted in the applicant being found guilty of the offense of lying. She initiated a review by the Police Review Board which concluded that the section reference in the charge did not have to be accurate. The applicant brought this proceeding for judicial review and submitted that the Board's jurisdiction was limited by the citation of a particular regulation and to finding her guilty of the behaviour described in the regulation cited. Dismissing the application, that the failure to cite what the Board considered the proper offense in no way materially affected the procedural fairness of the hearings or limited the Board's jurisdiction. The applicant had complete notice of the nature of the allegations against her and was represented by counsel at the Board hearing. Certiorari will not issue for mere technical or trivial oversights and there was nothing patently unreasonable about the decision such as would warrant judicial intervention. On appeal"
"The appellant was convicted by a jury of two counts of sexual assault against his teenaged niece. He was remanded until his sentencing, on the grounds that the trial judge failed to permit the testimony of a school teacher, who had been falsely accused of making sexual comments to the complainant by the complainant, without even having heard the contradictory statement. The Crown opposed the application for release. The appellant appealed his conviction. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentence was not necessary in the public interest. The grounds of appeal were not frivolous nor did there seem much risk that he would not appear in court when ordered.","This was an application for bail pending appeal pursuant to s. 679(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, and was remanded pending sentence. The Crown opposed release. An appeal of his conviction was not scheduled to be heard for several months; his sentencing hearing was slated for more than a month after the instant chambers application. Releasing the appellant pending sentence, that his detention was not necessary in the public interest. When the grounds of appeal do have some merit, the test for release should not be more strenuous at the early stage of the proceeding"
"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant whereby the plaintiff was to build and supply a ready to move home (""RTM"") placed on basement. The plaintiff alleged the contract price stipulated in the agreement was in error and commenced rectification of the contract. The defendant employee who had been commissioned salesman for the plaintiff for 15 years now admitted that he had given the plaintiff an idea of the cost of the project in May 1992, when the defendants met with the plaintiff to inquire about having the plaintiff build an RTM for them. The defendants acknowledged that the price for the project was $106,000 plus GST which was not included in the contract but admitted that the amount was part of the price quoted. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for interest was dismissed. 1)There was no clear and convincing evidence that the defendants knew or ought to have known the price of the basement and that such an agreement was made. The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% wasinserted into the document and I am not satisfied that there was an agreement reached by the parties to pay interest. 2)The plaintiff was entitled to interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act on $1,716.28.",The plaintiff was to build and supply to the defendants a ready to move home (RTM). The plaintiff alleged the contract price was in error and sought rectification of the contract. The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had. HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed. 1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted. He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest. The plaintiff was entitled to interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act on the claim for extras to the contract. 4)The claim for the extras was never in dispute. The defendants were entitled to costs of the action.
"Paterson Sons appealed an arbitration award respecting a contract dispute between it and Rail Contractors. The contract provided that either party can refer any dispute respecting their contractual obligations to arbitration. The dispute arose between the parties respecting the performance of the contract and both parties agreed to a resolution by arbitration. They each retained legal counsel, agreed on an arbitrator, and defined the issues to be resolved. The arbitrator heard two days of viva voce evidence, admitted several documents as exhibits, received written legal briefs from counsel, and subsequently rendered a written decision that dealt with all the issues before him. The award was favourable in most respects to the position taken by the respondent. However, the errors complained about were the very questions that were referred to the arbitrator fordetermination. The Court declined to award costs to the respondent respecting the enforcement application. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed. There was no provision in the arbitration contract for an appeal.  1)The findings of fact with which the appellant takes issue were not questions of law but rather questions of fact. 2)The Court was required to give judgment enforcing the award by s.50(3) of the Act. As none of the parties set out in the Act continue to apply, no appeal can be brought without leave.","The contract for the construction of a spur rail line to the grain terminal provided that either party could refer any contract dispute to arbitration. The Arbitrator's award favoured the A &amp; E Rail Contractor's position. Leave to appeal had been granted. At issue was were whether the arbitrator applied the correct measure of damages and whether there was any evidence to support the findings of fact. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed. The respondent's application for enforcement of the award was granted without costs. 1)The issues were questions of fact not law. The errors complained of were the same questions referred to the arbitrator for determination. Adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' did not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law. The wording on the second issue was changed slightly to read 'in his calculation as to damages awarded for increased costs of winter construction'. There was some evidence upon which the arbitrator could make a finding of fact. 2)As none of the bars set out in the Act applied the court was required by s50(3) to give judgment enforcing the award.  3)The application for costs on a solicitor and client basis was denied. Failing agreement between the parties, the appellant would pay the respondent's taxed costs on the appeal on a party and party basis."
"The deceased made a will and codicil in November 1989 and December 11, 1989 respectively. Neither made any provision for the younger child. The will was subject to sale in the Executor's absolute discretion with the like discretion to apply the net income and to encroach on capital for the maintenance of the child until he reached the age of twenty-one years. The petitioner sought an order under the Dependents' Relief Act varying child maintenance from $150 per child to $1,245 per month for the two children. The executors did not oppose the application under the Wident's Relief Act however they did put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of child maintenance. HELD: 1)The children were to receive their entire estate estate. 2)The term 'personal effects' does not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the business oroperations of the farm. There was nothing within the will, read as a whole, with reference to the ordinary rules of construction whichrequires the term 'Personal effects' to be given anything other than its ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the Testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles.  3)The estate was substantially smaller, the children had a longer period of dependency and there would be reserves remaining for unknown contingencies and expenses. These calculations are only crude estimation but have attempted to consider the children's current needs weighed against what the Estate can reasonably bear in all the unknown circumstances, while still giving effect to the testator's intentions to preserve the farmlands in specie for conveyance to the children at age twenty years of age.","The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate."
"FIAT. After the parents separated, the parties entered into a Custody and Maintenance Agreement. The father argued that he should be granted access every second weekend, every second Christmas and Easter and two weeks in the summer all unsupervised. HELD: The father was granted specified access. He was to provide Jodi-Lin with at least 30 days notice of which days he will be exercising his rights of access. 1)The father's generous and farreaching requests were not reasonable given his record of non-contact with his daughter. It was important that he be reintroduced to his daughter in a gradual and consistent fashion. He had not seen his daughter for in over 3 years. 2)It was expected that the father would be travelling to Saskatchewan before the end of June and accordingly David should be given an opportunity to see his daughter more often. He admitted that he could probably only exercise some access rights two or three times per year and even at that he may not be able to afford to travel that often.","FIAT. The parties entered a custody and maintenance agreement with respect to the one child of their common law relatinship in 1989. The mother moved with the daughter to British Columbia in 1997. The parties did not agree upon ongoing access. HELD: The father's generous and far reaching requests were not reasonable at this time given his lengthy non-contact. It was important that he be reintroduced to his 10 year old daughter in a gradual and consistent fashion. He was granted access intitially for three and four hours in both provinces, then two days at the father's parent's home including overnight access and two days in the summer in British Columbia. Weekly telephone access was to continue each Sunday evening. Access was to be reviewed in the fall of 1998."
"The sole unsecured creditor was Revenue Canada with a proved claim of $89,000 for unpaid income tax and unremitted G.S.T. The bankrupt had been self employed and through indifference, disregard and neglect did not pay his taxes for 15 years. He was 43 years old, in good health and had no dependants. He had an enviable income. HELD: A conditional order was ordered requiring the bankrupt to pay $500 per month by monthly installments of $500. The trustee calculated surplus income of $435. He would be required to make regular instalment payments on his self-employment income and comply with income tax, G.s.T.(1) and G. S.T(2) filing requirements. The objecting creditor was entitled to costs of $400 out of the estate.","The bankrupt was self-employed and failed to pay his taxes, owing Revenue Canada $89,000. The trustee calculated surplus income at $435 per month and recommended a conditional order of discharge requiring the payment of $7,800. Revenue Canada objected, requesting a conditional order for monthly payments of $750 over 4 years. HELD: Conditional order of discharge granted. The court found that the bankrupt was 43 years old, in good health and with no dependents. The bankrupt was also a self-employed contractor with an 'enviable' income. Following a review of the bankrupt's financial material on file, the court ordered the bankrupt to pay $500 per month for 3 years, to make regular installment payments on his self-employment income and comply with tax filing requirements."
"The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death and causing bodily harm arising out of her operation of a motor vehicle. She appealed her conviction and raised numerous grounds of appeal. The appellant was found guilty of criminal liability causing death (s. 220); causing death in the operation of motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (s.) 255(3); criminal negligence in the performance of bodily harm (s."") and causing death while impaired (s). The appellant appealed her convictions and raised several grounds of appeals. Allowing the appeal reducing the appeal to a matter of probabilities, that the trial judge erred in law in refusing to grant stay of all charges, when he had determined that the appellant's ability to operate a motor car was impaired by impaired byalcohol (s) 255(2). The trial judge further erred by making inconsistent findings concerning the impact of the Charter breach upon the refusal charge in his attempt to fashion remedy.","The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death, causing death in the operation of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and causing bodily harm while under the influence of alcohol. The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury. Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial. Finally, there were no errors by the judge on any of the other grounds advanced for appeal."
"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. His case went to Youth Justice Court for review under s. 103 of the YCJA. The Crown appealed the Youth Court judge's decision and argued that, on a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1) The proper Interpretation of Section 102(1) is that s. 102(2) includes the word 'apprehension' after the reference to s. 107. It is included in s.102(2). As the provincial director reviewed the matter in detail, he concluded that the sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. In consequence, she held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and community supervision order. 2) Section 107(1)(b) does not set out the broad principles of rehabilitation and reintegration. The only thing that can be said for certain is that the conditional supervision of a young person is suspended under the Youth Code. The fact that the youth is not deemed to be continuing to serve the youth sentence as a whole directly undercuts the objectives of the young person who is serving it.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself."
"FIAT: The applicant applies for an order in the nature of certiorari quashing or setting aside the decisions of the Board's case management division and appeals committee. HELD: The application is dismissed. The parties may speak to costs. 1) The impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction so that there was no proper decision from which to appeal, leaving the applicant with an adequate alternative remedy. The questions were: 1) In the nature and extent of jurisdiction the legislature regarded this as sufficient in matters of workers' compensation, likely because of the extensive system that it established in the Act; 2) Whether or not each of the impugning decisions was made without a jurisdiction and consequently is a nullity, the applicant had an adequate remedy available to him. No special circumstances, that might justify judicial intervention, could be presented. An order requiring the application to be sent to the applicant was not available.","FIAT: In December 2000, the medical review panel of the Workers' Compensation Board of Saskatchewan decided that the applicant was not fit for work. On January 2005, the Board's appeals committee upheld a 2004 decision of the Board's case management division that the applicant was fit for employment. Although the applicant has another avenue of appeal available to him within the workers' compensation system, he takes the position that the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction, so that there is no proper decision from which to appeal, leaving him with an application for judicial review as his only remedy. HELD: Whether or not the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction and consequently are a nullity, the applicant has an adequate alternative remedy available to him. No special circumstances that might justify judicial intervention at this time have been presented. An order in the nature of certiorari is not available to him because he has not yet pursued his right of appeal. The application is dismissed."
The plaintiff claimed damages for a motor vehicle accident which occurred as a result of the negligence of the defendant in the operation of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police motor vehicle. The plaintiffs alleged that the accident occurred because the defendant's headlights were not in operation when it approached the intersection. The defendant testified that he had just finished a police call in Cherry Brook and he had been requested by attending police officers to undergo breathalyser. The plaintiff also claimed that she had had two White Russians during the course of the evening. At issue was whether the defendants' vehicle was operating properly when it was struck by the plaintiff's vehicle and whether the plaintiff was contributory to the accident. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed.  1) The evidence of the lay witnesses was not admissible. There was insufficient evidence to establish the officer was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony.  2) The plaintiff did not see the police vehicle approaching the intersection at the time of the motor vehicle collision. The evidence was unrealistic. 3) The Court could not accept the witness could remember the detail of location and speed that she gave in some of her evidence. The testimony of the police officer could not be accepted because she was standing about a half-hour from the time she heard the screech of the brakes until she reached the Police vehicle.,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact."
"The applicant sought an order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Criminal Code) relating to the issuance of a search warrant on May 3, 2005. The search warrant alleged that the accountant filed fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund, and misreported HST sales. An earlier Information had been considered for the purpose of obtaining a warrant. The applicant claimed the judge erred in concluding that the necessary grounds existed for the search. In light of his clear statement on cross-examination, the applicant said he would not have pursued a warrant without the information provided by the informant. He also claimed that the judge ought to have recused himself from considering the application to issue a warrant, having previously acted in a solicitor/client relationship with the spouse of the applicant. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) The informant did not say that he would have sought the warrant in the absence of the defective paragraphs but only that he was more comfortable omitting information that he now knows to be erroneous. The judge's own evidence supports the inference that he wouldn't have pursued the search without the paragraphs 20-23 in the Information. Unless real bias can be shown, such prior contact is not sufficient to raise the issue of bias. 2) The existence of fraud, non-disclosure, misleading evidence and new evidence are all relevant but rather than being prerequisite to review, their sole impact is to determine whether there continues to be any basis for the decision of the authorizing judge.","The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias."
"The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration of his blood exceeded 80 milligrams in 100 milliliters of blood. The accused denied having care or control of the vehicle, and argued that he was too intoxicated to drive. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of either offence.  1) The risk assessment should not involve conjecture or speculation. It may be speculation to conclude that every driver whose BAC exceeds 80, might change his mind; however, it would be wrong to preclude a trial court from assessing the risk of change of intention, on the facts of the individual case, especially where it is accepted that one effect of the consumption of alcohol is the impairment of judgment. 2) The accused's acts involved the use of the car's equipment to turn the key in the ignition to the accessories position and to play music on the stereo. The defendant's car was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building; the parking brake was engaged; the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running. In order for it to go anywhere but into the wall of the adjacent building, the parking brakes would have to be started, the Parking brake released and the transmission put into reverse gear. There was little, if any, danger of the motor vehicle being set in motion unintentionally, or of its thereby becoming a danger to the public.","The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public."
"The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. H.H. was the mother of the children. The father was apprehended by the Ministry when the children were born. Both children were the subject of a consent order for six months on October 2, 2007. Both the mother and the father were in the Ministry's care for most of their lives. The Ministry asked the order be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children.HELD: HELD: The order was granted. The children were to be returned to the father with conditions, including that he would not contact the mother, receive addiction counselling, participate in anger management and provide drug screen results, and remain drug free and provide support to the mother. 1) The evidence showed that the father had a substantial criminal record, which included 16 offences as youth. His youth offences were primarily property crimes and failures to comply with dispositions made concerning his offences. 2) The father proposed that he will continue living with the mother while the mother first attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he would address his own addiction problems. The permanency committee had explored resources with the Indian Band but the Band indicated that there were no resources on the Reserve. The mother was to attend parenting classes, continue with the methadone program and take anger management courses and provide evidence to the Ministry that she had failed to follow through with her addiction counselling courses. Although the mother was a party to the consent order, she did not appear at the hearing and her history can only be gleaned from the documents filed as exhibits and the testimony of others.","The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them."
"This is still an “action” and not a “class action”. The plaintiff brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order compelling the defendant to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant. The motion was dismissed. HELD: The Court dismissed the application for examination.  1) The Court’s usual approach to civil litigation does not allow for plaintiff to demand defendant produce plaintiff. Secondary the wording of s. 14 and s. 24 of the Act precludes this type of pre-certification notice. The Court reviewed cases from Ontario that neither the section dealing with the service of notice nor the general provision allowing the Court to make any order considers appropriate are limited to actions that have already been certified. 2) It is important to keep in mind that we are in the pre certification stage of this proceeding and this is still a class action. The court is still trying to figure out how it came to be that the phrase “settlement” entered into by the defendants in the Holguin vacation package could be interpreted as meaning settlement. 3) In this case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potentially class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. That could result in further motions arising out of this examination. Based on the plain wording of the statement of claim and the context of the preparation of the affidavit, it was clear that the defendant could not rely on s. 13 prior to certification. 4) The court was not prepared to broaden the scope of the hearing to include examination of other witnesses.","Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction."
"This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. The appellant was 60 years old and the respondent was 53. Both parties had some health problems. The respondent was diagnosed with breast cancer, had had surgery followed up by radiation, and was now living with her father. Both had children, born in 1984 and 1989. The parties had two adult children, aged 60 and 53. The mother had sold her house, used the proceeds to spend 4 months out of Canada, living in Hawaii and spending a monthlong vacation in Jamaica. She assumed a substantial portion of the respondent's support during the year following the one year spousals order. The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining the mother on the basis that she was over 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student.","The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge."
"The petitioner served the respondent with a formal offer of settlement in September 2010. The offer was not accepted (and indeed never was accepted) and the case proceeded to trial. About a week after the conclusion of the trial, the petitioner revoked his offer. HELD: The petitioner was awarded party to party costs under Column 3 and double party to car costs under column 3. The court awarded costs to the respondent. The petitioner is entitled to party to a party costs in Column 3.","Supplementary reasons to 2010 SKQB 439. The petitioner served the respondent with a formal offer of settlement on September 14, 2010. The offer was not accepted and the matter proceeded to trial. A week after the trial was concluded and while the decision was reserved, the offer was revoked. The petitioner applies for costs against the respondent pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184B. HELD: Queen's Bench Rule 184B calls for double costs from the date of service of the offer. The fact the offer was revoked does not alter the concept in Rule 184B and the resulting sanction. The petitioner was awarded party to party costs under Column 3 up to September 14, 2010 and double party of party costs under Column 3 thereafter, together with the costs for this application. All costs were payable forthwith."
"The applicant obtained an order for possession pursuant to s. 3(3) of The Recovery of Possession of Land Act, 1978 granting possession of land and premises described as 1615 Broadway Avenue, Saskatoon. The proposed appellant filed a Notice of Appeal alleging certain facts with respect to why the order ought not to have been made. [1] Mr. Webb applied pursuant to Rule 46.1(1) of the Court of Appeal Rules to quash the Notice of appeal on the basis that it was entirely without merit by reason that there was evidence before the Court and no factual basis on which the appeal could have been brought, heard and disposed of. [4] The matter was adjourned sine die with leave to bring the matter back before me on five days notice should the proposed appellant be unsuccessful in the Court OF Queen's Bench.","The respondent applied to quash the Notice of Appeal on the basis that the appeal was entirely without merit because there was no factual basis on which the appeal could have been brought, heard and disposed of. HELD: Rather than filing an appeal, the respondent should have pursued a remedy in Queen's Bench. The proper procedure would have been to apply under Queen's Bench Rule 271 to have the matter opened up and disposed of on the basis of the evidence. The matter was adjourned sine die with leave to bring the matter back to Court if the appellant is unsuccessful at Queen's Bench."
"The Crown appealed the sentencing judge's order under s.490.012(1) of the Criminal Code, which directed the accused to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) for 20 years. The accused was convicted on each of four charges of sexual assault. As the Crown proceeded by indictment, he was subject to imprisonment for term not exceeding ten years on each conviction. He was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 4 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20 year SOIRA compliance order. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed. The sentencing judge erred in law in his interpretation of s. 490.013(2.1). The meaning of the section is plain: offenders who commit multiple designated offences will be subject to a lifetime SOIIRA compliance Order. Nothing in the Code suggests the lifetime duration of the order rests on the offender being sentenced separately for each offence. The Court of Appeal disagrees.","The accused was convicted of four counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown had proceeded by indictment and the accused was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 8 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20-year Sexual Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) compliance order. At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order. If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3). Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who committed multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or altogether."
"The accused, who was convicted of conspiring with others to traffic in cocaine, applied for judicial interim release pending his appeal. In the weeks immediately before the trial, Crown counsel disclosed the existence of approximately 1,900 documents. The Crown sought to have the trial adjourned for a further day to allow proper review of the documents. During that time, defence counsel also requested that the trial be set aside and new trial ordered. HELD: The application to adjourn the trial was granted. The Court found that to allow the conviction to stand in the face of all relevant circumstances would amount to a miscarriage of justice as the accused could not demonstrate that late and non-disclosure affected his right to make full answer and defence. As the accused had disclosed the documents to defence counsel, the Court was in the same position as the trial judge and could not assess the undisclosed documents to determine whether the undisclosed information could have affected the verdict. A new trial was the only remedy available.","HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure."
"The appellant applies for an order staying the execution of an interim order which provided ongoing spousal support for the appellant's wife, the respondent in the amount of $10,000 per month; gave her exclusive possession of the family home; provided for shared parenting of their son and awarded child support of $2,726 per month. The appellant appealed only portions of the interim order relating to spousals and exclusive possession. He has made all of the payments required by the order, except for the spousaling support arrears. The respondent has filed a garnishees to collect those arrings. Application allowed; stay imposed in respect to enforcement of the retroactive Spousal Support Arrears created by the January 20, 2016 interim order. While the appellant may be prejudiced by the imposition of the stay, the appellant would not be unduly prejudiced.","HELD: The application was allowed and the stay of the enforcement of retroactive spousal support was granted. There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support. If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced. The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support."
"The accused was charged with possession of child pornography, contrary to s. 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code. The accused was a member of the RCMP Internet Child Exploitation Unit (ICE) and testified that he monitored file sharing networks for subjects who were accessing, possessing, or sharing child pornography using file sharing software. The ICE unit was involved in the investigation. The Court found that the accused had access to child pornography through a router. The router was used to direct traffic between the residence and the residence. As the residence was often visited by persons accessing the centralized server model, it is not possible for the data to end up at some other device because of the internal IP of the computer and the physical MAC address of the particular computer.","HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt."
"Reliable Truck Trailer Inc. is a mobile vehicle and associated equipment repair company situated in Pense, Saskatchewan. In 2015 it entered into an oral agreement with Super Save, Inc. in which it agreed to provide, on a 'call out' basis, repair services for Super Save's fleet of trucks and related equipment. Between the summer of 2015 and June of 2016, it ceased to pay invoices as they became due. Eventually the plaintiff demanded payment of its outstanding invosices and the defendant denied it. HELD: A fair and reasonable price to be paid for the goods and services provided by the plaintiff to the defendant. 1) In businesses such as the plaintiff's, the industry anticipates that either travel time to and from the work location is regularly billed and paid for, or alternatively, that minimum period of time is charged. The plaintiff has not quantified its costs. Even if this evidence had been led, the Court would still have reservations in accepting this argument because it has heard no convincing evidence of detriment reliance. 2) The plaintiff bears the burden of proof on a balance of probabilities to convince the Court that it is entitled to the quantum of damages that it seeks. There was no express term in the contract to be used. The contractual quantum meruit is the principle underlying the principles of estoppel by convention and was articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Ryan Moore. The essential terms that define any contractual relationship are determined by importing into the contract an implied term to the effect that the parties agreed to charge a fair, reasonable price for goods, services, and goods. In so doing, the party has suffered detriment, such that it would be unfair or unjust to allow one of the parties to resile or depart from the common assumption.","HELD: On the basis of the evidence presented by the parties’ experts and in absence of an express term in the contract, the court read in an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price and awarded the plaintiff such portion of the amount sought as was fair and reasonable. The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work."
"This was an action brought by Fossil Fuel Development Ltd. against Tudex Petroleums Ltd. (Tudex) for breach of contract claiming damages. In its counterclaim, Fossil sought rescission of the contract and damages. The defendant argued that the agreement between the parties was breached when there was a failure of a performance by the respondent in an essential part of the Contract. Dismissing the counterclaim with costs, that the evidence established that the respondent had not rebutted the contract. The respondent had accepted the performance of the respondent on the marketing study and paid the consideration therefor. There was no basis for rescission.","The Plaintiff contracted to provide market survey to the Defendant. Before its completion, the contract was replaced by second contract for Fund Development Officer. Each party had a different understanding of the duties of the Fund Development Officer which misunderstanding the Judge classified as a mutual mistake. The failure of performance by plaintiff entitled defendant to repudiate the contract. Defendant's counterclaim for rescission of first agreement, and repayment of monies paid under second agreement, failed where it accepted plaintiff's performance and paid consideration therefore."
"The tenants entered a standard form lease in 1989. By virtue of its terms, the lease was automatically renewed for a further term of one year from March 1, 1990 if either party gave notice of termination three months prior to the date of the lease. This was a three percent guideline increase on the base rent which was accepted by the respondents. The appellant offered to permit the respondents to terminate the release on three months notice if they were unhappy with the rental increase. The respondents chose not to exercise this option. The Board considered the issue and determined that the landlord could not unilaterally increase the rent during the yearly tenancy. The increase was only once every twelve months. The court allowed the appeal and set aside the decision of the trial judge and the decision and recommendation of the Rent Review Board.","The issue in this appeal was whether a landlord can give notice of a rental increase at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease. Section of the lease provides for increases upon months notice to the tenant. The trial judge found that notice must be given months prior to the expiration of the lease. For the appellant, that notice of a rental increase may be given at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease."
"The parties signed a separation agreement dated September 6, 1996. The agreement provided, among other things, that the parties would live separately and that neither would claim spousal support from the other. The following clause appeared in the agreement: 'For a period of more than 90 days with reconciliation as the primary purpose of the cohabitation, the provisions contained in the Agreement will be void.' HELD: Counsel proceeded on the basis that the separation agreement was between the parties and was not subject to change. The respondent was evasive, argumentative andultimately untruthful in his answers to a number of questions. He questioned the nature of the agreement in light of the narrow issue presented to him.  1)The circumstances surrounding the signing of the so-called separation agreement and the reason he gave for the grantedit;   2)The untrue statements he set out in his divorce petition in Ontario as to his residency, statements that he swore as true in his subsequent application for divorce judgment;  3)His action in applying for a default judgment in the divorce proceedings when he knew the petitioner hadserved his solicitor with her Answer.  4)The parties clearly intended to re-establish their life together as husband and wife in the fullest sense. They swore that they cohabited for ten days in May 1997 and from June 28 1997 until September 30 1997.  5)The respondent disputed that evidence and insisted that the period of cohabitations extended from June 30 1997 until June 18. If the petitioner's account is accepted, the co-habitation would have extended for period of at least 95 days.","In issue was whether the parties cohabited for more than 90 days and thereby vitiate their 1996 separation agreement to live separate and apart. The Agreement provided that neither would claim spousal support.HELD: 1)Credibility was determinative. The wife was articulate, intelligent and forthright while the husband was found to be evasive, argumentative and untruthful in answering a number of questions including the circumstances surrounding the signing of the agreement, the untrue statements he set out in his divorce petition in Ontario regarding his residency and in applying for default judgment when he knew the petitioner had served an Answer. 2)The agreement was rendered 'void' by the fact the parties cohabited for more than 90 days. 3)Costs were left to the trial judge."
"The respondent made a proposal to its creditors under the provisions of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. A competitor, Datarite, operating through the appellant, acquired the claims of eighteen creditors and voted them over the objections of LaserWorks at a creditors meeting. Only two of the remaining sixteen creditors opposed the proposal. The respondent submits that the judge erred when she declined to address and reverse the Registrar's finding that 18 creditors had been assigned their rights to the appellant. Dismissing the appeal, that the court's inherent supervisory jurisdiction should not be invoked to interfere in proposal to creditors in bankruptcy when it appears the statutory process is being used for purposes not contemplated by Parliament. The court's focus is on preventing an abuse of a class of creditors by a third party.","The respondent made a proposal to its creditors under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. A competitor, operating through the appellant company, acquired the claims of 18 creditors and voted them over the objections of the respondent at a meeting of the creditors, defeating the proposal. Only two of the 16 remaining creditors opposed the proposal. The Registrar disallowed the appellant's votes, and found the proposal had been accepted by the votes of the remaining creditors. The Supreme Court upheld the decision. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant attempted to abuse the provisions of the Act by using them to interfere for an improper purpose with the proposal of a debtor to its creditors. The Registrar made no error in discerning this from the evidence and in exercising the court's discretionary jurisdiction to remedy this substantial injustice."
The appellant/plaintiff's claim in Small Claims Court was dismissed by the Provincial Court judge for want of prosecution. The respondents/defendants declined to consent to an order directing a new trial even if the order awarded costs. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new Trial was ordered in Small claims Court. There was no order as to costs. The principles set out in Horosko v. Huber were applicable. The appellant/ plaintiff should not be deprived of his day in court because of an institutional scheduling error which arose through no fault on the plaintiff's part. A defendant in the circumstances should consent to a newtrial so that the claim can be presented and its merits determined by the Court.,The appellant's claim was dismissed for want of prosecution. The date and courtroom number for the trial on the note given to him by court staff were inverted and he appeared in Small Claims Court the day following its dismissal. The defendants declined to consent to an order directing a new trial. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered in Small Claims Court without order as to costs. A plaintiff should not be deprived of a trial because of an institutional scheduling error. The principles set out in Horosko v. Huber were applicable.
"The accused was charged with three counts in relation to one incident occurring March 20, 1999 at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan: impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(a), over.08 contrary to ss. 253(b) and 255(3) and driving while disqualified contrary so s. 259(4), all of the Criminal Code of Canada. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2 in the Information. 1) The Court was unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the first sample was obtained within 2 hours of the accident. There was no bad intent on the part of the Crown as they stated and accept there was only one person in the cab of the truck. The evidence of the driver of the Sunfire and the accused was rejected. 2) There must be a manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behavior in order for the Court to find that there has been a breach of fundamental justice. The right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of this evidence in these circumstances.","Accused charged with impaired driving, being over.08 and driving while disqualified. The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases. Here the right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence as the Court was able to assess the weight to be given to the officers' evidence. The Charter application for a stay of proceedings alleging a breach of fundamental justice is denied."
"The owner of a rental property applied for a variance converting the existing use to a single family dwelling without changing the side yard requirements. The application was withdrawn and the owner, in turn, sought a finding that he was in contempt of the Consent Order. HELD: 1)The property was inspected and the front portion of the property was unoccupied. Negotiations took place between the owner and the parties in part because the accommodation was rented out to separate groups of students. The owner was permanently enjoined from using the property in contravention of the Land Use By-Laws. 2)The fine was not to be crystalized into a Judgment and Execution until the owner fully complied with all the requirements of the Order. 3)The owner was to provide a copy of any written leases or alternation in the lease or tenants to him. 4)The Court found no reason why the owner should not be required to provide within fifteen days the names of all tenants and if and when there are changes in any of the tenants, he should provide HRM within 15 days of such change the particulars of the new and remaining tenants. The Court ordered the owner to advise any and all tenants in writing prior to entry of occupation that the entire structure and building is only to be occupied as a single dwelling unit. Given the history of the matter and the fact that the owner had not occupied the building and apparently resided in Blockhouse, the Court considered random inspections that could be every week as an excessive imposition.","The defendant made an addition to single family residence. Following a dispute between the parties as to whether the defendant's use of the property now complied with the plaintiff's land-use bylaw for a single family residence, a consent order was issued dealing with the structure of the property and how it would be used. The plaintiff sought a finding that the defendant was in contempt of the consent order, seeking enforcement of the provisions of the consent order and an order that the defendant pay a fine. Defendant found in contempt of consent order; fine ordered in the amount of $10,000; if defendant has not complied with the terms of the consent order by January 31, 2002, the Sheriff is ordered to enter the property and receive the rents, profits and income thereof until the defendant clears his contempt; the door and hardware between the original structure and the addition is be removed; any references to separate apartments are to be removed from the property; the second power meter is to be removed from the property and the second cable television connection and associated billing provisions are to be eliminated; the defendant is to provide within 15 days the names of all tenants and if and when there are changes in any of the tenants, he must provide the plaintiff with the particulars of the new and remaining tenants; all tenants must be notified in writing prior to entry of occupation that the entire structure and building is only to be occupied as a single dwelling unit; copies of any written leases are to be provided to the plaintiff within 15 days of their execution; the plaintiff can enter the premises for the purposes of random inspection on a bi-monthly basis until the plaintiff is satisfied that this Order has been complied with and thereafter, the plaintiff is entitled to inspect the premises at random once a month while the defendant remains the owner of the property; the fine will not be crystallized into a judgment and execution if the defendant complies fully with all the requirements of this order on or before January 1, 2002. The plaintiff is entitled to solicitor-client costs."
"FIAT. The respondent registered owner under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, 1985, c. B-3, as am. by the bankruptcy and insolvency act, S.C. 1992, s. 2 and instrument appointed receiver of the registered owner on behalf of the HSBC Bank, a secured creditor and mortgagee of certain real property of the Registered Owner applies for a vesting order with respect to a sale of the real property. The vesting orders applied for would register title in favour of the proposed purchaser of the property obtained as a result of a year long effort by the applicant trustee to sell it. The mortgagee, HSBC Bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeds the purchase price of the home. The onus is on the applicant to prove to the court that all such parties have been served. HELD: Based upon the submissions of counsel for the applicant, the Court was satisfied that the jurisdiction formerly granted to the Court by s. 87 of the Land Titles Act, 1978 was not brought forward by the new Land Titling Facilitation Regulations, 2000 combined with ss. 12 and 65 of The Queen's Bench Act and in particular Regulation 6.5 dealing with vesting ordering.  1) The application for the vesting ordered applied for is granted. The form of the draft order filed with the applicant solicitor's subsequent submissions may issue.  2) The applicant's interests are not adversely affected. There are no subsequent encumbrancers, competing creditors nor the Registered owner's rights respecting redemption or preservation of equity (there is none) are adversely affected if the order is granted; neither HSBC nor the applicant school trustee proceeded with foreclosure proceedings against the property in question. The application is granted based upon the information provided by the respondent.","FIAT. The receiver manager of the registered owner (the numbered company) under the Bankruptcy Act and the instrument appointed receiver on behalf of the secured creditor and mortgagee (HSBC Bank) applied for a vesting order. The trustee had tried to sell the real property for year. HELD: The vesting order was granted. 1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so. In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87. 2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor. The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price. The registered owner had taken no opposition. No other interests will be adversely affected. 3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment."
"This is an appeal by the City of Regina and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision dated October 10, 2003, of Roger J. F. LePage sitting as a Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Court found that the tribunal erred in law in finding that the City was responsible for the discrimination against the applicant on the basis of his disability. CUPE had no claim to the right to be recalled into the position as a result of the applicant's disability. 2) The tribunal failed to consider the fact that the applicant had Cerebral Palsy as a factor in his decision to leave the City. The applicant had demonstrated that he could not perform the job of a casual employee in the City, given that his speech was impaired by his disability and he was given priority over other casual employees in the position. The discrimination was real and it was beyond the scope of the tribunal's jurisdiction. 3) The applicant did not have a disability. The fact that he was able to work for the City and was awarded a pay scale of 4% to reflect his time in the job, rather than the usual 5% to 6% pay scale, had no effect on his ability to gain permanent status. The tribunal was unable to find that the city accommodated the applicant adequately, reasonably and to the point of undue hardship. There were other factors that contributed to the discrimination, but the court found that there was no inherent jurisdiction in this appeal.","This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal."
FIAT. This was an application to set aside a noting for default and the resulting default judgment. The main ground of the application is that the service of the statement of claim on the defendant did not comply with Rule 19(1) of The Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The application was dismissed. The notice of service received was valid and the defendant admitted into Court. The court had no alternative but to dismiss the application and validate the earlier service upon the defendant be registered mail. The defendant did acknowledge that the notice had been received but did not state the reasons for the noting. The plaintiff is entitled to the taxable costs of the applications.,FIAT: This is an application to set aside a noting for default and the resulting default judgment. The main ground of the application is that the service of the statement of claim on the defendant did not comply with Rule 19(1) of The Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The application is dismissed and the service upon the defendant by registered mail is validated. 1) Rule 19(1) of the Rules must be read in conjunction with Rule 18. 2) Queen's Bench Rule 18 is new rule and came into effect in December 2002. No authorities were available that considered its provisions. 3) Rule 18 requires the defendant to satisfy the court that he has not received notice of the document. 4) The defendant admits receiving a copy of the statement of claim by registered mail and the fact that it did not constitute valid service is of no assistance to him.
"The father applied to vary the corollary relief judgment, which varied the date of his divorce and the amount of support payable. He sought a termination of spousal support or alternatively a decrease in support with a fixed date for termination. The wife suffered from serious mental illness and was in receipt of income from her pension. He received a severance package and pension from the military. She was expected to start work in September 2008. The father was to pay maintenance of $300 per month for five years. The corollaries relief judgment was granted in 1998 and in 2002. In his amended application dated June 23, 2005, he seeks a termination or a decrease of support with an order for variation. He also seeks costs of the application.HELD: The application was heard in June 2005. The applicant's income is now primarily derived from his pension. The reasonableness of the previous order was that it was indefinite and the fact that the wife was handicapped prevented her from earning sufficient income to support the father. The court was sympathetic to the wife's need for support and to the applicant's need to see an end to this obligation. Although there was some change in the circumstances of the marriage (the wife's disability did not preclude her from continuing to receive support), the court could not conclude that his obligation to her should extend beyond the length of their marriage. On the issue of economic hardship, the respondent's circumstances were the same as they were at the time of the granting of the divorce. Although he had some employment since retirement, the circumstances were still relatively young and there was no evidence she was unable to contribute anything at all towards her own support.","The husband applied to vary a corollary relief judgment in order to either terminate spousal support or decrease it with a fixed date for termination. The parties were married for twelve years and had been divorced for seven years. The husband had been paying $600 per month in spousal support since the divorce and had recently retired from the military; his current income was now primarily derived from his pension. The wife had serious long-term mental illness and was unable to manage employment. The parties' teenage son was now solely in the husband's care. Spousal support reduced to $300 per month payable for a further three years at which point it will terminate. Notwithstanding the wife's disability, the husband's obligation to her should not extend beyond the length of their marriage; although the wife might not be able to become totally self-sufficient, there was no evidence that she was unable to contribute anything at all towards her own support."
"The appellant appeals his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the Court accepting fresh evidence. The central issue at trial was whether the drugs found at the premises being rented by one s. Bodkin belonged to the appellant or to the complainant. The appellant did not follow the procedure outlined by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Lévesque in making this fresh evidence application. HELD: The appellant's application to adduce fresh evidence was dismissed. 1) The Court was aware that the appellant failed to follow its usual due diligence requirement. 2) There would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed.","The appellant appealed his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the court accepting fresh evidence. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed. There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed. 1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission. 2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us. All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay. Any evidence sought to be adduced under the discretion of what is now s. 683 of the Code must be admissible evidence. With respect to the evidence of Ms. Brinkman, she does not swear that Ms. Bodkin was selling methamphetamine at the relevant time. 3) With respect to due diligence, it must be noted that the appellant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who represents him before this court. The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward. If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems. 4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered."
"The parties met, married, made children and then separated. The respondent father is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins. They have not settled a division of matrimonial property. Issues [1] What amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments? HELD: 1) The respondent's income is determined to be $29,983 and he shall pay the petitioner for the support of Reidar and Bronwyn, born December 1998 and the sum of $568 per month commencing October 1, 2005 and continuing every month thereafter until a child is no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 2) Personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses (vi, (vi) capital cost allowance on real property owned by the partnership; and (vii) Capital cost allowance are non-subsidized childcare and any health and medical costs in excess of $100 per annum. There is nothing to suggest the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is one of those files where it appeared that the holding of trial, in fact, was a more efficient and cheaper method of coming to conclusion regarding the issue of maintenance than ongoing negotiation or pre-trial. Each party achieved partial success in their approach and no costs were awarded to either party.","The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount."
"The applicant power company applied for summary judgment against the defendant, alleging that the applicant failed to supply coal under a Coal Supply Agreement. The Agreement contained four call options for the purchase and delivery of low Sulphur Coal in the amount of 100,000 tonnes. The applicant sought summary judgment for the failure to supply in quarters 2, 3 and 4 of 2004. The court refused to grant summary judgment in either quarter or quarter 4. The affiant was an expert retained by the applicant to provide an opinion with respect to the commercial reasonableness of the purchase of substitute coal by NSPI. The expert advised the applicant that he was unable to carry out the analysis due to the insufficiency of materials. After discovery, the discovery hearing took place in New York City in order to reduce some of the inconvenience and costs of conducting it in Colorado, United States of America, where the witness resides. This was done at the suggestion of the applicant's counsel. The Court was of the opinion that costs should be awarded at the rate of $2,000 per day for a total of $4,000 together with taxable disbursements for filing and the like.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant for failing to supply three of the four quarterly amounts of coal due pursuant to their contract. Following a two-day summary judgment application, the court granted judgment for one of the three quarters, with damages to be determined. Costs were at issue for the summary judgment application as well as a previous application brought by the defendant to compel document production. The defendant's application was resolved prior to being heard in Chambers, but only after discovery examination was held in New York. Costs awarded for the summary judgment application on the basis of $2,000 per day for a total of $4,000 (the plaintiff is not precluded from seeking further costs after damages have been determined), plus taxable disbursements; costs awarded on the defendant's application as a half-day Chambers application in the amount of $1,000, with the plaintiff to also pay the disbursements incurred by the defendant in filing the application; travel costs for the defendant's counsel to attend in New York; and the costs of preparation, travel, food and lodging for its expert witness to attend the discovery."
"This was an appeal from a Queen's Bench decision allowing this appeal and setting aside the order of the Chambers judge on the basis that he acted without any evidence that certain activities of the children were extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Federal Child Support Guidelines and that he failed to consider and apply the definition of'special and extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1) The chambers judge had the necessary evidence before him that he is required to consider to make his decision whether all, some, or none of the extracurricular activities should be considered 'extraordinary expenses' by the Court of Appeal. He did not make a palpable and overriding error nor did he err in law. There was no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chamber judge. 2) It is implicit in his conclusion that the increase in the income of the appellant, since the date of the consent order, constituted a material change of circumstance. He addressed the question of the extraordinary expenses in this one line in his judgment. He calculated the appellant's proportionate share and then ordered the appellant to pay 73% of the net day care costs and six specific extracricular activities. The costs may be estimated out of her income, including child support of $2,532 for the children. 3) The respondent argued that the chambers judge ought to be considered to have taken into account the total costs of all the activities, including day care, orthodontic treatments, the nature and number of activities, the special needs or talents of the child(ren), the overall cost of the activities and any other similar factor that the court considers relevant. 4) The Chamber judge referred only to the costs of Ashley's Tae Kwon Do and soccer, Mitchell's soccer, and Makayla's voice and soccer costs. The only issue on this appeal is the order that the appellant pay 73%. These expenses are covered by the basic child support order of $3,528 per year, which the respondent receives tax free. 5) The appellant is responsible for 73 per cent of all children's health care and day care expenses.","This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal."
"The plaintiffs sued the defendant corporation in a dispute note for recovery of the amount of $3,604.13. The defendant corporation was in the business of building decks and sunrooms and had been for 18 years. The plaintiff intended to construct a glass sunroom on the back of their home and had obtained a detailed quotation from the defendant for construction of a concrete pad and pillar system. When the defendant refused to supply the concrete pilings, the plaintiff and plaintiff filed a counterclaim for the sum of $2,200 to be paid by the defendants. The defendants then sued the plaintiff for counterclaims of misappropriation of funds and damages. HELD: The contract was frustrated. It was not reasonably forseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The court find that the supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Based on the facts as found in the case, a just and reasonable resolution demanded the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the breach of contract should be borne by the parties in a 65/35 ratio.","The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home. They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time."
"Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under s. 487.051(3) of s.C. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. HELD: Appeal allowed. Following the conviction the Court of Appeal is of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a whole—she has 53 prior convictions—and to have adequate regard for her objectives of s485.053 as identified in R. v. Briggs (2001), 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON CA), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made.","Fulltext of judgment follows: Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent. If any directions should be required in relation to the execution of the order, the parties are given leave to informally apply for such directions through the Registrar's office."
"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with operating while over.08 contrary to ss. 253(2) and 254(1(a) as well as with operating vehicles while his blood alcohol content exceeded.08. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The breach was not the result of wilful or blatant disrespect of the Charter by the officer nor was it a result of a wilful, blatant disrespect by the employer. There was nothing in the evidence to suggest that the officer wilfully or recklessly disregarded the rights of the accused. The officer was subjectively believed that he had reasonable grounds pursuant to s254(3) ofthe Code to arrest the accused for impaired driving and to make demand for breath samples. However, the officer subjectively thought that he could arrest the officer for impaired impaired driving, nor did he have the grounds to arrest for impaired drinking, thus the arrest was unlawful, the search was unlawful and the rights were violated. The Court held that there was no breach of s. 8 or s. 9 of the charter and that the admission of evidence would be beneficial to society. The issue was whether the officer reasonably could have only a mere suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The admission was not necessary to terminate the investigation. The Certificate of Analysis was not admissible.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded."
"FIAT: The defendant applied pursuant to Rule 41(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules for an order that this action and Tsatsi v. College of Physicians and Surgeons, Don McMorris and Sunrise Health Region, be tried together. HELD: 1) This is a defamation action based on statements that the plaintiff alleges were made by the defendant on June 1, 2009. The statements made specific allegations about the plaintiff's failure to properly read an x-ray, and also alleged that health officials knew the plaintiff should not be doing the work he was doing. The College Action is also a defamation suit. 2) The defendant has leave to amend his Statement of Defence. 3) Such words as were spoken or written by the defendants are true and the evidence in the College Action be evidence in this action. There is a risk of inconsistent findings if these matters are not tried together, or at the same time. Judicial economy is at stake.","The defendant applied pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 169 for leave to amend his Statement of Defence. This is a defamation action and the amendment would add that the words spoken by the defendant were true and that the alleged defamation was justified in law. The action relates to statements made about the plaintiff's failure to properly read an X-ray and his failure to pass certain certification exams and that health officials knew that he should not be performing the work he was doing. There is another defamation action, described in this judgment as the College Action. The defendant applied pursuant to Rule 41(2) that his action and the College Action be tried together because there are common issues of fact between the two, albeit different actions.  Trying them together would be in the interests of judicial economy and avoid the possibility of conflicting findings. HELD: The Court ordered that the two actions be tried one immediately after the other in the manner determined by the trial judge and that the defendant be given leave to amend his Statement of Defence."
"The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. They attended a French language school (École de Bellegarde) for the benefit of their children. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children's provisional permission to attend would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless children filed a complaint with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging that the school had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. In August of 2013 the plaintiffs, as represented by the lawyer, applied for an interlocutory injunction that would order the school to grant ongoing permission to the children to attend the school. On September 10, 2013 the defendant applied to strike the plaintiffs' statement of claim. HELD: The Court found that the plaintiffs’ claim was an abuse of process because the plaintiffs never applied for judicial review to set aside the appeal decision rendered by the elected directors of the CÉF and their failure to encourage the children’s learning in French and to encourage their participation in the French immersion program. The court found that s. 23 of the Charter gives it an exclusive and unfettered authority to decide whether it will admit any non-rights holders to attend a fransaskois school in Saskatchewan, and neither this Court nor the SHRC may inquire into its reasons or interfere with its discretion.  1) The Court reviewed the relevant caselaw in s. 25 of The Education Act and found that it would be impossible for the plaintiffs to demonstrate that they had not been discriminated against because of their disability. The Court awarded special damages to the plaintiffs for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the application to dismiss the claim, the cost of training and re-training the service dog, notwithstanding compensation that might otherwise be available to the plaintiff under the Animal Protection Act; and general damages for out of pocket expenses, travel expenses, expenses, costs of the training and refreshment for the children.","Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction."
"The original plaintiff issued his claim under The Class Actions Act for breach of consumer protection and sale of goods legislation, breach of warranty, negligence the Competition Act and waiver of tort. The claim seeks to recover damages on behalf of those who purchased the defendants' 'Low Sodium' beverages (the 'Class' or 'Class Members'), but ultimately received beverages which were no lower or not appreciably lower in sodium than other, non-Low Sodium beverages. The defendants claim that they should receive summary judgment in favour of their claim is clearly without merit. There is no evidence that the plaintiffs were misled about the sodium content of the drink they purchased, nor did they rely upon the low sodium label when making the purchase and find they did not suffer any damages. HELD: The application for summary judgment was granted. 1)The plaintiff admitted that the defendants had put two identical products on the market but labelled them differently. The facts are undisputed. The only reason to label and market identical products differently is to create the illusion that the identical products are different. 2)While there may be a genuine issue for trial, the Court will not hear a summary judgment application before having to decide the plaintiffs' application for certification. The Court will continue to consider the defence to summary judgment to dismiss the claim. 3)The Court will follow the judicial authority provided by the SCC in Hryniak v. Mauldin and consider if summary judgment is appropriate, whether genuine issue exists, whether its resolution requires conventional trial, and 4)whether the plaintiffs have simply misconstrued their own pleadings and seized upon what they believed was an admission that then emerged as the singular plank in their case.",HELD: The court granted summary judgment for the defendants. It held that it could determine the defendants’ application prior to the plaintiffs’ application for certification. The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages. The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence. There was no genuine issue requiring a trial. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them. It was not necessary to decide the application for certification.
"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the information provided by the respondent on which to direct an assessment of legal services outside of the 30 day time period was not sufficient to require the assessment. As well, the respondent’s affidavit was not based on personal knowledge and the respondent did not provide the required information. The respondent”s evidence did not establish that the respondent had any complaint about the services rendered or of any overvaluing or undervaluing of the services provided. The length of time between the appointment of a bill and the assessment was not a significant issue. However, the applicant was not entitled to rely on hearsay from former Chiefs and Council members confirming the quality and effectiveness of Brabant” s services during the time they were involved in with the respondent.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice. The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated."
"HELD: The Court found the petitioner’s Federal Child Support Guidelines to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support for D.K. in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal and child support of $5,250.00 per month. The petitioner had been residing in Regina for the past few years and claimed that shared parenting and an equal division of family home and property had been his primary motivation for moving to Canada. The respondent, he maintained, wanted him to remain in Canada but felt that, since he was self-employed, he was not able to afford it. As for the parties’ debts, the petitioner claimed that he had obtained an interest-free loan from the respondent that was used primarily to pay child care, education and travel expenses. He also claimed that the respondent was a better parent because she had taken more time off work and had been able to spend more time with him. The court found the respondent to have an income of approximately $309,700.00, which was approximately double the amount he earned in the previous two years, and attributed the increase in income to increased access by the respondent. The Court also found that there were other outstanding debts owing to the health region in Ontario, which the petitioner had not been aware of prior to the commencement of his residency in Canada. These debts were the subject of an answer and counter petition filed by the petitioner against the respondent in January 2015 against them both on the basis that they had unilaterally transferred their son to the province. HELD: 1) The respondent was granted access on the first three weekends of each month, as well as every Wednesday.  2) The Court ordered the respondent paid interim child tax benefits of $3,000 per month for the first two years. 3) The petitioner was awarded access on alternate weekends. 4) The court prohibited the respondent from removing the petitioner from the province for any length of time. 5) On a balance of probabilities, the respondent would not be able to support himself on an ongoing basis due to the nature of his practice. On balance, the court found that it would be difficult for the petitioner to continue living in the province if he was permitted to travel to visit his son in the U.S. Further, the Court found that if the respondent had continued to work and did not wish to return to the country, he would be entitled to a portion of the monies from the Ontario monies for the RQHR loan","HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period."
