1990canlii4096.txt,"This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","This was an application by the applicant for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against him in respect of charges prosecuted against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (I.D.A.). The application for certiorari was joined by an application for an order restraining the respondent from taking any further proceedings. HELD: Application for interim injunction granted. 1)The applicant was found guilty of professional misconduct.  2)The trial judge found that the American Cyanamid test was not applicable and that the court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very special circumstances.  3)The application for the interim injunction was quashed by the disciplinary panel."

For the appellant, that the trial judge failed to consider whether the knife fit the definition of a weapon under s.2 of the Criminal Code and, in addition, failed to satisfy himself that the accused intended to use the dagger to cause injury or death or for the purposes of threatening or intimidating. The matter was remitted for a new trial.","This was an appeal from a conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, a push dagger contrary to s.89(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge did not consider the definition of weapon as set out in s.2 of the Code. He founded the conviction solely on the basis the push dagger was concealed on the accused person.

The Court had overturned the convictions on the ground that the reverse onus provision of s.172, respecting the accuracy of the scale, violated s. 11(d) of the Charter. Allowing the appeal and restoring the convictions, that the trial judge did not rely on the prima facie effect of the Crown's evidence, but rather had ample evidence concerning the accuracy of the scales upon which to rely.","The respondents were convicted, after their trials, and fined for operating overweight vehicles on the Bedford Highway. The offence with which each was charged was a violation of the Motor Vehicle Act, then s. 172 of the Act and Regulations made pursuant to the Act. Dismissing the appeals, that there were no Charter issues in these appeals and that the summary conviction appeal judge erred in allowing the appeals on the basis of Charter violations. HELD: The appeal was granted. 1)The acquittal of each respondent was set aside and the conviction of each was convicted. 2)There may be cases where the defendants are able to advance evidence that causes a trial judge to rely on the prima facie effect of the Crown's evidence as stated in s. 174 (now s. 193). These three respondents do not fall in this category."
1994canlii5206.txt,"The Plaintiff, aged 72 years, claimed ongoing damages resulting from a whiplash injury suffered in a motor vehicle accident 5 years earlier. She had been involved in previous accidents and also suffered from osteoporosis and hypertension. She displayed some symptoms of mental illness, including paranoid delusions. HELD: The Plaintiff's evidence as to her condition was not accepted. Based upon the opinion of her doctor, the court found partial disability of 3 months, and that her symptoms were fully resolved within 1 year. The court awarded general damages of $18,000.00.  The court refused to award damages for loss of housekeeping capacity, given the Plaintiff's disability prior to the accident.","The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident. Liability was not in issue. The plaintiff suffered a whiplash injury which was substantially resolved over a period of about one year following the accident. She suffered from diabetes, osteoporosis and hypertension and suffered from delusions of paranoidal nature. Carpet cleaning expenses were allowed. The proper level at the time of the accident was $18,000.  1)No evidence was tendered in respect of her loss of housekeeping capacity as it would appear that she was substantially disabled prior to the accident or that the accident contributed to her being so confined at this time. 2)The proper level of damages was at that time at the defendant's expense. 3)The plaintiff's loss of homekeeping capacity was not found to be relevant. The Court did not accept any evidence tendered to the loss of her housekeeping ability as it was would appear shewas substantially disabled pre-accident. Such inconvenience as was suffered during the year following was adequately compensated by the non-pecuniary award."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation applied to set aside the default judgment on the basis of an interlocutory notice filed March 2, 1995. The matter was originally set down for Regular Chambers to be heard on March 9, 1995 and was subsequently adjourned to allow the defendant to file a defence in Nova Scotia. The defendant appealed. Dismissing the application, that the defendant had failed to establish any reasonable excuse for its failure to defend. The plaintiff had made a premature filing of a default judgment because the statement of claim had combined a request for declaratory relief with a claim for what I consider to be liquidated damages. It is difficult to see how the defendant was possibly prejudiced as it had already made it clear to the plaintiff that it was not going to file in Ontario."
1996canlii7150.txt,"FIAT. The defendant had been held in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. The issue here was responsibility for the legal costs incurred by the plaintiff to compel production. Her solicitor/client bill exceeded $50,000 including very large disbursements as a trustee was appointed to preserve the property and the defendant solicitor's files were seized. An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention. Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.  1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared. Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties. 2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge. It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs. It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","FIAT. The defendant was in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. When the third party order was sought, there appeared to be an urgent need to preserve the plaintiff's property. Trustees were appointed, and the files of Bawolin were seized. The plaintiff's solicitor/client costs to be taxed. HELD: 1)This was the more appropriate route in the circumstances.  2)Taxing the costs of the legal costs incurred by the defendant to comply with the plaintiff was the preferable route.  3)The Court would conclude, once the whole story is revealed, that the legal expenses incurred to enforce production are out of proportion to any gain which Siemens could reasonably have expected to achieve. Costs are left to the trial judge."
1997canlii1932.txt,"The plaintiff's leg was impaled for 25 minutes on an iron fence which he had attempted to climb for. He was treated at the emergency department of the Victoria General Hospital for an hour. He did not inform the doctors as to the length of time he had been impaled. Upon his release he was advised to watch for any infection. He was not issued antibiotics. The wound quickly worsened, and the plaintiff was forced to undergo surgery and a skin graft to repair his leg. He sued the doctors who initially treated him for negligence. Dismissing the action, that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way. While the defendants underestimated the nature and extent of the injury, they provided a recognized method of treatment based upon the knowledge they had. The real fault lies with the plaintiff who failed to reveal fully what had happened to him.",The plaintiff alleged negligence by the two defendants medical doctors and claims damages arising from the negligence. HELD: The plaintiff's case was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendants and each of them did not fall below the standard of care required of them in their treatment of the plaintiff. Further the plaintiff's loss is not attributable to any of the acts of the defendants but rather is the direct result of the injury he suffered. 2)The plaintiff's injuries were not caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way. The treatment was appropriate and within the type of performance expected of an emergency medicine specialist.

Despite poor upbringing, abuse at the hands of his stepmother, and being moved from many foster homes, the offender had completed high school and one year of university. There was a favourable pre-sentence report suggesting good prospects for rehabilitation, and a joint sentence recommendation for two years' imprisonment followed by two years probation with strict terms, including 180 hours of community service.

He had some talent and some motivation to become a productive member of the community. He would benefit from supervision following his release."
1999skqb29.txt,"In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent. The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings. The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","FIAT: The applicants seek an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development, including the subject bylaw, and from further considering an application for a discretionary use permit by Kathy and Gary Palidwar for a private hotel development connected with the community facility known as the Evergreen Centre. HELD: 1)The applicant's proceedings were not in the public interest and further, that the respondent had not met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting.  2)The applicants were hoteliers who operate five of the six hotels and motels within the community and who have joined together in an informal association. The proposal was not disclosed for two weeks. During that time no action was taken by the Council, although the members may have given thought to the proposal, something which they were entitled to do. 3)The respondent's proceedings in respect to the proposed hotel were not held in camera. 4)The court found nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal or the meetings 'in camera' as the Council's consequent action was made part of the public record. 5)The Court concluded that the Town Council did not conceal anything or attempt to do so.

2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The appellants appealed their summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal right to hunt for food, to the extent that it affected the appellants' 'Aboriginal rights' and/or 'Indianness' as defined in s. 8.1 of the Regulations. The purpose of the legislation was to ensure safety and not extinguish aboriginal rights. The appellants had failed to come within the provisions of s. 686(1)(a)(i) or (ii)of the Constitution. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellant’s aboriginal right and, if so, whether it is justifiable. The regulation applies to the appellant as hunters, not as Metis.  1)The trial judge reviewed the relevant authorities when considering interjurisdictional immunity. He found that notwithstanding s. 91(24), provincial laws of general application apply proprio vigore to Indians and Indians and their rights fall to be considered in a fashion to those “Indians” who took treaty lands pursuant to the Indian Act, 1906. The evidence showed that the appellant, like everyone else, were subject to the Saskatchewan regulation that prohibits night hunting with an artificial light except when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. 2)The appellant had not demonstrated that he or she was acting pursuant to an Aboriginal right. The focus has shifted to the limiting laws in both Aboriginal and Treaty hunting rights cases. The decision is necessary to apply the test established by Sparrow and expanded in the subsequent authorities. The safety purpose of this legislation is to preserve its constitutionality under the doctrines of division of powers and interjursal immunity. 3)It is not necessary to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. It is not unreasonable safety legislation. The only test that the trial judge applied was the Sparrow test. 4)The objective of the regulation was to protect the aboriginal right of the appellant and the Aboriginal group to hunt. The objective was primarally safety, both from the words used in the legislation and the evidence introduced. The appellant had demonstrated that they enjoyed hunting rights within the meaning of the Constitution Act, 1867. They were exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting in unoccupied crown land. 5)The"

The child is the petitioner's son from a prior relationship. The petitioner plans to have the child live with his biological father in Edmonton so that he can get the specialized medical care that he requires. When the petitioner and the respondent separated, they consented to a judgment, which granted the petitioner custody of the child and gave access rights to the respondent. The consent judgment provided that the petitioner was to provide the respondent with 90 days notice of any proposed change in the child's residence. Notice of the upcoming move was provided to the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. The consent judgment does not require the petitioner to get an order before changing the child's residence.

There was nothing in the judgment requiring the petitioner to obtain an order allowing her to remove the child from the Province of Saskatchewan until she obtains a Court order permitting her to do so. The respondent had agreed that it would be in the child's best interests to live with his biological father in Edmonton where help for the child was more easily accessible.

2008skqb33.txt,"The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules striking paragraphs of the amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the statement of claim to remain would be an abuse of process. The paragraphs of the amended statement of claim at issue deal with the fact that the plaintiff alleges he was assaulted by the defendant and sustained bodily harm. The defendant was charged with assault, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. The issue is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceedings on the subsequent civil proceedings. HELD: The paragraphs of the statement of claim at issue do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial is inadmissible in a subsequent civil trial as proof that the party did not commit the offence.  2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the Crown against the defendant, the Crown bore the onus throughout to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence did not apply and the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings. In the civil proceeding, the plaintiff is in a position to control the presentation of his case and must prove his case on a balance of probabilities. The onus of proving self-defence is on the defendant.

HELD: 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal proceeding is inadmissible in a subsequent civil proceeding as proof that the party did not commit the offence. The Court may at any stage of an action order any pleading or part thereof to be struck out, with or without leave to amend, on the ground that: it is otherwise an abusive process of the Court; and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly. 2) The Court reviewed the procedure to be followed on an application under Rule 173. It found that a conviction of an assault on a self-defence demonstrator bears a reasonable weight on the balance of probabilities. A conviction of assault on an accused in a civil proceeding bears a weight on a reasonable basis. 3) It is not necessary to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offence in order to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 4) The court found that the appellant's defence of self defence bore a weight throughout the entire process of relitigation. It did not say that the crown had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, or that it failed to show that the defendant did not act in self defence. The court held that the application to strike was not supported by the facts."
2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","The appellant sought a declaration to strike the appellant's claim under s. 36 of the Constitution Act, 1982, alleging that the Government of Nova Scotia had breached its commitment to the appellant. The appellant's pleadings did not disclose a reasonable cause of action. The court struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause. HELD: Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. 1)Civil Procedure Rule 14.25 provides for an action to be dismissed summarily, thus denying litigants their “day in court”. 2)The appellant’s proposed interpretation of s.36 embodies an agreement among the provinces and the federal government following a comprehensive negotiation process. While this commitment may be actionable at the instance of the province, it cannot be considered at the hands of municipalities such as the CBRM. The normal standard on an application to strike is whether the appellant has put conflicting interpretation 'worth considering' or whether it has committed an appealable error. 3)If the appellant successfully appeals the decision to strike its claim, the Court will retain jurisdiction to decide whether the claim should be converted to an action."
2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.","This is an application under Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order in the nature of mandamus compelling the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The respondent is disabled and has been a long term recipient of income assistance benefits from the Department of Community Services. His assistance was terminated in May 2006 due to failure to disclose requested information. He re-applied for income assistance in may 2007. His application was again denied based on failure to provide requested information; the regulations also confirm the Respondent has no discretion, either as to whether the decision is binding generally or as to the time period effected. The Board allowed the appeal and found that the applicant was 'a person in need' as defined in the Employment Support and Income Assistance Act (ESIA). The Board ordered that his assistance was to be effective the date that he was assessed. HELD: The application for mandamus was granted. The Court found that there was a clear legal right established to have the decision of the Appeal Board enforced. Regulation 36 was designed to apply to procedural matters where the appeal board perhaps made an order providing for benefits in excess of that allowed by the Act and the Committee would adjust the benefits to fit the legislation. The board so erred, the respondents argue, that the provisions of regulation 36 would apply and that the Director and the Social Services Committee were bound by that decision and are entitled to implement that decision subject to any action the Committee might take to question the Board's decision. However, the Department continues to refuse to reinstate eligibility from June 27 to September 7 as period covered by the Order of the Assistance Board."
2010skpc153.txt,"The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations. The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch. The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one. The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations. The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door. The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts. It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue.",The accused was charged with seven counts related to his conviction under s. 13(1) of the Fisheries Regulations for the offence of exceeding the angling limit. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1)There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of s. 27 of The Fisheries Act. The Crown has conceded that Kevin Callele is not a member of the Executive Council. The issue is whether the Minister of Environment had the authority to revoke the accused's licence and prohibit him from applying for or obtaining a licence at the relevant times. 2)The accused did possess a fishing licence. He acted in compliance with that licence. There was no valid section 27 revocation or prohibition in place so far.

The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Court granted leave and allowed the appeal in judgment from the bench. HELD: The conviction was upheld and the appeal was allowed. 1) The Court found that the trial judge did not err in his decision to use pepper spray in the complainant’s defence. He did not direct himself to all of the relevant evidence resulting in a reviewable error. He focused on the fact there were two officers present and did not address the fact that the complainant had his finger in his face twice. 2) The trial judge reviewed the evidence of the three witnesses and concluded that the appellant reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and that the use of pepper spray was not proportionate. 3) An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply on the basis that the judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others. The failure on the part of trial judge to find a mistake of fact to be'reasonable' was not an unreasonable finding. The court found that even if the appellant had been afraid, he would have rejected the defence of self-defence based on the assessment of the options available to him in the context of what he was facing and whether the force used by the appellant was justified."
2_1999canlii12455.txt,"The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support. Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","The primary issue between the parties is custody of their four children. Ancillary to and dependent upon determination of the custody issue, is the quantum of child support that will be payable by either party. Matrimonial property owned by the parties at the time of separation has largely been divided between them to their mutual satisfaction, with the exception of few items to be dealt with by way of court order. Both parties agreed that the application for custody proceed pursuant to the counter-petition. HELD: The children were to reside in the joint custody of the parties and that they reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. 1) The court must take into consideration only the best interests of the children as determined by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of those children. 2) The Court must consider the interests of each party. The child should reside primarily with the mother. 3) It is not in the children's best interests that they be removed from an environment that offers them the stability that they require nor from the specialized educational opportunities available to them in Saskatoon. 4) The evidence demonstrated that the children were not doing well academically, socially, emotionally, physically or sexually. 5) There was no evidence of the increased costs of shared custody such that consideration could be given to s. 9(b) of the Guidelines. The evidence would be at best an estimate of the future cost of the new arrangement and necessarily lacking in precision."
2_1999canlii12554.txt,"FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage,and in the alternative a variation in access. The father counter applied for interim custody. The parties agreed in 1997 that the father should have interim custody. The mother argued that she was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization for unipolar/clinical depression. The father had been employed as a long distance trucker but now worked days in the city. HELD: The applications for custody were dismissed. Overnight access was granted to the mother. 1)The application ignored the consistent law which states the courts should not vary interim custody arrangements whether legal or de facto in the absence of evidence that the child(ren) are in some way at risk, or other compelling reason. It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. The non-primary care parent should proceed to final order which in this provicne means obtaining a pre-trial date for a pre-trial conference and proceed to trial if custody is not resolved at that stage. 2)The court was satisfied on the basis of a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health was stable that the child was not at risk if the mother were granted overnight access.","FIAT.

2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","HELD: The respondent was awarded judgment for $1,945 plus an award of costs of $5,000. 1)The respondent was employed by the public school system and had a permanent job. He had the prospect of an inheritance from his mother, a good pension, his own home with no mortgage and in short no financial problems.  2)The matrimonial home was, prior to the 21 month marriage between the parties, the long term family home of Sharon Lang and her 10 children all born of a previous marriage. The respondent had assumed debts of almost $5k of which $2,500 must be credited to him leaving a credit to Sharon of $6,690. 3)The Court accepted the claim that the respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother as protection 'in case he meets someone' is exempt property. 4)The court accepted that the claim was in its entirety inequitable and had it not been for an extraordinary circumstance it would have been unfair and inequitable to do so having regard only to any extraordinary circumstance; or unfair and unfair to the spouse who has custody of the children."

Leave to appeal was granted with respect to whether the Committee erred in making an order respecting issues not raised by the notice of intention to appeal; in ruling the assessed value cannot be increased where the board orders correction of errors in the assessment; if not, whether the Committee erred in jurisdiction in failing to apply s.263.2 of the Urban Municipality Act.

Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower. The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D & S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence. It is alleged that the defendant failed to perform as agreed and in consequence the plaintiff seeks damages. The defendant resists the claim and by way of a counterclaim seeks judgment for extras requested by the plaintiff.

The plaintiff was liable to pay for the work. 3)The cost of the extras were to be treated as an extra over and above the contract price to be paid to the defendant."
2_2001nssc171.txt,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to clause 15.10 of the lease quashed. The lease contained an arbitration clause which prohibited the use of force majeure clauses. The tenant argued that the arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and that the decision of a consensual arbitrator, protected by a privative clause, immune from judicial review, even if patently unreasonable. HELD: 1) The arbitrator was not limited to interpreting the words in the lease but could deal with the issues of insurance coverage and whether insurance should cover the damage. The principles of waiver and estoppel apply as against the Tenants. 2) The arbitration clause under the lease is a limited arbitrator. It does not provide that all disputes between the parties are to be settled by arbitration, but only disputes with regard to clauses or provisions of a lease. There is no jurisdiction to resolve a claim such as this which arises from the Landlord/Tenant relationship itself and not the clauses and provisions of the Lease. 3) It was incorrect in assuming jurisdiction to apply the principle of estoppelle against the tenants. 4) The standard of review is correctness with respect to the issue of jurisdiction. 5) It would be inequitable for strict rights to be upheld where the party now setting up the estoppela has relied upon the actions and statements of the parties to his detriment. 6) There is a clear case of an error in law, assuming there was one, was within the learned arbitrator's jurisdiction, but the same could be said for statutory tribunal. 7) The court should not interfere with the award. 8) It is not necessary to add parol evidence about the meaning of the clause to the decision. 9) The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Vancouver was not the only one which dealt with this issue. The Court of Appeal in Vancouver has adopted the reasoning of the same arbitrator (who was awarded $318,252.00 for repairs and $59,130.34 for loss of rental opportunity) and the Court of Queen's Bench in Vancouver adopted the reasons of Lambert, J.A. (p. 35 Appeal Book, Volume 1). The court of justice in Vancouver is not satisfied that the principles of curial deference, which was used in the Vancouver decision, apply to this case. 10) The award of damages is beyond the scope of arbitration clause because it is not dispute about the clauses or provision of the LEase.

2_2004nssf92.txt,"The husband applied to have the wife's application for retroactive child support to cover the costs of the child's post-secondary education struck as a matter more properly addressed as an issue of contract. In addition to the child support ordered in the Corollary Relief Judgment, the husband had signed a document in which he agreed to repay the costs of the daughter's American student loans (which had to be obtained in the wife's name as the wife was an American). The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation. Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'. There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties.","The applicant brought an application pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 14.25 to strike out the applicant’s application. While she cited various forms of relief, the application was retroactive. The applicant sought a variation in relation to spousal support and a retroactive child support order. She also sought declaratory relief, exemplary or punitive damages and costs. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) There was ample evidence before the Court to determine that there has been material change in circumstances since the signing of the separation agreement. No agreement can be unilaterally changed. 2) The only factor advanced in support is the applicant daughter of the parties’ agreement. The need for additional educational funding was within the parties contemplation in 1996 and was provided for in their agreement. 3) The applicant had complied with his child support obligation as set out in the corollary relief judgment and there was nothing to enforce. The court found that the applicant had not breached her rights under the Corollary Relief Act. 4) The application to strike the application succeeds. The application is an effort to either enforce the corollaary relief or in the alternative to retroactively vary the child support provisions. Only if the action is certain to fail because it contains a radical defect should it be struck. 5) There is ample evidence to determine this action is a matter of contract. The only issue is whether the applicant has complied with her child support obligations. The first aspect of the application seeks to strike this application. It is well established that variation, either retroactively or prospectively, requires material change. In effect, something must have occurred that was not in the parties knowledge or contemplation at the time of the last order. In this case, the change must be a material change of circumstances. This means change, such that, if known at the relevant time it would likely have resulted in different terms. In the event the parties cannot agree on quantum, will accept submissions."

By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action. In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs. Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609.","FIAT. By fiat of May 27, 2004, the defendants in the action were entitled to examine a representative of 609 for discovery and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for the plaintiff. HELD: 1) The plaintiff and the defendants who have status in the proceedings and not Henry in his personal capacity nor the board of directors of the company in such an action, have been authorized the initiation of derivative action by the plaintiff on behalf of the defendants. As a corporation may only litigate with legal representation, the plaintiff is empowered and obliged to have counsel for 609. The nature of the action is such that Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of the 609 as he is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. The issue of cost of production of documents for the statement as to documents is presently to be resolved in the same manner as set out above dealing with costs generally. 2) The questions raised raised by the participants in their written submissions demonstrate confusion and misunderstanding as to the nature, nature and responsibilities of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action.  3) The question posed was whether there was any right of privilege as between 609 and Henry; if so, how is it claimed and are such documents privileged as between the Plaintiff and Defendants? Who is responsible for the cost of the production of any documents? 4) The court reviewed the existing rules of court and the applicable jurisprudence and determined that the action was a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff 609 proceeds for the benefit of the plaintiff against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Such counsel was entitled to access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the actions, including preparation of a statement of documents and following the modified discovery process set out in my earlier fiat. 5) These questions were capable of resolution utilizing analogous proceedings without doing violence to fundamental principles in the litigation process. 6) There was no order as to costs. The plaintiff was and was 609; the defendant was and is a corporation. The action remains derivative one and the respondent corporation should not at this time be required to fund the action; if leave is granted, the applicant gains the right e.g. to bring an action on the company's behalf.

The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent, a resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and was sentenced to nine months with a 10 year firearms prohibition.

2_2008nsca28.txt,"The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The respondent Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) appealed its decision denying the worker's claim for recognition because the workplace stressors experienced by the worker were not 'usual and excessive in comparison to those experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation'. The appellant argued that the Policy did not narrow the workplace law and that such an approach was the correct one, both under Policy 1.3.6 and under the general law applying to GECA claims in Nova Scotia. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Policy does not address the issue of whether the workplace events or stressors in the workplace are compensable under GECA. The Policy sets out certain work-related events that are non-compensable. These include the absence of work related events such as 'routine employment related actions' and 'labour relations issues'. WCAT did not err in relying on traumatic onset stress decisions to support its position. 2) There was no inconsistency within the policy in determining the claimant's gradual onset stress claim. The policy sets out the objective facts that are relevant to determining if the claimant suffered a compensable accident under the GECA; 3) There is no inconsistency in WCAT's approach to assessing the nature of workplace events and stressors from an objective point of view. WCAT correctly decided that there had been work- related events or stressful events that were unusual and excessive viewed objectively, that is, in comparison with those experienced in an average person in a similar occupation. The Court reviewed the state of the law at the Tribunal level at that time and found that the policy is declaratory of the principles to be applied in this regard to all stress claims. The Appeal Commissioner's reasoning process was unreasonable in that, having found there were unusual or excessive stressors at the workplace, there was some inconsistency within WCAT concerning whether an objective or subjective approach should be taken to assessing them. This requirement, now embodied in the Board Policy, set out the principles that apply in the context of GECA, and the Court found that WCAT applied it unreasonably to the claimant’s situation. 3) WCAT relied, in part, on two decisions dealing with traumatic onset trauma, Logan v. Nova Scotia (WCB) in 2005 and 2006 NSCA 29 (CanLII), released concurrently. The court reviewed the evidence in both decisions and reviewed the standard by which we should review these questions on appeal. The decision of the Appeal Commissioner was not inconsistent with the standard set out in the Policy. 4) The"
2_2008nssm4.txt,"The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined. The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","This is an appeal from an order of the Director dated December 13, 2007. That order allowed the Tenant the sum of $787.50 against the Landlord as compensation arising from what the Director found to be a breach of the statutory condition to provide a premises suitable for habitation. The Landlord did not attend the hearing before the Director. It appears that she missed it inadvertently, and she appeals to this Court against the findings. The two versions of the facts were as far apart as they could be. The Director detected mould and the conditions that allowed mould to develop. He then recommended a dehumidifier be placed in the basement. The Tenant moved out and brought this application for compensation. HELD: 1) The Court found on a strong balance of probabilities that there was no mould and that the bylaw inspector's findings did not contribute to the damages. 2) The damages were a little higher than originally estimated. It was impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint. Having heard and assessed her as credible, also find it hard to believe she would have engaged in such a tactic. Having reviewed the Director's evidence entirely, the Court concluded that she was not credible and her explanation was not probable. The Court also found that the Director was essentially correct in giving the plaintiff the damages amount of $862.50."

Defendant sentenced to fine of $25,000, from which the sum of $15,000 shall be paid to the Canadian Farmers' Disability Registry; defendant ordered to perform 160 hours of community service with respect to farm safety. The defendant was an individual and not a huge corporation, had been conscientious about safety issues prior to this incident and had endeavored to improve safety at his farm after the incident; the deceased had also failed in his responsibilities under the Act and was working with a significant blood alcohol content.","The defendant, who owned and operated a family dairy farm, pleaded guilty to an offence under the Occupational Health and Safety Act for failing to take every precaution that is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons at the workplace. The defendant's guilty plea relates to the fact that on August 13, 2006, one of his employees, Gary Boake, died in an accident at the farm that did not have a barrier. HELD: A total penalty of $25,000 was appropriate. 1)A sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances but this case does not lend itself easily to comparisons. 2)The defendant's failure was in not securing the manure pit which had its damaged barricade removed while a new one was on order, or not arranging for an alternative to use the pit, alternatives that did exist on the farm at the time. 3)The farmer's responsibility to safeguard his employees from risks associated with that manure pit arose under s.13(1) of the Health and safety Act and was a significant penalty for the defendant."

The Crown alleged that the trial judge erred in law by excluding two breath samples taken following the respondent's arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter of Rights. During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence. HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered. The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter. The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted as a full exhibit and became part of the Crown's case. The Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt in all respects.","The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the respondent on the charge of impaired driving on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed and this appeal will proceed on the evidence that the learned trial judge erred in law in excluding two breath samples taken after the arrest of Mr. Knoedler. The Court found that the trial judge failed to consider the contradictory evidence available to the police officer in forming the objective grounds for the demand sufficient to require additional objective information, such as if the demand was reasonable and the issue was pursued at the hearing of this appeal."

The mother was the successful party and income was imputed by the court to the respondent.  Held, costs in the amount of $3,000 are awarded against the father. The father's position caused unnecessary time, effort and delay. The court referenced L. (N.D.) v. L. (M.S.) (2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77. Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs.","The respondent was awarded costs of $3,000 following separate custody and child support hearings on October 25, 2011 and June 20, 2012 respectively. On the important parenting issue, the evidence established that the respondent was the appropriate primary care parent. The respondent's initiative in seeking to vary the existing order was not reasonable and responsible. The court imputed an income level to the respondent that was prepared to accept prior to the commencement of the hearing ($25,000). Costs were assessed against the respondent. The parties litigated the apportionment of custody and access rights and the quantification of child support and special expenses for their two children. HELD: Costs were awarded at a rate of $5,138.00 inclusive of HST and disbursements. A costs award was not included in the costs award. Costs awarded at the outset were to be based on the tariffs and not on the total income. Costs are in the discretion of the Court. The decision not to award costs must be for a very good reason and be based upon principle. The tariff is reproduced following Rule 77.18. Costs of $1,000 are assessed against a party. They are payable at rate of 1:150 per month until paid in full, commencing December 1, 2012. The Court reviewed the relevant rules and regulations and determined that: 1) the tariff is the governing tariff for the purpose of determining an appropriate costs award; 2) the tariffs are applicable to the amount involved in determining an award of costs; 3) there is no substitute for the tariff in determining a lump sum award; 4) costs are awarded based on an application of Scale of Tariff 'A' of the Costs and Fees Act, supra. The tariffs are reproduced following Rules 77.17. The amount involved was within the range of $40,000 ‑$65,000.” The respondent was subject to significant financial hardship at the time."

The trial judge failed to address this evidence, thereby committing a palpable and overriding error.","This was an appeal by the young offender who was convicted of nine charges of break and enter and one charge of assault. The Youth Court judge found that if the evidence of the appellant's sister and girlfriend was accepted, then the inducement was clearly established, and the Crown would have failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements were voluntary. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial was ordered. 1) The failure by the trial judge to make any finding with respect to this issue was, in my opinion, a palpable and overriding error. 2) Evidence of a similar nature was given by the girlfriend. The trial judge did not make any findings of fact or determinations of credibility on this essential matter. 3) The evidence dealing with the statements allegedly made by the appellant and his girlfriend was not admissible if it was voluntary. 4) There was something conveyed to the appellant that would have caused him to consider whether by giving a written statement he could give benefit to his girlfriend. If the evidence was not established, the Crown in my view would not have failed. 5) The appellant was accompanied throughout throughout by M.G., an adult of his choice, and for substantial period of time, his sister Coughlin. 6) There were other issues which could have influenced the decision. The appellant had not expressed his anger towards the police and felt that they would beat the charge anyway. 7) The respondent's sister's evidence was raised during the course of her cross-examination and also confirmed in her responses to questions from the Court."

She relied upon Civil Procedure Rules 15.07 and 15.08. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's application was an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of past circumstances of the child rather than an assessment of her current circumstances. The proper remedy would be for the applicant to apply for a termination of the order under s. 48 of the Children and Family Services Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of a Family Court judge declining to rescind an order in 1993 for permanent care and custody of the appellant's granddaughter. The basis on which the application was made was that the appellant consented to or agreed with the 1993 order on the faith of the agency's then plan of care which envisaged that an adoption plan would be initiated by the appellant. Unfortunately, the agency lost confidence in the child's parenting skills and by June 1995 was hospitalized. The appellant's husband reported the problem to the agency it sought intervention because he alone could not care for the child. He sought rescission of the order in question on the authority of Civil Procedure Rules 15.07 and 15.08.

3_1999skqb140.txt,"An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","This is an action by Redhead Equipment against Standard Transportation Services and Hyndman Transport (1972) Limited with respect to amounts owing for payments on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by the plaintiff to these leased vehicles. HELD: The action was dismissed. The facts did not satisfy the court on a balance of probabilities that this was an appropriate circumstance for an award in favour of the plaintiff based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.  1)There was no specific contract with regard to the repair of the leased vehicles, it was clear that the defendant did make some payments on behalf of Standard and for the repairs to them. 2)The plaintiff's claim on this ground was dismissed as there was no evidence of any contractual breach between the parties. 3)The facts of this case do not satisfy me on a balanced of probabilities on the issue of an award. This is not the case to make awards to plaintiff in circumstances where, although there may not be strict legal obligation by the defendant to pay monies, it would be unjust not to make an award to the plaintiff. 4)Costs were also dismissed. Although there was a specific contract, the plaintiff's evidence did not establish that the defendants had notice of the invoices, or that there had been a purchase order number obtained from the defendant authorizing the repairs. The evidence indicates that the payments by the defendants did not appear to be made under the direction of Bennett or for work that was done where specific purchase order numbers were supplied by Hyndmans. 5)The court dismissed the claim on the ground that there may have been a risk to the arrangement because of Standard's insolvency and that Redhead might not be paid on its trucking contracts. The defendant did not carry any liability for any breach of a contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. The actions taken by both parties were taken for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  6)Although there may be a contractual obligation between the defendant and plaintiff, the defendant has never been able to prove that a risk exists between contractual parties. There may be some evidence of some contractual breach associated with the repairs but there may never be a proof of such a risk.  7)The evidence of the defendants was clear from Cox's notes and Duda's evidence at trial that they did not know how the repairs were authorized for Standard. 8)The defendant knew at that meeting that the plaintiff was prepared to assume that risk."
3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of his cattle getting into the plaintiff's canola field late July, 1999. The defendant admits that his cattle were in the plaintiff’s crop on one occasion but admits that there was no evidence that his cows were in it on any other occasion. HELD: Judgment was granted in the amount of $2,533.45 together with pre-judgment interest from January 2000 and costs. 1)Under the present s.27 of the Stray Animals Act, the cattle owner is strictly liable for damage caused by his cattle. 2)Under both the present and pre-1977 s.s.27s the liability for crop damages may be absolute. The cattle owner was strictly responsible for the damage to his farm. The fact remains that the cattle did move onto the farm unbeknownst to the defendant, his spouse, his brother or his hired help. The Carrot River did not prove to be an impediment to the cattle’ ability to move. 3)Wildlife damage was minimal. 4)The plaintiff was awarded costs."

HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired. The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients. 3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice. 4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants. The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods. 5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","The applicant sought interlocutory injunctive relief framed in argument. HELD: The application was granted. The injunctions were requested on a quia timet basis and to enforce what the applicant says are restrictive covenants, obligations of confidentiality and fiduciary duty binding on the respondents.

After two years, the relationship between the Respondents and the Mother broke down and she left their home. The Respondents sought and were granted custody of the child. The Mother appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Respondents had sufficient interest under s.6 of The Children's Law Act to seek custody of the child. 2)The trial judge correctly determined that the only issue was the child's best interests, even in a contest between a parent and a stranger, although the parent/child relationship was one factor to be considered. 3)The findings of the trial judge were strongly supported by the evidence, the law was correctly applied, and therefore his decision ought not be overturned. 4)The matter was returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access.","The appellant, who is mentally handicapped, appeals the entrusting of custody of her 5 year old son to the respondents. The child and his mother were placed with the appellant and the respondents pursuant to Family Support Services Contract whereby the Harrises were to'spend individual time with' the appellant in supervising and teaching her to properly care for the child and provide for his needs. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs and the matter returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access. 1)The respondents had'sufficient interest' within the meaning of s.6 of The Children's Law Act and therefore status, a decision with which, as noted, the trial judge then had to decide the issue of custody. 2)The court's role is not to determine broad social issues but instead, to determine what custodial arrangement is in the child's best interest. This rule prevails even in contests between a natural parent and a stranger. The parental tie between mother and child is, of course, not to be ignored in such a contest. It is taken into account by the judge when considering the factors outlined in paragraph (i) of clause (8). The trial judge's error as to the categorization of the appellant as needing level care when in fact the level is funding level and not 'care' level is not material as there exists other strong evidence, including that of the court appointed psychologist, as to concerns about the mother's ability to care for her child, and the risk to the child if he is left unsupervised for extended periods of time in her care."

The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions. The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue. The mother sought sole custody with generous access. The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication. Allowing the mother's application, that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say. Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues. As the parties lacked flexibility, a detailed access plan was incorporated.","The parties were married for fourteen years and had two children, Conor and Braden.

The father seeks equal parental control and responsibility by an order for joint custody under s16(4) of the Divorce Act. The mother seeks to be the final decision maker in matters relating to the children's welfare, growth and development while being prepared to promote maximum contact between the children and their father to the extent that this is consistent with the best interests of the children. HELD: 1)The present joint custody arrangement is not working on a day-to-day decision making basis. The children have had the benefit of one parent's concentrated focus and the ability to make their scheduled activities the necessary focus during the week nights they are with the father. This pattern so far has not been the 'occasional resort' to the court referred to by Wilson in Krugger v. Krugger (1980), 1979 CanLII 1663 (ON CA), 11 R.F.L.

The order provided that when the husband retired, the wife would receive, as her vested share of his pension, 40% of his benefit. The order also provided that the parties could apply for further directions as necessary. After the husband's retirement, the wife sought to receive her share of the pension from the employer as a lump sum. The husband objected, claiming that he was entitled to any remaining benefit from her share in the event she should predecease him. The wife applied for directions.

She is also entitled to leave her interest in the pension to a named beneficiary, without reference to or the consent of the husband.","The parties married in 1952 and were divorced in 1984.

The University of Regina pension plan was divided as follows: (a)The share vested in the applicant was 40% of the total pension; (b)The applicant would like to receive her vested interest as a lump sum benefit; (c)The pension plan arrangement to be something of tontine was based on a comparative history of their two families; (d)On her death he expects to outlive his former wife and regain the remainder of the pension asset; (e)The parties applied for further clarification of their intentions. The court prefers to treat the application as one for an order interpreting the previous order, and consequential declarations and directions. Paragraph 14(a) provides that the applicant is to receive 'a vested interest in the pension to the extent described in this order'. The order provided for vesting to the applicable extent as described in the order does not contemplate joint ownership or any implied right of survivorship.

4_1996canlii6841.txt,"The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax. Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications. The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately. The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board of Revenue Commissioners reversed. 1)The Board determined that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use in Saskatchewan and there was evidence before the Board upon which it was open to them to come to that conclusion. 2)The assessment pertains to charges incurred by the Appellant in contract with Valtek Controls Ltd. of Alberta. The purchase of the drawings was an independent transaction and was exempt from tax by virtue of s. 8(1)(f) of the Act. The purpose for which the documents were produced, distributed or made available was not to be 'published' as provided for in the Act but rather solely for educational, technical, cultural or literary purposes. 3)The definition adopted by the Board does not give rise to the artificiality noted earlier i.e. determining whether a technical paper is produced and distributed to a sufficiently broad audience is a question of law open to review by this Court. 4)The board's definition adopted does not appear to be consistent with the statutory requirements set out in s. 21 of the Revenue and Financial Services Act. Having said that, the Board's definition of 'publish' in this context is not directed at the purpose of the documents but rather consistent with their intended purpose. 5)It is not necessary to comment upon the broad interpretation of the broad definition. The appeal is allowed."

The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the decision of an adjudicator made following a hearing pursuant to s. 62.1 and 62.2 of The Labour Standards Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts, as he found them. In addition, his findings of fact cannot be said to be 'patently unreasonable' because there was some evidence before him on which he could arrive at the same conclusion. The appeal based on the submission that the respondent had frustrated or breached her employment contract, thereby releasing Cajon from any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice, was dismissed. 2)Cajon acted well within his jurisdiction when determining what the terms of Ms. Kovach's employment contract were and that the employer had not fulfilled obligations thereunder. Although not all of the facts presented to him were known to this Court, his decision outlines some evidence upon which his conclusions could have arrived at his conclusions."
4_1999skqb3.txt,"The plaintiff was the coordinator of post-secondary education programs for White Bear First Nation, between 1990 until his termination in May 1997. The plaintiff managed post-secondary programs with an annual budget of $960,000, taught upgrading and university entrance courses, and supervised other teaching and support staff. In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs. There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict. The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct. The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal. The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause. HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed. The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct. There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance. The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract. Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed. Although the plaintiff had been treated unfairly, the plaintiff had not shown that the employer was guilty of harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious conduct.",HELD: The plaintiff was awarded damages for wrongful dismissal. The onus of proving the existence of just cause always lies with the employer and it is not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the employee or dissatisfaction with his or her job performance.
4_2000canlii2523.txt,"The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval. In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","The applicant land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval. The next day, the application was determined to be incomplete for essentially two reasons: 1) it failed to meet the newly incorporated road standards and 2) one of the bearings on the plan was missing. The Municipality relied on s. 278 of the Municipal Government Act in its submission that the higher road standards represented a major obstacle for the applicant. The applicant took issue with the development officer's decision to declare the application incomplete and sought a declaration that the application for final subdivision plan approval was complete. The development officer had a different interpretation of the plan. HELD: The application was incomplete. It was set aside. 1) the applicant was entitled to a declaration of the application is complete (again subject to non-contentious error in the plan).  2) The applicant met all applicable conditions of s. 283 and therefore the plan'shall' be approved. The developer relies on the grand-parenting section of the municipal Government Act. It is significant that the right of appeal is from a refusal. The mere existence of another potential remedy is not enough to deny mandamus.  3) the Municipality erred in law in finding it incomplete."
4_2001nsca26.txt,"The appellants pled guilty to theft over $5,000. The Crown and the defence put forward a joint sentencing recommendation of two years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount of the fraud, which was all that the appellants had actually retained. The sentencing judge ordered full restitution. The appellants appealed; the Crown conceded that the appeal should be allowed. Allowing the appeal, that while the agreement reached by the Crown and the appellants was not binding upon the sentencing judge, the joint recommendation was a fit sentence; in the circumstances there was no sound reason for departing from it.","The appellants pleaded guilty to fraud over $5000 and were sentenced by the Crown to two (2) years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount of the fraud. The Crown and defence advanced a joint sentencing recommendation for 2 years probation, restitution of 1/2 of the overpayment and a restitution order against the paymaster who was to be before the courts shortly. The appellants applied for leave and, if granted, appeal the judge's decision to order restitution of the full amount rather than one half as submitted in the joint recommendation. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was allowed. The restitution orders were amended by reducing the amounts ordered to be repaid by one half. The court granted leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. While the agreement reached between counsel and counsel was of course, not binding on the judge, it was a fit sentence. The joint recommendation was accepted by the judge and ordered restitution of half of the total amount of overpayment."
4_2005nspc10.txt,"The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and cocaine for the use of trafficking both under s.5(2) and s.2 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. There had been prior mischief complaints from the public regarding activity on the wharf and the officers approached several youth standing near vehicles. One of the youth approached the officers and asked who owned the vehicle. The officer indicated that he was going to search the vehicle for liquor and then found a large amount of cash in the back seat of the vehicle cooler. When the officer went to move a knapsack on the floor to check for further liquor, it felt heavy and he further could feel what he thought might be bottles contained within. When he returned to the vehicle, he found a backpack containing cash and a knappingack. The knapsacks were found in the vehicle console and the defendant had a knappedack with him, which he placed at his feet in the front passenger seat. The police officers seized the backpack and at subsequent search at the police station it was found to contain three rolls of cash. HELD: The accused was guilty of all three charges. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from all of the evidence before the court is not only that it was in the personal possession of the defendant but that it contained items of such a personal nature, because the cocaine the defendant handed to Hyslop came from the knapsock and because no one else had access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all of its contents and consented to their being there. There was no change in his identity. There were no changes in his hands or movements in the hands of the other person. The cash was in his pocket when he left the vehicle and was found in his wallet when he entered the vehicle to purchase beer. He had control of the bag and its contents until he went to leave the motor vehicle. There is no evidence that he changed his hands. There are no other items in the car that can be found in a vehicle."

The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government sought an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of The Queen's Bench Rules requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and in default of so doing striking the offending portions of the statement of claim. HELD: In the circumstances, the court was not prepared to strike the phrases complained of. The conduct of the Government was clearly and clearly defined by Rule 19(24) of the British Columbia Rules of Court. The Government was entitled to know the case it had to meet.  1) The pleadings do not lay foundation for the claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The defendant failed to identify the legislative scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government.  2) The court was satisfied that the Government is entitled to the case to meet and was not obliged to provide further particulars.  3) The Government failed to provide particulars to the parties involved in the action. The court found that it was essential for the Plaintiff to reference with particularity the statutes and regulations on which he relies in order for it to properly defend the action and not be taken by surprise. 4) The Court found that there was no evidence the Government put its own interests ahead of those of the plaintiffs in this case. It was also satisfied that, once the Government knew that the pleadings were proper, the Government could proceed with its own case."
4_2006skca76.txt,"The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","This was an appeal from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation, the father paid some maintenance for the child and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend month with him, as well as the summer holiday with him. The mother filed an affidavit denying all of the allegations and in particular, that she was an alcoholic and that her alcoholism adversely affected the child. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the order set aside. The father had leave to reapply on proper evidence if so advised. There was no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was either alcoholic and/or lack of proper care, there should have been an order directing trial of an issue rather than a decision made on the written evidence filed."
4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine at Rocanville, Saskatchewan. HELD: The claim is dismissed. The defendant was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff and did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to profit margins, etc. of the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not submit a proposal to the defendant. The only remaining issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal. The trial judge erred in characterizing the plaintiff's actions as mere preparation. An employee who submitted a bid for a food services contract in competition to her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of her employment contract. However the B.C. Court of Appeal held that an employee is under an implied obligation not to compete with an employer during the term of his or her employment. Although Sullivan had given notice that he would no longer work for the plaintiff after September 30th he was still employed at the time he made his proposal. He did not have the experience suggested by Fortney but I do not consider that to be confidential information. If there had been electricians available through the union hall they could have undertaken the work being performed by Sullivan."
4_2009skqb403.txt,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","HELD: The court granted interim relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, and The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The Court ordered that the respondent pay the petitioner the sum of $1,500 per month. The court found that the petitioner had established a prima facie case that the applicant stood in loco parentis to the children and that she was a “spouse” by virtue of the definition in the Act. The issue was whether the applicant had established that the appellant stood in a loco parentalis (i.e. to stand in front of the children) and whether the appellant was a person who had demonstrated a settled intention to treat the children as child of his or her own. HELD: 1) Given the short-term relationship and to add impetus to having the issues resolved sooner rather than later, the court ordered that these payments be paid for a total period of eight months. 2) There was no dispute the petitioner and the appellant cohabited as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that the appellants were a'spouse' by definition. The fact that one is not the biological parent of a child does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide financial support for that child. 3) Given all of these somewhat unusual factors, the Court concluded that Ms. McPhail was in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. The respondent was in a position to pay some monies in the interim, although there was no opposition to her request for interim child support. Given the somewhat unusual circumstances, it is appropriate to grant the relief that she seeks."
4_2010skqb193.txt,"The litigation revolved around a claim by the plaintiffs for damages that resulted from a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006. In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery. HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence. Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery. In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery. The plaintiff was granted 40 days from the date of the order to reply to the demand for particulars.","FIAT: The plaintiffs were operating a tractor unit bearing Manitoba licence plates and pulling semi-trailer bearing an Alberta licence plate. The tractor was owned by an Alberta company and the plaintiffs, presumably husband and wife, were, at all material times, residents of the Province of Alberta. On the 22nd day of August 2004, the plaintiffs were involved in a head on collision on a stretch of highway in Saskatchewan. The plaintiffs sustained a right leg injury, lacerations, back injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. The defendant auto insurers of each of the three provinces are named defendants. Saskatchewan was governed by a no-fault insurance regime. The plaintiff's statement of claim accords with Rule 139 and goes, perhaps as far in particularity as the state of health of the plaintiff, who is still under treatment for her injuries and special damages for same as such are not now fully ascertainable. Both the first and second reasons just stated have merit. The defendants are entitled to this information, at a minimum, before discovery. Rule 164 enables a party, after delivery of the initial pleadings of the opponent, to demand better particulars and disclosure of documents. This Rule contains at least two major purposes: first, to assess the merits of the case in greater detail then mandated by Rule 139. By more fully comprehending the details and nuances, defendant may, with the appropriate disclosure, assess merits of settlement discussions. Second, further particulars may be required in order to properly prepare for examination for discovery. There may be other considerations as well."
5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issue of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The issue of access was to be mutually agreed upon between the respondent and the child. HELD: 1) The respondent is to pay one-half of the cost of extra-curricular activities as set forth on Exhibits P-9, P-10 and P-ll. The petitioner's income is fixed at $11,376.00 per year and the respondent's adjusted income at $25,721.07. 2) The court ordered the addition of a capital cost allowance of $24,000 to the value of the farm equipment. 3) The Court ordered a charge on the petitioner's personal land. 4) There was no evidence as to whether the petitioner had any interest in the standing crop. 5) The appraised gross land value was $176,000. However, the respondent testified that he had large input costs which were not charged as debt to the matrimonial property. The Court agreed that the average capital cost on land and buildings should be added back for purposes of determining the income and for the purpose of the Guidelines. 6) The petitioner was to pay 1/4 of the rent of the van. 7) The amount of the loan secured by the van now in the possession of the petitioner was reduced by $2,200. Therefore, for the purposes of the guidelines, the court ordered $3,000 less the $15,580 to be paid to the petitioner. The judgment shall be a charge of $1,000 on the respondent.' 8) The parties agreed that any access as between the petitioner and the Child shall be agreed upon by the respondent in their respective percentage based on the guidelines. 9) There were no costs awarded to either party and each must pay his or her own costs. 10) The evidence of the respondent was not clear as to what took place over the last three years. The court agreed that $1 million must be added to the values of the land value as the net increase in the equity in the six quarters."
5_2002skqb378.txt,"All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old. The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.","The mother was ordered to pay ongoing child support of $1,500 plus s.7 expenses. Child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father should pay ongoing support for the child of $293 per month. The mother's income for child support purposes was $35,269.44 and she was only three months of age when she and her father were separated. The parties were unable to reach an agreement with respect to child support and accordingly proceeded to trial. The issues before the Court were: 1) Child support including s. 7 expenses; whether the child support order should be made retroactive; costs. 2) Retroactive child support. The father's contribution to [N.G.K.B.]s s. 8(f) expenses should be 59% of the child's 2002 music program expense. The expense relating to the pre-school would qualify as extraordinary given the mother's limited income of $9,517.08 per year ($793.09 per month). The mother was aware of her obligation to provide support for her child and that negotiations had been ongoing for some time as to what level of support she should be assessed at. A $20 expense for kindergarten cannot meet such a qualification."

5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.","HELD: The appeals were dismissed with costs. The court found that the respondent was a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant to s. 222(d) of the Non-profit Corporations Act and that the Chambers judge made errors in his approach to the application of the relevant statutory provisions.  1) The court did not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the broad rules of natural justice. The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by Mr. Mowat and others about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the question before the Court. 2) It is not necessary to work through the merits of these arguments because, regardless of how they might play out, the Court is entirely satisfied that the president of the Students' Union is a proper person to bring this application as per s.222(d). 3) The Chambers judge erred in finding that the students' Union had 'preordained' its own preordained outcome by endorsing the referendum result. 4) The Court concluded that the student's Union did not have standing to bring its application. It was entirely satisfied the President of the Federation and the Students’ Union were a pro-student body and that its members had been a leading voice against joining the Federation. 5) The student’s union was a “proper” person’ who was actively involved in the referendum campaign and was a prominent voice for the students’ union. He was a member of the Student’S Union both at the time of the referendum and at time the actions about which he complained took place took place. 6) It was not necessary for the Court to look at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The student was not entitled to relief under s. 225(d.)."
5_2011nssc53.txt,"A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate. In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister. The parties will bear their own costs. There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded. As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here. The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid. The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation? In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.",HELD: The application was not about the meaning of the mother's will but rather about the failure of the representatives of the Hand's estate to provide an accounting. The father sought party and party costs against his son. The mother clearly made a gift to him that failed. The evidence referred to at para. 23 and 24 of the main decision showed that the possibility of that failure was brought to the attention of the father before she executed the will. The court ordered the parties' costs to be paid out of the estate.

The plaintiff was to apply for the permit, as it was the signage expert. Although approval was never received, the sign was delivered and installed.

The plaintiffs brought a claim in contract and tort alleging Hagblom caused a fire in their building. The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation. The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence. In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. Leave was granted nunc pro tunc to bring third party proceedings. (1)The third party claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action. It was not plain and obvious the claim could not succeed. It was arguable on the pleadings that the third parties did not act in good faith in that it was alleged they deliberately set out to suppress information and destroy evidence.

The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial. Appeal allowed in part; the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given. Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided. However, opinions typically asked of an expert witness with respect to the medical services provided by the respondent that were not formed as part of his diagnosis and treatment of the appellant are not required to be provided. Interrogatories cannot be used to usurp the Rules surrounding the use of expert evidence.","The appellant applied for leave to appeal and, if granted, to appeal the interlocutory order refusing to appoint Dr. Miller a court expert and refusing to order him to answer certain interrogatories, the majority of which call for his opinion concerning the medical services provided by the respondent, another physician, to the appellant. The appellant commenced an action against the respondent alleging negligence in the performance of the circumcision. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed in part per reasons for judgment of Hamilton, J.A., and Cromwell, JJ.A.; the chambers judge considered this issue of opinion and I am satisfied he erred by overstating the basis upon which a non-party witness may object to answering an interrogatory calling for an opinion, when he stated that the appellant cannot be compelled to provide opinion evidence simply because he was a subsequently treating physician even though he may possess an expertise in the area of treatment.  1) The appellant is candid in admitting that he plans to use the answers to Dr Miller's interrogatories as his expert evidence in place of an expert witness and indicates that he is willing to pay for the expert's preparation time. 2) The chambers judge reviewed the issue of opinions and concluded that the respondent was in breach of his own Code of Ethics. He erred in not requiring the respondent to answer all of the interrogatories on the basis that it required an opinion. He did not err in his determination. 3) There is no dispute that only relevant interrogatories need to be answered, perhaps because he does not have the required expertise, did not form any opinions, does not recall any opinions he formed, was not present at the time of the circumcisions and lacks sufficient factual information. 4) The respondent is required to provide all opinions sought, even if this involves reviewing information from other sources, including his opinion on the relevant standard of care, whether it was breached by the appellant and whether the appellant suffered damage as a result of the breach.  5) While recognize medical terminology may be involved, in answering these questions, the appellant should attempt to use language that can be understood by the court, and whether he misapprehended the facts.  6) It would have been better if the appellant had used plainer language in answering some of these interrogatories. The wording in Rule 19.03 did not permit the appellant to use a language that was capable of being understood by a layman."

6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","This is a divorce proceeding between the parties. The parties began cohabitating in 2001 and separated less than one year later. They have a child, Ella, born April 2004.

The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well. The children have been primarily residing with the father. The father has been in three motor vehicle accidents within three years and is facing criminal charges as a result of the most recent one. The father works long hours as a maintenance man. The mother has four other children from previous relationships. The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home. The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education. One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care. While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home. The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort. The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way. HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall. The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father. Joint custody was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines.","The parties met in 2000 when the mother was working in bar. She was married in 2005 and separated in 2009.

The mother claimed that the father had abdicated a significant chunk of his care-giving role to his mother and sisters. HELD: 1) The court found that the respondent was not entitled to the child tax credit and child support paid by the father of the older children were his only sources of income. The court ordered that the children be given regular access to the mother. 2) The respondent is 34 years of age. He was employed full time, earning $1,600 per year. He took on extra weekend work providing security in the home. He had an arrangement with his employer to leave the children in a room at the hotel while he worked. He claimed that he was making significant overtime so that the new general manager of the hotel would not have to deal with the boys. 3) There are few rules. Jake is content to let the boys make choices without supervision or follow-up. His unfortunate injuries in the past two years have made him non-ambulatory and heavily dependent on others. The only other outcome of the pre-trial conference was an agreement to pursue mediation. Mediation never occurred, purportedly because the father was unable to afford it. The Court found that there was no evidence to support the respondent’s claim. The respondent was found to be in breach of his obligations under the Child Tax Credit and Child Tax benefits. The evidence showed that the parties had no intention of pursuing mediation."
6_2014skpc40.txt,"Criminal Law – Recognizance The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.",The accused is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance. The Crown now applies for third recognizances. The Court prays for two recognizanced. HELD: The accused is remanded to November 12. 1) The accused has 59 prior criminal convictions. He has 59 previous convictions. There is a reasonably grounded fear that the accused will commit either a serious personal injury offence or sexual assault. He is at high risk to re-offend both sexually and violently. 2) There is an objective component to his belief that the defendant will commit a serious sexual offence. The evidence from the Correctional Services of Canada and Parole Board Canada documentation and Ms. Woytiuk's testimony that he did not attend AA because it is not offered in the Saskatchewan Penitentiary when it is offered is of suspect probative value. 3) His most recent breaches are minor in nature and should not be taken too seriously in deciding whether further restrictions need to be placed upon him. The court found that there was no prior misconduct in assessing a threat imposed by the Crown. The accused was at risk of committing another serious offence. 4) There are common underlying principles applicable to both of these issues. The first is that a reasonable person armed with the same knowledge as the accused would agree that his fears are reasonable in the circumstances. The second is that there is a subjective and objective component that must be established by the Court. It is not enough to say that he has a reasonable belief that he will commit any serious offence or that his current circumstances are reasonable. 5) The Court found that the Court was unable and refused to make generality of that sort of analysis.
6_2015skqb138.txt,"Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","FIAT: The applicant seeks an order directing a trial to prove the 2013 will in solemn form. HELD: The application is dismissed. The court found that the applicant has not made an issue for trial. 1) There is a genuine issue to be tried with respect to the grounds on which the challenge is based, such as lack of testamentary capacity or the presence of undue influence. 2) The Court found that it is necessary only to satisfy the court that there is 'a genuine issue' with respect the grounds of the challenge. The application must be dismissed.  3) The court reviewed the specific evidence contained in the several affidavits filed in respect of the application. 4) There was no evidence of irregularity or evidence on the peripheral points which will lead the Chambers judge to conclude that the evidence itself is not in dispute and that the propounder of the will reassumes the legal burden of establishing testamentaries."
7_1990canlii4117.txt,"Where the petitioner demonstrated that she did not upgrade her education during the marriage as a result of her attempts to become pregnant and thus there was a causal connection between the petitioner's need and the marriage, interim maintenance in the amount of $100 per month was ordered ,  having regard to the means, needs and circumstances of each spouse.","The parties were married fifteen years. During the marriage, the wife spent a lot of time under medical care in an effort to become pregnant. At the time of separation, she suffered a miscarriage. She sought periodic maintenance to allow her to upgrade her education so that she would become financially independent. The parties were divorced in 1989. The wife had been employed as a clerk for fifteen years and had concerns during the marriage that she was underpaid. She spent a considerable time under the medical care and was unsuccessful in getting pregnant. She was seeking periodic maintenance. HELD: The application for interim maintenance was dismissed. 1)To move matters along towards the goal of financial independence and considering the means, and needs, and circumstances of each spouse, acknowledging that this may not be the basis for a lump sum or monthly periodic maintenance being made at the time the divorce is heard, I find there is some causal relationship between the wife's attempts to obtain a new car and the fact that she did not upgrade her Education. 2)The Court awarded the requested amount of $500 per month interim maintenance. The Court awarded $100 per month. 3)It was inappropriate to award $500.00 per month until this matter was resolved."

The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order that determined after trial that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the respondent's pension plan during negotiations during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with brief written reasons to follow. 1)The court found the parties could not reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or instalment basis must be clear. 2)There was nothing in the evidence to indicate the parties intended that each individual item agreed to during the course of negotiations toward final agreement would constitute separate, independent and binding agreement irrespective of whether agreement was reached on all of the other items outstanding between the parties. Accordingly, there was no contract that the judge could enforce. 3)The Court found that the court was not hesitant in upsetting or rectifying minutes of settlement unless of course there be something in the nature of fraud, incapacity of party, or the minutes were too vague to enforce or were obviously incomplete."

He alleged the trial judge erred in finding the appellant had reasonable and probable grounds for a breathalyzer demand, and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter was infringed. Dismissing the appeal, that although the stop was an arbitrary detention and the exclusion of evidence of a breath test, the Court held that the Court was not satisfied that s. 8(9) and s. 9 of the Canadian Charter had been breached.

The trial was to be held before a jury.HELD: 1)The Court has a general discretion as to severance of issues which must be exercised judicially. 2)Severance should only be ordered when the judge has a serious reason to believe that the trial of the issue proposed to be severed will put an end to the action. 3)The Court accepted the Plaintiff's submission that expert medical evidence would be necessary to establish the cause of the accident since the Plaintiff had suffered brain damage and would be unable to testify. This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found. 4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages. A jury cannot be disassembled and then recalled to conclude the trial of the remaining issues. 5)The Court was of the view that there should be compelling reasons before issues should be severed for trial, but that no compelling reason had been established in this case.","This was an application by the defendants for an order pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction severing the issues of liability and damages. Dismissing the application would result in the plaintiffs being disentitled from their right to have a jury decide what is the appropriate quantum of damages. HELD: 1)An application for severance of the issues should only be granted for the most compelling reasons and in cases in which it is probable that the trial of one issue will put an end to the action. 2)The Court held that no jury, whether discharged or not, can be reassembled some time later to carry on with the second part of the trial. This would require, an examination of the injuries and how they are sustained. Such an examination would be necessary to establish the origin of the accident and would necessitate the plaintiffs to establish their causation. 3)The issue of liability in favour of the defendants will not be prejudiced by prior determination of the issue of damages unnecessary. 4)No jury can be reconstituted."
7_1996canlii7107.txt,"The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600. The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amount of on-going maintenance of $600 per month for his 2 daughters. An order suspending enforcement of arrears during periods when the respondent is unemployed was granted.

The father was to pay $200 per month on arrear in addition to the on-go child support obligation. 2)The court ordered the father to pay support for $350 per month in the months of 1995 and 1996. 3)The Court ordered that the child support be reduced by $7,000 and that if the respondent earns more than $1,200 he was topay $200.00 per month to reduce his monthly child support obligations. 4)Given the significant reduction in income experienced by the respondent since 1994, there has been a material change in circumstances.

The mother was entitled to make a claim for support whenever she believed his contribution was inadequate, whether or not she perceived herself separated from him. 2)The primary purpose of a support order is not to compensate for past failure but to satisfy present need.

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action. The conclusion of the investigation conducted by the RCMP as a result of the superintendent's investigation order was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution.","The bankrupt was in bankruptcy for 28 months. He alleged that the failure of his former business Red Bull Enterprises Ltd. caused him to look at bankruptcy as the only alternative. He sought an order of disbursement under s.173(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act, alleging that the provisions of s.295(5)(a of the Act) would allow disclosure of his business expenses. The bankrupt submitted that he was not obliged to file an affidavit but felt that it was their own fault he stopped making payments because they didn't do what he wanted them to do. He also alleged that he had been pressured by his common law spouse into putting his business on the line. HELD: 1)There was an investigation conducted by the R.C.M.P. as a result of the superintendent's investigation order.  2)The evidence would not support a successful prosecution.  3)The principle and exemption contained in the s.294(5) of The Excise Tax Act would allow the disclosure of goods and services tax remittances of Clearsky. Since the bankrupt was a director of the bankrupt's company, he argued that disclosure would be unnecessary. 4)The respondent's application for a discharge was opposed by certain creditors. 5)The plaintiff's affidavit evidence was based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge.  6)The bankrupt's evidence was not convincing.  7)It was not proven that the principles and exemptions contained in s.285(5(a) and s295(6a) were proven.  8)The only conclusion was that the evidence would be insufficient to justify the application.  9)The court cannot accept that s.243(4)(a), s.241(4)of the Act is a final matter and Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules requires that affidavit evidence must be based upon evidence of personal knowledge and 10)The failure of a business to meet its financial obligations was not the only reason to file for bankruptcy."

7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the credit union held a security interest. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The evidence falls well short of proving that the plaintiff could have derived any rent from the property, had the building not been there, beyond the amount that was actually recovered. The reasonable rental value can be estimated, albeit with limitations, by reference to the amount of improvement taxes the plaintiff had to pay to keep the town from taking the property for taxes. 2)The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages for unjust enrichment in the same amount as the damages determined in connection with the tenancy at sufferance issue. 3)In order to resolve this appeal it is necessary to consider whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intention to do so. It would have been improper for Gari to deny permission to remove the Building unless the credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. That stance would be inconsistent with the regime established pursuant to the Public Property Safety Act. 4)Gari's claims in this regard must fail."

7_2010nssc146.txt,"The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence. Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.","The accused brought an application for relief under s.24(1) of the Charter alleging that the Crown's intention to lead newly discovered evidence compromises her s. and 11(d) Charter rights.

The accused had taken a position that she had no knowledge of the contents of the prisoner package seized following the search of Thomas Izzard and of the other evidence of drugs seized from her home pursuant to a search warrant executed soon thereafter. 3)The Court was satisfied that the accused had succeeded in proving a breach of her right to make full answer and a defence of re-election.

The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","The issues include parenting, child support and spousal support. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit of October 16, 2012, including Exhibit A. The parties agree that the meeting is without prejudice. The petitioner did not oppose the respondent remaining in the home on a time limited basis and suggested it should terminate June 27, 2013. HELD: 1) The respondent was granted interim exclusive possession of the family home.  2) The whole of the settlement process is protected, that is, all communications in furtherance of settlement from the first utterance or letter to the last. While it may be that parties in a settlement meeting reach a consensus on a number of issues, the privilege continues to extend to those issues where there may have been a consensus unless there is a clear understanding and agreement that once one of the issues is resolved it is off the table and considered to be settled irrespective of what may happen with respect to other issues that may exist as between the parties. 3) The petitioner cohabitated with a woman who was employed full-time but assumed for present purposes that she was not at this time a common law partner for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. (2nd Supp.) and the petitioner secured employment as an educational assistant. She anticipates an income of $19,211 with union dues of $102. She has estimated her one-half share of basic monthly expenses at $2,000 per month. 4) The parties have three children. They now have shared parenting arrangement and it assumes the petitioner is paying mortgage payments for three children as $1,547 per month and the respondent's van payment of $87.6 per month; utilities of $419 per month, the van payment $87 and life insurance premiums $102; and a basement suite in the family house which the petitioner could rent out for $700 per month for 187 school days per year. It is premature at this point to make any determination as to whether the respondent remains under employed and whether the communication must be made with the express or implied intention that it would not be disclosed to the court in the event negotiations failed. 5) The court struck the last three sentences of para. 4 and Exhibit A from the petitioner’s affidavit of September 2012. The court found that the parties had reached agreement on seven issues, but that the respondent did not reach agreement on all of them.  6) The Court concluded that the privilege is clearly an important one and"
8_1990canlii4256.txt,"Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility. Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.","The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. The child testified that she had been sexually assaulted on numerous occasions. She also testified that her stepfather had touched her breasts and inside her pants. The trial judge found that the complainant's evidence had been consistent throughout and had been given in a reasonable manner 'worthy of belief'. He also found that over the time period covered by the information he was left 'in little doubt' that opportunities could and did present themselves for the appellant to have had a relationship with the complainant.' The question then was whether the admission of the hearsay evidence of the appellant was an error so grave as to call for a quashing of the conviction. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The evidence of an expert was admissible. It provides assistance to the trial judge in concluding whether an assault has occurred. 2)The Court of Appeal must not merely substitute its view for that of the jury, in order to apply the test the court must re-examine and, to some extent, reweigh and consider the effect of the evidence."
8_1997canlii10895.txt,"The only issue was the amount of monthly maintenance to be paid by the respondent for the one child. The average income of the respondent over the past three years was approximately $180,000. The applicant claimed her 1996 income of $128,000 was extra-ordinary as payment was received for projects completed in the previous two years. The applicant claimed special monthly expenses of $1,200 to cover nanny and child care costs, $125 for medication, $25 for recreation and $200 for a university fund. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay $1,794 per month. Section 4 of the guidelines was applicable. The significant income of the applicant is a factor to be taken into consideration. 2)The applicant did not establish that the claims for recreation and the university fund were expenses that were 'special' or 'extra-ordinary'. 3)The respondent was responsible for 2/3 of the nanny and child care costs which were justified pursuant to s7(1)(c) of the guidelines.","The only issue to be determined in this application was the amount of monthly maintenance to be paid by the respondent as support for their child who was born on September 30, 1986. Both parties are medical practitioners and each enjoys significant income. The applicant earned approximately $180,000. HELD: 1)The respondent was to be responsible for approximately 2/3 of the monthly maintenance. 2)The significant income enjoyed by the applicant is a factor to be taken into consideration when determining the proportion of extra-extra-ordinary expenses. The less income tax benefit available to the petitioner 3,000% was also appropriate. 3)The claim for nanny and child care costs was reviewed pursuant to s.7(1)(a) of the guidelines and the claim for a university fund for the child was justified under s7(c) of s7."
8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The respondents were separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan on December 1, 1993. The Crown argued that the respondents were in fact fishing for food and an aboriginal right to fish for food. The trial judge did not make a finding that the defendants were fishing for commercial purposes, but instead failed to distinguish between an Aboriginal right and an 'Aboriginal right' as protected under s. 26(a) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations. The respondents were Metis and resided at reasonably isolated Metis community named Turnor Lake. At trial, counsel acting for the respondents advanced standard criminal law defences to the charges, and also a constitutional defence that they as Metis had an aboriginal rights to fish which the Saskatchewan fishery regulations infringed. The accused was found not guilty on counts 1, 2, 6, 7 and 8 based on the standard defence of aboriginal rights. The defence argued that commercial fishing was not an issue in this case because the Crown did not intend to make an allegation of commercial fishing. HELD: The Court found that the Crown had not erred in law by failing to establish that the accused were fishing commercially. The Court ordered that the Court revise its Brief in light of the issue which was argued at trial."
8_1998canlii13830.txt,"An appeal of conviction on a charge of dangerous driving on the grounds the trial judge erred in holding that statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in the criminal proceedings; and in holding the statements could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police and therefore were voluntary and admissible. The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement. Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal. Objections to the admissiblilty of the accused's statements based upon the Charter raise a different issue and considerations from the application of common law principles and a different conclusion may have been reached.","The appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction set aside. 1)Had the Charter issues been raised and argued before the learned trial judge, a conclusion different from the one reached (based solely upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness) may well have resulted. 2)The Court of Appeal in Pelletier case directed a new trial in the Provincial Court."
8_1999canlii12948.txt,"FIAT. The applicant sought a declaration that the plaintiffs' solicitors had breached confidentiality and were in a conflict of interest and asked that they be removed as solicitors of record in this action. The applicant's husband had given her personal letters, records and documents to his solicitor in 1995. These documents were relevant to a defamation action brought by her children or their spouses. The applicant argued that a fiduciary relationship was created when the documents were accepted which was close enough to a solicitor-client retainer to give rise to a need for confidentiality and that the public's confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined if any member of that law firm acted for the plaintiffs. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs. No solicitor-client relationship was created between the husband's lawyer and the applicant when the documents were received. There was no breach of confidentiality or conflict of interest as contemplated by Chapters IV and V of the Code of Professional Conduct. No fiduciary duty was owed to the applicant when the solicitor accepted the documents from the applicant's husband. The husband was not acting as agent for his wife nor was it accepted that he delivered the documents for safe keeping. The husband's solicitor had forwarded the documents to the applicant's lawyer. The fact that the husband now supported his wife in the defence of her action did not change the situation that existed in 1995.","FIAT. The applicant seeks an order declaring that the solicitors for the plaintiffs have breached confidentiality and are in conflict of interest between clients. She asks that they be removed as solicitors of record. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs. 1)No solicitor-client relationship was created between Lois Hudson and the law firm of Politeski Strilchuk Milen when, what proved to be confidential documents, were received by her from Neil Hudson. The same information as contained in the documents, although perhaps in some other form, was available to the plaintiff from other sources. 2)No fiduciary duty was owed to Lois Hudson resulting from the acceptance by Ms. Polischuk of documents from the defendant. No other duty existed relating to her law firm which she is a member of. 3)No other duty or duty existed between the applicant and Lois Hudson. No matter how high the legal standards were, there was no obligation on Lois to deliver the documents to anyone other than her. The fact that Neil Hudson now supports his wife in her defence of the action brought by the plaintiffs does not change the situation that existed in 1995. To extend the confidentiality of solicitor client relationships to the circumstances of this case would, in my view, lead to unreasonable results. 4)Since no solicitor client relationship and no other duty was a owed by Lois Hudson to Lois, none existed relating with the firm of the Law Firm of the same name, the application was dismissed. 5)Since Lois Hudson did not give any instructions and as the documents were not required in the proceedings then underway, they were forwarded to the lawyer for Lois Hudson, who was not required to take any action or refrain from doing anything. It cannot be said that any breach of confidentiality occurred or that any of the above was a result of Lois Hudson delivering the documents."
8_2000skqb570.txt,"The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender of four made in response to the defendant's invitation to tender on a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The tender package contained the usual privilege clause which stated the lowest tender need not be accepted. It is an implied term of the contract that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenders fairly and will not give any an unfair advantage.  2)The plaintiff had no experience in the type of pesticide spraying. It was not known at the time that the plaintiff made arrangements to hire an experienced subcontractor. The consultant hired to advise the defendant on the technical aspects of the project used reliable independent sources for his information about the operational viability of the planes. He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.  3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment.","The Government of Saskatchewan tendered a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. Four companies submitted tenders in response to the defendant's invitation to tender. The plaintiff, West Central Air Ltd., submitted the lowest tender and the contract was awarded to another tenderer, Nielsen Ashdown who had previous experience in the area and whose planes received favourable reports. HELD: The plaintiff was treated fairly by the defendant and no unfair advantage was given to the plaintiff in selecting the successful tenderer on the project. The implied term of fairness and the privilege clause are compatible and can co-exist. While costs usually follow the result, this is an appropriate case in which to exercise my discretion to disallow costs to the successful party. 1) The person inviting the tenders must treat all tenderers fairly and be treated fairly and equally. The privilege clause entitles him to consider all relevant factors, such as the amount of each tender, the experience and capabilities of the tenderers and the equipment to be used, in determining who should get the contract. In every case, Curniski conducted his investigation in a fair and impartial manner and in accordance with common industry practice. He used reliable independent sources for his information. 2) It is impossible to say that the plaintiff compensated for its lack of experience by making arrangements to bring on board an experienced sub-contractor—a fact Stanley did not know at the time he made his recommendation. 3) With the benefit of hindsight, it now appears that it is now apparent the plaintiff had compensated for it lack of experienced by making arrangement to bring someone on board who was not aware of the fact it was the lowest tenderer."

The Credit Union as first mortgagee opposed the application. The co-owner did not participate.

The wife prevented every attempt to show the property to prospective owners. There was no reason to assume she will be any more cooperative with a court appointed realtor. The Credit Union did not request immediate possession. 2)The court's entitlement to order a judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. The court reviewed the history of the statutory authority for a judicial sale in a mortgage foreclosure proceedings. The 1852 Chancery Procedure Amendment Act was repealed in 1881 and replaced by Ordinance 51, Rule 1, which became law in the NWT by virtue of the Judicature Ordinance No.6 of 1893.

8_2006skqb274.txt,"DIGEST The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000. HELD: 1) The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents. The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public. The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry. This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.  2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000. The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'. Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit. 3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.","The appellants were convicted by a provincial court judge of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act, [HELD: 1] and [1]Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The fines were too harsh and the consecutive sentences exceeded the overall capability of the offender to pay. HELD: The total sentence imposed by the provincial court was a fine of $69,000 allocated amongst the fifteen counts. The total fine was $72,000. The Court of Appeal decision of R. v. Roussy, [1977] O.J. No. 1208, [summarized W.C.B. 72] referred to deterrence in its widest sense. The sentence imposed was insufficient to deter the offender from committing these offences and was an error in principle. The maximum fines prescribed by the Act are $750,000 and the total fine is $68,000 for placing elk in danger and two offences respectively. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit' in that it exceeded his overall capability to pay and the sentences exceeded his own."
8_2007skpc1.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached.

There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy was a stay of proceedings. HELD: The Court found the accused suffered actual prejudice because the outstanding charge has affected her ability to apply for higher-paying job opportunities, and has caused her stress and frustration. The passage of time makes it more difficult to properly defend against the charges. The accused did not contribute to the remaining delay. There were some delays attributable to the accused in time until she was ready to enter pleas, and later until her ready to have the matter rescheduled for trial, delays which were deducted from the time she appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charges set for trial."

Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue. Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms.","The parties were married in 1993 and had two children, aged 12 and 7.

In 2006, the parties agreed that child support would be based on the difference between what the husband would have paid to the wife for the support of the two children and what the wife would have been required to pay if the shared custody arrangement did not exist. The applicant now seeks to vary the child support terms of that order. HELD: The previous variation order was a consent order. Under those circumstances the Court was not prepared to retroactively vary the terms of this order or the last variation order effective on a date prior to the date of the last order. 1) The applicant's income for child support purposes was $18,593. It was a recurring income figure over the past four years, including 2008. It is not an adjustment contemplated by Schedule III. 2) There have been changes in circumstances since the time of the original order. Changes in the income of the parties, particularly in 2007, have affected the applicant's ability to pay child support based on a level of income significant portion of which he does not actually have at his disposal. There were changes of circumstances which would prevent the Court from retroactively varying the order."
8_2011skca35.txt,"The applicants applied for leave to appeal from a Chambers decision denying their application to dismiss the respondent's claim against them for want of prosecution. The applicants were partners in an architecture firm that provided design drawing and specifications for the construction of the Education Building at the University of Saskatchewan. The building was substantially completed in 1970. In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building. In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss. In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief. In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer. The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997. Between 1997 and 2010, documents were exchanged, discoveries were held and an unsuccessful settlement negotiation was held. In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution. The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant. Secondly, the issue of delays in litigation is important and the case will present an opportunity for the Court to clarify the legal framework pertaining to such matters.","The applicants are defendants in an action commenced by the Respondent, University of Saskatchewan. They applied to have the University's claim against them dismissed for want of prosecution but were unsuccessful. They now seek leave to appeal that decision. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted. 1) The Court found that the Court's decision to strike the claim against the applicants was of no general importance and that there was enough merit in their position to warrant granting leave. 2) The standard of review applied in respect of decisions such as the one in issue here will present some difficulty for the Applicants on appeal. Nonetheless, the Court is persuaded there is enough merit to warrant granted leave."

He had alleged in that regard, a breach of his rights to counsel of choice under s. 10(b) and s. s. 24 of the Charter. HELD: The accused was released from custody on a voir dire basis. The evidence was applied to the trial proper. The accused abandoned his Charter application under ss. and thereof. The Court reviewed the evidence and concluded that the accused had not waived his right to counsel. The court concluded that there was a waiver of the accused’s right to a reasonable opportunity to choose counsel. As well, the evidence was excluded from the trial."
8_2013skqb397.txt,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction. The applicants were trying to use habeas corpus when they actually were seeking a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies were available only through the Federal Court.","The applicants brought an application for writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, seeking unconditional release from the Riverbend Minimum Institution due to a threat to their respective liberties claiming that the Correctional Service of Canada has violated their rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in not allowing them to reside in a common housing unit so that they can participate in their long-standing, same-sex relationship outside of the public domain. HELD: The application was granted. Although the applicants had framed their application under the pretence of habas corpus, the true character of the remedies being sought by them is a writ of certioraris, prohibition or mandamus and these remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process. These remedies fall outside the confines of their jurisdiction. Habeas corpus is a guarantee of liberty, not a channel for drawing our Court into the day-to-day management of prison.  1) The applicants are seeking to challenge administrative decisions of the correctional service of Canada which do not impact their residual liberty. While the applicants have framed themselves as a party with a disability, their application to the court falls within exclusive territory of the federal court of Canada, through which they must decline their jurisdiction to grant a remedy on the application guised as a habea corpus application. Hearsay for the applicants; it is not for this Court to determine the reasonableness of the administrative decisions made by the Correctional Services of Canada within its confines. The Court assumes that neither of the applicants' situations have changed for the purpose of rendering this decision. 2) The Court has concluded that it must decline its jurisdiction, pursuant to policies of the agency and as contained in the R.R.A. Handbook, to grant remedies against federal institutions and decision-makers is narrow. It is not necessary that this Court is for this court to determine, determine and adjudicate the reasons for the decision of the Corrections of Canada declining a housing reassignment request or the policy that all inmates found in a housing unit other than their own will be subject to disciplinary charges. The court assumes that both of the applicant's situations have not changed. 3) The application to be allowed to make submissions to the Court on Sinobert's behalf and his own behalf proved beneficial for everyone as towards the end of the argument he had to be assisted for blood sugar related situation that had culminated during the application."
9_1996canlii6809.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff brought an action against five defendants claiming fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a skin rash were the result of silicone implants. One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning Canada Inc. (Dow Corning). Ten years later she received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. She suffered from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a persistent immune mediated skin rash on her chest. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The statement of claim does not disclose wrongful conduct on the part of the defendant, the Dow Chemical Company, in both tort and contract and it is appropriate for this Court to assume jurisdiction in respect to the claim as it relates to that particular defendant. If fault is found to be directly attributable to the defendant the court will assume jurisdiction. 2)There are allegations which must assume a factual basis. There is a causal connection between the alleged failure to disclose and the plaintiff's injuries. 3)There is an allegation that the corporate entity, DowCorning Corporation, was created for a specific task by the defendant and that in the carrying-out of that task they were in reality one and the same entity.  4)In respect to both situations there are allegations of allegations which I must assume have a factual foundation. That being said, the statement of claims does disclose wrongful behaviour on the defendant's part and there is a link between that conduct and the alleged damages suffered by the plaintiff."
9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","The deceased's widow received a death benefit for herself and two children. She took issue with the calculation of the death benefit, which was based on the percentage of her late husband's net income rather than on his gross income. SGI applied for a review of the decision as provided by the Act. HELD: The deceased's counsel appealed the decision to the Court of Queen's Bench. 1)Section 146(1) is a self-contained formula. The death benefit is 50% if the victim's gross yearly employment income and is calculated on a yearly basis. The ordinary meaning of this is that the payment is made to the surviving spouse on a weekly basis. 2)The 'weekly income replacement benefit' referred to in Division 5 of the Act is one-half the 'income replacement benefit'. 3)The actual income earned, without any limiting maximum, is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The interpretation suggested by SGI is appropriate when calculating the benefit for dependent children."
9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.",The accused was 19 years old at the time of the accident and lived in the city. He was charged with dangerous driving causing death. The Crown argued that a sentence in the lower end of the range is one which should be imposed and that such a sentence should be a conditional sentence to be served in the community rather than in a corrections facility. HELD: The accused was sentenced to 90 days in the Provincial Correctional Centre. 1)The Court noted that the accused had consumed significant quantity of alcohol and was in no shape to drive vehicle. His actions were clearly inappropriate and imprudent and his failure to drive in normal fashion resulted in the death of his passenger. 2)The accused had not been paying attention to the traffic lights. His driving was erratic and dangerous. He had been involved in a night of drinking and partying without sleep. The accused had driven in a manner that would have resulted in a significant change in his driving habits. 3)The court noted that there was a troubling factor in this instance. Subsequent convictions of the accused for two speeding offences resulted in him being sentenced to three years less day. 4)The sentence was reduced to a sentence of imprisonment for 90 days.
9_1999canlii12597.txt,"The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action. The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act (the “Act”) which: 1) restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the petitioner or his solicitors in relation to the respondent’s claim against the Attorney general of Canada; and 2)restrains MLT from disposing of any of the monies that he has received or may receive in relation thereto. The respondent argued that if the entire proceeds from the Action were disposed of, the petitioner would imprudently or improperly dispose of such funds or otherwise fail to use them to support his family. HELD: The respondent was granted an interim order set aside. 1)The sum of $40,000.00 will likely be sufficient security for the claim under the Act. 2)The court was not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent or equitable jurisdiction applied to an application under the act.  3)The respondent had only one asset that he had at this time that might give him an ability to satisfy the Act that was made by the petitioner on behalf of herself and the children, Joel Raphael, born August 1990 and Tosha Anderson, born February 1992.  4)The Court was also unable to determine whether the disposition or wasting of the specified asset would impair or defeat the claim."
9_2003skqb229.txt,"An appeal of conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (Criminal Code s.255 and s.253) on the grounds of misdirection in finding there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to impairment; an incorrect inference and failure to give correct legal effect to the facts as found including the lack of evidence of impairment at the material time while he was in care or control of the vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence. Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence. The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.  2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838). However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba). A properly instructed jury could have arrived at the same inference on the facts as found.","The accused was convicted of driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs contrary to s. 255 and 253 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge misdirected herself in finding that the trial judge found sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was impaired during time frame No. 1. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge made no palpable or overriding error in her assessment of the evidence, her interpretation of the law or her application of the applicable law to the evidence. 2)The Court was satisfied that the judge's findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment by alcohol were supported by the evidence and that the accused's condition did not change for the period that he was in the driver's seat and if impairment is proven, which is the next issue will deal with, then it applies equally to when he was first observed in the vehicle as to later observed in it. 3)The court found that the Court's inference was one that a properly instructed jury could have arrived at on the facts in the instant case and therefore should not be interfered with."
9_2008skqb301.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT: The parties to this action have reached an impasse on the required disclosure and seek various orders. The defendants seek injunctions against the defendants, return of property taken by the defendants and damages for breach of contract and disgorgement of all profits gained through the breaches of fiduciary obligations. HELD: 1) The defendants are granted their application to have the plaintiffs' claim severed so that the threshold issue of liability shall be tried prior to requiring the defendants to disclose and be discovered on the issue of damages.  2) The court has considered the effect of disclosure on promoting settlement between the parties. The issues in this litigation are such that delay in full disclosure of material pertaining to damages makes little difference. Both parties know the profitability of the SR&ED consulting business. The risks that must be weighed in considering settlement pertain to liability. 3) There is no order as to costs. 4) The Court granted the defendants' application to strike portions of the claim. 5) The application to sever the plaintiffs’ claim was dismissed.  6) There was no order for injunctions. 7) The plaintiffs had no assurance that the defendants were not pursuing their clients. Much of the defendants’ client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the plaintiffs obligation to maintain this confidence. The plaintiffs could be liable to the accounting firm should it breach that confidentiality."

The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received. There will be no costs awarded for this unsuccessful application.","FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. The defendants entered into a mortgage with the plaintiff on April 14, 2005 for land described as: Lot 4, Block 17, Plan No. 85SC07177, Extension 0, Burstall, SK. The mortgage was renewed for a year period with a maturity date of March 14, 2008. This was not in compliance with s. 3(2) of the Act which prescribes that an application may be brought after the expiration of 30 clear days from the date of service on the Provincial Mediation Board. HELD: The application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for six months and on the basis that there is no sale to be confirmed based on the evidence filed. On renewed application for confirm of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the court any offers received. On a renewed application to confirm judicial sale the application for a review is premature. The applicant's position is that this is overvalued and would likely sell in the $30,000 to $45,000 range based on a real estate company's knowledge of property being sold in the area. On an application for the appointment for a hearing for the application by the proposed plaintiff for leave to commence action, the applicant will offer to purchase the mortgaged property for the sum of $35,000. The statement of claim was not noted for default prior to the application being made. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer but does not appear to have done so. There is limited evidence with respect to the value of the land and no evidence from the licensed realtor who was charged with the responsibility of listing the property as to the steps. The affidavit of Randy Schneider, the manager of the Mendham-Burstall Credit Union, was filed in support of the application. Counsel invites the court to apply Rule 5(1) of Rule 5 of the Queen’s Bench Rules of Court. The only evidence of the value at this stage is contained in paragraph 10 of the above noted affidavit, sworn on June 10, 2008 in part as follows: That the land is in my opinion of the valued of $20,000 and would be valued at $45000.

The admissibility of the accused's videotaped statement was at issue with regard to his capacity to understand the Charter caution given by the police. When asked if he wished to contact a lawyer, the accused had responded in the negative, noting that there would 'probably be one down around there anyway.' statement excluded from evidence; the accused's s. 10(b) rights had been violated. It was clear that the accused was confused and not focused on the present and that his mind had wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial as opposed to his immediate right to have counsel. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty that the officer should have made an effort to clarify the informational component of the right to counsel.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault, use or threatened use of weapon, unlawful possession of weapon and failure to comply with his recognizance of August 2, 2008, related to alcohol and weapon possession. The accused was given his Charter rights. He was advised of his right to contact counsel without delay and right to duty counsel. The police were called to the address at approximately 4:30 pm and found the accused lying on the pew and assaulted him with a piece of iron rebar sending him to the hospital with a head injury. The Crown sought admission of the accused's inculpatory statements to the police. HELD: The accused's mind wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial. The Court did not believe he was focussed on the present and his immediate right to have counsel then and there before he made any statement. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty to make it impossible for the police to make a clarification such as, ""Brian, you have the right to counsel now before you make any statement to us."" The Court found that the accused had a fundamental misunderstanding of his basic constitutional rights under s.10(b) of the Charter. He did not understand that he had a choice to make. He chose not to avail himself of immediate counsel and made an informed decision to seek counsel of John Black when he went to court. The court accepted that there was a low threshold with respect to the degree of drunkenness, voluntariness and see no evidence of oppression, threats or promises. The statement was made voluntarily and the accused did not fall victim to the temptation of alcohol or drugs."
9_2011skpc15.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused was charged with mischief under $5,000 and aggravated assault. The major issue for determination was whether the accused can be convicted of both charges. HELD: The accused was convicted of mischief. 1)The mens rea required for s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code, is objective foresight of bodily harm. It is not necessary that there be an intent to wound or maim or disfigure. The section pertains to an assault that has the consequences of wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim. 2)The evidence fell short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 3)The Crown had not proved the requisite intent to sustain convictions under s. 267 of the Code."
9_2014skqb386.txt,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction pursuant to S. 813 of the Code. HELD: The appeal was granted and a new trial ordered. 1) The facts are unremarkable. It's tortured progress through the Canadian criminal justice system makes it much more remarkable than the facts.

The main issue was whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated. The couple's marriage had lasted less than four years. HELD: The QB judgment was upheld regarding the severance package. The severance package was not a reward for past service; it was for payment in lieu of reasonable notice of termination. The severance package was based on future earnings, which would have occurred within the duration of the marriage. The QB judge did however fail to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give the husband his one-half share of them. Judgment varied accordingly.","This was an appeal from a judgment under The Matrimonial Property Act, s.6.1. The main issue was whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated. HELD: The appeal was allowed to the extent referred to above. 1)The judge either overlooked or failed to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give credit to the husband for his one-half share of them. 2)The court overlooked the wife's purchase of a large amount of furniture. 3)The appellant failed to consider that the items in question were valued at the amounts stated in an appraisal, exhibit P-4 and the appropriate credit given to the wife according to which items each of the parties, in the end, received and the judgment shall be varied accordingly. In the event that the parties fail to agree on the amount of the adjustment, the matter shall be referred to the trial judge for determination. The last ground of appeal concerned failure to allow for depreciation in the valuation of an automobile. Since the judge used the only value put in evidence, he can hardly be faulted for assigning that value to <Conclusion> the car."

At trial, the Plaintiff had been awarded damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendant limited her appeal to the amount awarded for future loss of earnings. The Respondent/Plaintiff cross-appealed on the issue of whether the trial judge should have directed the jury to deduct sick leave benefits from her past loss of income. Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","Following a jury trial of this action for damages for personal injuries and loss sustained in an automobile collision, a judgment was pronounced awarding damages of $409,251.18 to the respondent.

HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge admitted the evidence of Douglas Kalesnikoff as expert opinion evidence which resulted in a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. 2)The award for loss of income capacity was so inordinately high that it was perverse, wholly out of all proportion, unsupported by the evidence and unreasonable. 3)The appellant's application to deduct sick leave benefits which were used in consequence of her injuries from the past loss of earnings was highly optimistic given her post injury work record and the opinion of Margaret Friesen that in many ways she is presently working beyond her physical capabilities. However, the trial judge failed to caution the jury regarding the weight to be given to the weight of the evidence. 4)The Court rejected the appellant's contention that the admission of the tabulation and explanation of it resulted in any loss of future income capacity."

For the defendant, that the dismissal was justified. The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules.",The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as a driver and driver's helper.

The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial. The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province. He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. The trial judge further commented that, had the Act been constitutional, he would have convicted because he did not accept the accused's defence of due diligence. The Crown appealed, and the accused cross-appealed. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial, that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction.

b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that reserve on the matter of costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now shows that substantial offers were made through counsel for the parties although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The applicant argues that the position taken before Wimmer J. (who directed the issue to trial) was that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance for Jade based on the needs-based approach and that the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. HELD: The application for a fixed award of costs is dismissed. 1) The Court is faced with two equally untenable positions in determining the costs. If the costs of the litigation were to be paid out of the award, the remainder may be insufficient to meet Jade's anticipated needs. This argument cannot be accepted. 2) The court has an inherent power to vary its own order so as to carry out what was intended or even to reconsider or withdraw the decision so long as the order has not been perfected. Rule 184C of The Queen's Bench Rules allows the court to take into account offers of settlement that do not meet the requirements of the other rules in Part 14A of The Rules in assessing appropriate costs. Rule 343A contemplates amendment of a judgment in these circumstances. There is a substantial monetary difference between the party and party costs awarded in the judgment, and the number of interim applications are partially attributable to the applicant who continued to make exaggerated claim for the whole of the testator's estate well past the time when it was appropriate. This contributed to the respondent's unwillingness to disclose the financial worth of the estate and prolonged the litigation and as such should be factor into the costs awarded."
b_2000skqb106.txt,"SGI paid $47,427, the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, to the guardian of the three infant children of the deceased single mother. The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident. Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854. The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs. Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5). It is the total amount payable as a death benefit. The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero. Where no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s.146(3), no further amount is payable under either s.146(5) or s.147(5).","The deceased single mother, who was unemployed and had no income, appealed the decision of Saskatchewan Government Insurance that the children were not entitled to any additional dependant child care benefits.

Nor would she have become entitled to an income within six months if she had survived the motor vehicle accident. 3)As there was no surviving spouse the children are entitled to the death benefit calculated in accordance with the formula DB (50% IRB) where DB is the deceased victim's death benefit payable; IRB is the weekly income replacement benefit that the deceased would have been entitled to arising out of an accident if the victim had survived it. 4)The Court dismissed the appeal without ordering the court to order costs."

The Commission overturned the decision of the stewards and restored the horse declared to be in first place. In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed. The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record. The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.  3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence. The stewards were not vested with the sole authority to determine whether there was interference at the gate. 4)Knight v. Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual. 5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions. The decision of the Commission to refuse to give the applicants notice of the hearing was patently unreasonable. Their rights were affected by the decision. Bibeault was distinguishable. 6)The applicants were awarded costs.","The applicants were the owners of two horses which were involved in a horse race. The horse which won was disqualified for interference at the gate. The applicants applied for judicial review of the decision of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Commission, which granted an extension of time (for filing an objection) to party that had previously granted the extension. Application allowed; decision quashed; the commission's refusal to give notice of the hearing was patently unreasonable. The court found that the parties were not bound by s. 10.1 of the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act to act fairly when it failed to give the applicants notice of its intention to consider the imposition of conditions on his practice. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision was quashed. 1)The parties were the applicants' owners. 2)The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record. The decision of a commission is patently unreasonably unreasonable. 3)The Commission's failure to give adequate or any notice to the applicants constitutes patently unfair conduct. The Commission's decision to refuse to provide notice is, in the view of the applicants, patently unjust. 4)The Court found that there exists a general right to procedural fairness on the part of public authorities.

The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met. The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them. Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional.

The children had been in temporary care since December 2001 and had been out of their mother's care for approximately one-half of their short lifetime. The Court ordered the mother to cooperate with the completion of a Psychological and Parental Capacity Assessment and general costing clause to allow the assessment to be completed.

The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle.

HELD: 1) The Income Replacement Benefit must reflect a claimant's earning reality. His earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time. The income replacement benefits must reflect his earning reality and the benefits of employment insurance benefits, including any benefits mentioned in s. 20 and 21, where the income is annualized, indexed, and then adjusted pursuant to section 27. The Court was required to make a determination whether the claimant was deprived of an employment insurance benefit in the first 180 days. 2) The legislative intent remains the same as it was in the case of the appellant. The Income replacement benefit must reflect the claimant's earned reality. The earning reality is working for the employment income of a non employee. The adjustment for inclement weather is required. The average work week was 34.25 hours. 3) SGI submits that the weighted average approach in calculating Montgrand's gross yearly employment income (GGYI) sets the IRB much lower than the one used by the appellant in assessing employment insurance claims. 4) The Court found that the appellant was working well for his employer and was working at a wage rate of $16 per hour for the six weeks leading up to the accident. He would have worked 90 of the 180 days and received his full entitlement to employment insurance until it expired on October 24, 1998. The ratio in Dietner is not relevant to this case. The provisions of s. 117 and the corresponding regulations provide the mathematical formula to determine Montgrand’s IRB and the GYEI from which he is derived. The definition of employment income is defined as the income earned by a person who is receiving employment insurance at the time of the accident and received employment insurance in the intervening accident. The Act provides for calculation of IRB for the 1st 180 days, and for the 181st and subsequent days. The application deals with s. 116 and s.115 of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations. The relevant provisions of the act are as follows: 117(1) Subject to subsection (5),"
b_2005nssf21.txt,"The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.",HELD: The parties agreed that a Joint Custody Order was issued and that primary care would remain with the mother. The parties did not seek periodic support but rather a lump sum payment to cover tuition at the Atlantic School of Theology. The mother was prepared to consult but wanted the final say when they could not agree. The court found that the mother had been extensively involved in the operation of the property since marriage and that the couple considered this property to be a joint business operated for the benefit of the family. The children's best interests were served by remaining in the matrimonial home with their father.
b_2008nspc5.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was revoked when he was found operating an all terrain vehicle (ATV) on a highway. Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along a highway. At the time his driver's license was revoked, he was driving a prohibited vehicle on the highway. He was charged with driving a motor vehicle on a highway while his licence was revoked contrary to s.287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act. HELD: The accused was not guilty of driving the motor vehicle while he was lawfully licensed and his charge was dismissed. The use of an ATV on public highways is clearly prohibited under the Motor Vehicles Act. The words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2), do not include an electric vehicle and even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an ATv on the road. The offence was committed while his 'driver's license' was revoked. The defence argued that since there is no nexus between his driving of the ATV and the revocation of his driver’s license he should be guilty of the offence. The only issue at this trial is whether this makes the accused guilty of a driving offence of impaired driving while his license is revoked."
b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The mother applied to vary an order for maintenance for her daughters. She also applied for determination that the father was in arrears of maintenance and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. HELD: Appeal allowed. Even if the circumstances as a whole were construed as a unilateral withdrawal by the daughters, the high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met. The court found that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father and that there would be no order for retroactive maintenance. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted, does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The quality of the parent/child relationship by itself rarely determines the matter. The Court found that it would not be just and equitable to require the father to pay child support unless the situation was extremely grave. The evidence did not demonstrate that the daughter unilaterally withdrew from the father. The trial judge found that there was no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the girls did not seek to maintain or maintain a relationship with him. His finding that they did, in fact, decline to maintain their relationship with their father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. He did not find any error in principle or a significant misapprehension of the evidence with respect to the issue."
b_2010skca58.txt,"The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident. He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial. No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.",The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.

b_2010skqb249.txt,"The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","The plaintiff claims his personal and professional reputation has been seriously damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. HELD: The plaintiff has proven that he was defamed. However, the defendants' defence of qualified privilege is accepted. 1) The plaintiff was the director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) for four years. The VTH operations include approximately 600 faculty, staff and students, an annual budget of $7 million and serve approximately 12,000 members of the public each year. The administrator of the VTH has not only refused to prevent harassment but has been an active part of the harassment himself. 2) There is no basis for jurisdictional defence. 3) The court found that the plaintiff was not defamed but was found to have been defamed by the impugned words."
b_2012skqb443.txt,The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their children. The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner. The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal. HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it. The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it. The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.,"FIAT: The application at bar is another salvo in a bitter custody and access dispute. HELD: 1) Settlement negotiations are protected by settlement privilege which is a jointly held privilege that cannot be waived by any one party acting alone. Just as promised, the letter goes on to set out a detailed, comprehensive offer of settlement. This privilege is fundamental to the policy interest of promoting settlement discussions as means to avoiding trial. It should only be set aside if there is a very compelling, competing policy warranting such a proposal. As settlement communications are almost always irrelevant to the issues that are properly considered by the Court, it is rare that there will be any competing policy or, indeed, any reason to reference them at all. 2) The application to bar is yet another Salvo in the custody/access dispute. The respondent exhibited a letter to his counsel that was from his counsel to the petitioner's counsel. The letter was marked 'Without Prejudice' and began with: 'My proposal is reasonable so must be good, reasonable parent; by failing to accept that reasonable proposal, she must be unreasonable and, therefore, not as good parent.' This is gamesmanship and nothing more. Gamesmanship fouls that which the policy seeks to promote. Relevance of settlement proposals 10) Settlement privilege aside, and with the exception of a few issues such as costs and limitation periods or when party seeks to establish a settlement, the privilege is clearly an important one and in cases of doubt as to whether the correspondence does relate to the negotiations, the Court should err on the side of protecting the privilege."

The accused took no position. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. Making an order for video-conferencing for non- participating persons was not permitted because the Court had no control over the policing of the courtroom in Ontario. It would set a dangerous precedent that could result in multiple applications being made in future trials by numerous interested parties in different jurisdictions over which the Court had no control.","The applicant Government of Saskatchewan, Victim Services Branch, brought a motion before myself as trial judge for an order permitting a live audio/video broadcast of the trial set to proceed from a Court of Queen's Bench courtroom in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, to a courtroom in a court house in the Greater Toronto area, Ontario, for the exclusive benefit of the family of the deceased. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)Although Saskatchewan has developed a protocol for accommodating the participants of a trial process including witnesses, lawyers and judges within the trial process by way of video conferencing, the Court was presented with no case authority in which court has ever made an order allowing video confording for the benefit of specific non-participating persons within Saskatchewan let alone another province. 2)Although this court certainly has inherent jurisdiction to govern its own process within its own court within the province of Saskatchewan it has no jurisdiction to make any orders involving facilities and personnel in the Province of Ontario. It is being suggested that the Victim Services branch in Ontario would be responsible for ensuring that whatever order the Court may make is complied with including the exclusion of cameras and recording devices. 3)The Court was very concerned about the possible ramifications of this application.

b_2016skqb29.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made in 2005. The court assumed that the imputation was correct. The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them. The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","The respondent applies for an order to discontinue his obligation to pay both child and spousal support and for all support arrears to be expunged. He relies upon s. 17 of the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, and s. 14 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. HELD: 1)When dealing with a request to vary, the respondent must accept the original order was correct at the time it was made and allow the payor to escape his obligations if enough time elapses. 2)The respondent has been content to have the existing order in place and did not seek to challenge it by way of trial proceedings to obtain a final order different from that pronounced by McIntyre J. 3)In approaching variation, the applicant is able to establish he has been working full-time for the past 10 years. In those years he earned actual income from full time employment. He has avoided paying anything for considerable period of time. 4)The applicant is entitled to child support for an amount exceeding $220,000. The court must accept that the original Order was correct and expunge the lower income which is said to have been earned by the applicant. 5)The Court must consider whether the original ordered was correct.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs of $1200 to the respondent. 1)The appellant did not commit a fraud in obtaining payment under the policy; she made no wilful false statement. 2)There was no false statement in the proof of loss. There was no breach of the duty of an insured to act in good faith even if that duty extends to the claim stage. 3)The failure to disclose the conversations with the sister did not constitute a fraud. 4)There is no allegation in the statement of claim that there was extortion when there was no evidence before him on which he could make this finding.

For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs.

It is the Province bears the responsibility for the negotiations and payment of rental costs associated with the leases. The issue is whether the Minister of Education (the 'Minister') is required to reimburse the board for the costs incurred by the board in leasing these school buildings from the Church. HELD: 1)Where the Minister has received a request in the proper form and determined, with the approval of the Governor in Council, that it is necessary to lease a school building in order to meet the Province's statutory obligation then the cost of such a lease is the responsibility of the Province. The lease costs are to the same extent as would be the cost for supplying the building free of costs. It would not include those expenses associated with operating the building.

Per Bateman, J.A., dissenting, that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were lacking in probative value. It is left, then, to determine the fitness of the sentence at the time it was made. Taking into account the factors before the sentencing judge, the sentence imposed could not be found to be clearly unreasonable.","The appellant was sentenced to 5 months imprisonment, followed by 18 months probation with conditions including an 18 month period of supervised release. He had been living with his father for 3-4 years and had experimented with LSD and cocaine. During that time, he also experimented with alcohol and cocaine and had an extensive history of daily use. The appellant's parents were concerned about an excessive telephone bill, lack of respect for his friends, and drug use. He was given leave to file affidavit evidence in regard to the appellant's alcohol use since his release and his employment since December 1995. The affidavit from his father was not available to the Court until the morning of the sentence hearing and the Court found that the information contained in the pre-sentence report was inadequate and the appellant had failed to report for his first counselling appointment."
c_1997canlii1639.txt,"This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff went on maternity leave for six months. During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff. The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended. She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause. She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice. Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice, that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice. This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause.","This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal where the plaintiff contends that she was constructively dismissed without notice by her employer, the defendant. HELD: The Court found that an appropriate and proper period of notice was 8 months. The Court also found that the plaintiff had failed to militage and that the employee was awarded damages based on an eight month salary at the rate she was receiving at the time of her employment with the defendant, plus vacation pay of 6 percent per annum. The court also found there was no evidence that the defendant intended to reduce the plaintiff's hours of work by increasing the rate of pay and vacation pay."
c_1998canlii13762.txt,"The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s27 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell them the lands which were subject to their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation. The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution. The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal. There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which were subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant resisted the requested relief on the basis the plaintiffs did not comply with the required time frame. Specifically that they did not meet the requirements set out in s. 28(2)(b) of The Farm Land security Act. HELD: The application for relief was dismissed. 1)The defendant offered a different requirement for the exercise of the right to first refusal in its offer enclosed with the cover letter dated March 24, 1997. In the offer form, it did not require that it be forwarded a letter of commitment directly from a recognized financial institution. It simply required that the plaintiffs 'provide' such a letter. 2)The plaintiff counterclaimed against the defendant for rent it claims owing from the plaintiffs as mover holding tenants. 3)Costs of the action were also dismissed."
c_1999canlii12484.txt,"In issue was whether the law firm was in a conflict of interest with respect to two matrimonial files and whether the firm could remain as counsel for the spouses. HELD: 1)A lawyer with Olive Waller acts as counsel for Janie Magnes and Daniel L'Heureux. The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm. At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes. She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses. 2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case. There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur. There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening. Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her. The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet. The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter. The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs.","This is an application for a determination as to whether the law firm of Olive, Waller, Zinkhan & Waller is in a position of conflict of interest with respect to the matrimonial files of Magnes v. Magnes and D.A.L. and whether the firm may remain as counsel for the plaintiffs in those proceedings. HELD: The screen is sufficient in the circumstances of this case and there is not a risk of real mischief in this case. While Hunter Miller's concerns are legitimate and should be taken seriously, on behalf of their clients, the Olive Waller firm has put in place many of the screening measures suggested by the Guidelines in the Code. The screening measures, with the exception of the computer file segregation occurred prior to the arrival of the applicant. The instructions to firm members of the restrictions being placed on all firm members regarding the conflicting files carried with them the implicit notice of sanctions in the event the policy was not adhered to."
c_1999skqb230.txt,"The applicant asserted the third party (the respondent's father's company) paid $55,000 to the respondent's company in contravention of the June 7, 1999 order which directed any funds accruing to the company be paid into court and froze any money to be paid out. The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial. The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access. The applicant had been prohibited in a 1998 order from removing the children from Saskatchewan without a court order, absent consent.HELD: 1)The issue of the payments was directed to trial and pre-trial conference to be held in January. 2)The mother was granted leave to move the children to Alberta. Their primary residence was to continue to be with her. She was encouraged to attain self-sufficiency. Access was to be maintained and the mother was ordered to return the children to Saskatchewan for purposes of allowing the respondent to exercise access in accordance with existing orders. Additional access was granted provided he picked up and returned the children to the applicant's residence. 3)The 1998 interim order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home was not changed. The applicant was at liberty to rent the home. 4)The applicant was directed to take all reasonable steps to sell the recreational trailer in her possession and to pay the sale proceeds to the bank to discharge the lien and the balance into court. She was to file an affidavit of bona fides as to the sale which should relieve her of the obligation for payment of the loan.  5)Costs were reserved to the trial.","The applicant asserts that the respondent's father's company (the third party) paid $55,000 to the third party in contravention of the order of the court directing funds to be paid into court, and freezing any money that was paid into the court. HELD: The children were to remain with the applicant. Pursuant to an interim possession and exclusive use order, the primary residence was with the respondent. The status quo as to access should also be maintained. The applicant returned the children to Saskatchewan for purposes of exercise of access by the respondent in accordance with existing orders. The court ordered access to the respondent for that purpose, provided, on such occasion, the respondent will pick up and return the children. 1)The applicant was directed to pay $800 from the bank and $9 from the mortgage. 2)The court granted the applicant leave to remove the children from Medicine Hat; their primary residence would thereby continue. 3)The status quo of access should be maintained as the respondent was granted additional access to include Thursday or Monday, when the weekend falls on a statutory holiday and the applicant was prohibited from removing the children without court order, absent consent. 4)The Court directed that the applicant receive an affidavit of indebtedness and possession of the property and that she be directed to sell the property. 5)The application for interim possession should be directed at trial and to pre-trial conference to be held on January 26, 2000. 6)Costs of the sale should be reserved to the applicant and the court directed that all proceeds from sales be reserved at the bank."
c_2002skca122.txt,Appeals of sentence and conviction on the grounds the transcripts of court proceedings were not available; the court would not subpoena certain witnesses on his behalf; his state of mind when he made the telephone calls exonerated him. HELD: The appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed. The judge made no error in ruling that all of the evidence from the prospective witnesses and transcripts was irrelevant as being unrelated to the charges and too remote in time. The appellant's state of mind was adequately established by his own evidence and the summation to the jury. The defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it. The sentence appeal was moot since it was limited to time served while awaiting trial. The Court would have found the sentence to be fit in any event.,"The accused gave evidence at his own trial about his encounters with the RCMP which caused him to be fearful of them. He testified that he had filed numerous complaints against the members of the RCMP and these were being investigated. He alleged that he was seriously assaulted and injured during one of those encounters. He also alleged that his RCMP contacts had caused him a mental health crisis. HELD: The appeal against both conviction and sentence was dismissed.  1)The Court read the notice of appeal, the relevant portions of the trial proceedings and the Crown factum prior to hearing your arguments today. 2)The court found that all of the evidence to be derived from these sources was irrelevant to the charges against the accused."
c_2002skca74.txt,"The appellant was unsuccessful in Queen's Bench in having his suspension and probation as a medical resident rescinded or to prohibit the Investigation Committee, which met on approximately seven occasions and interviewed seven witnesses, from taking further action. The Chambers judge refused to grant relief, finding the issues to be academic in nature and within the exclusive jurisdiction of the University, but ruled his supervisor should be removed from the Committee because of an apprehension of bias. The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure. He argued all committee members, except the union representative, should be excluded by reason of bias. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. 1)The material did not meet the test for the admission of fresh evidence. It simply restated what was at issue and found to have had no effect. 2)There was no tenable basis for interfering. The remedies are discretionary. 3)The Court was not prepared to grant the relief in any event, given the long delay in seeking recourse. The initial concern was bias and jurisdiction. The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below. 4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations. Proceedings should not be allowed to be fragmented and should be allowed to run their course so the court has a complete record from the tribunals below. Certiorari should not be granted where there is a right of appeal, except in exceptional circumstances.","The medical resident applied to have his suspension and probation as medical resident rescinded and to prohibit the Investigation Committee established to look into the matter from taking further action. An appeal committee was struck pursuant to the provisions of the College of Medicine, Regulations for Dealing with Unsatisfactory Evaluations and Disciplinary Action Part. He appealed the resulting order from the Queen's Bench Chambers judge. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. 1)There was no tenable basis for interfering with the Chambers judge's disposition of the application. The remedies prayed for are discretionary by nature, the writs being writs of grace. Thus the appellant must demonstrate he abused his discretion. He must demonstrate the chambers judge abused the discretion of his discretion and the result is not so plainly wrong as to warrant intervention (see Rimmer v. Adshead). 2)The application was premature as there were other avenues of appeal open to the appellant. Given the long delay, including the delay in seeking recourse, including a hearing on the appeal committee's decision to strike, and the fact that the committee's minutes were forwarded to the Associate Dean of Postgraduate Medical Education who ruled the issues should be dealt with under Part B of the regulations, the decision of which was not made by the college of medicine."
c_2002skqb155.txt,"The wife sought distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. HELD: The petitioner was given judgment for $51,725.82 with taxable costs of the action payable within 3 months, failing which, the petitioner may apply for directions as to sale of the family property. The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm. The petitioner's claim for $1,000, borrowed from a friend to pay legal fees, was not considered a matrimonial debt.","The petitioner sought a distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. The parties cohabited for some 2½ years and then divorced in 2000. After seven years and three children, they separated in 2001. They carried on a mixed farming operation. The respondent did the major part of the farm work with the petitioner providing assistance. The petitioner worked off the farm until 1996 when he began to provide that service from the farm. HELD: 1) The petitioner was awarded judgment against the respondent in the amount of $51,725.82 together with taxable costs of the action. 2) The respondent owned a Case 800 tractor and a J.D. 400 mix mill. Prior to the marriage, the petitioner owned two cows and one cow. 3) There was a claim for $16,500 which was said to be owing to the father in respect to the Versatile 160 tractor. In the past, the respondent has owned several vehicles which he sold and then purchased other vehicles, including trucks. However, as best I can make out, it was acquired prior to marriage. Accordingly, the Court treated it as being exempt. 4) In the circumstances, the family property should be divided equally. 5) An RRSP registered in the name of the respondent was used to pay for the farm machinery. 6) The farm machinery was owned by the respondent prior to his marriage. He did not contest either of the cows or cow. 7) The interest earned would not be exempt, but have no evidence as to what that has been. 8) There were additional debts as follows which the respondent can hardly be heard to say he owes money for. The amount which is available for distribution is $5,570. [9] The respondent submitted a large number of debts and expenses which he submits should be taken into account. Both are statute barred and the father is not convinced this is actually owing and therefore reject it.  10) Over a period of time the respondent sold his tractor and the sale proceeds of $12,000 were used to purchase the acreage. He now claims an exemption in that amount. 11) There are several other pieces of machinery which are not in dispute and it is here that there is a serious dispute regarding the number of machines and what value should be attributed to the equipment which is subject to distribution.  12) There is a debt of $1,200 owed to the respondent for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance.  13) The amount of interest earned is $2"
c_2002skqb508.txt,"A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","The Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of food services at the University of Saskatchewan. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties failed. The employer advised the Board that it was not prepared to make the agreement retroactive. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)The employer was a merchant. His products were priced in such a way as to reflect in part the labour costs involved in delivering them to the public. The decision to allow the graduated employees to receive their back pay was not patently unreasonable in that it denied the parties natural justice and procedural fairness in respect of the wage retroactivity to employees who had left the employ of the employer prior to the Board's order. 2)The issue of retroactivity was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions and arguments and would seem contrary to curial deference and to reason. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would have been meaningless. 3)The importance of a wage rise, retroactive and rather substantial if viewed as a percentage would seem to be prejudicial. 4)The court found that to set aside the orders of the Board on the grounds that their decisions are patently unreasonably unreasonable and to elevate this issue to the point where a rehearing would be required would seem counter productive."
c_2003skqb58.txt,"Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act. The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision. The Crown did not seek costs.","The plaintiffs apply for certification of an action under The Class Actions Act on behalf of the following classes as set forth in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim: (a) Veterans Resident Class Any Indian person who, as defined by the Indian Act, was not informed of or was offered any benefits that were entitled to by reason of their service in World War I, World War II or the Korean War and/or their dependants who received some or all of the veteran benefits. HELD: The action was dismissed as statute-barred. 1) There were a number of limitations issues, including the length and complexity of the issues, the novelty of the cause of action, and the potential for the defendant to present a strong defence. 2) The plaintiffs were persons whose same sex partner had died before January 1, 1998 and after the enactment of the Charter in 1985. The lengthy delay between the plaintiff's awareness of the symptoms in 1976 and her suit in 1993 could not simply be due to lack of a medical-legal report. The issue at the certification stage is whether the plaintiffs are statute barred from receiving the Survivors' Pensions that they seek. 3) The Court reviewed the issues and concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that the pleadings disclose a cause. The Court concluded that there was no bar to the bringing of these motions even at the pre-certification stage of the proceedings. 4) The test in Canada governing the application of provisions like Rule 19(24)(a) of the British Columbia Rules of Court is the same as the one that governs an application under R.S.C. O. 18, r. 19; assuming that the class members succeed in this litigation and reach the bureaucratic stage of applying for individual Survivors' Pension, will the question of individual issues arise."
c_2004skca153.txt,"The respondent was convicted after trial of fraud exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.

He also made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The learned judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1) of the Code. The sentence imposed did not properly reflect the principle of deterrence or the gravity of the offence. 2) This was a serious fraud accomplished by what the judge called a rather intricate kiting system.",The Court granted a conditional discharge with a probation order of 1 year and a requirement of 200 hours of community service work and a 12 month conditional sentence was substituted in place of the conditional discharge. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The Provincial Court judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The sentence imposed did not reflect the gravity of the offence. The conditional discharge would do little to discourage others in Mr. Roberts' situation from undertaking similar sorts of criminal activity. 2)The sentence imposed was not properly reflected the gravity and the offence was a serious fraud accomplished by virtue of what the judge called 'a rather intricate kiting system'. A 12-month conditional sentence substituted in the place of a 1 year conditional discharge was substituted. 3)Leave to appeal was granted and the Crown's appeal should be allowed.

The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused. As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). An initial question was whether the trial judge's decision quoted above reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for impaired driving. HELD: The entry of a judicial stay on the.08 charge was not used to avoid a multiple conviction issue. Volume of consumption falls within the provisions of s. 253(b). The mechanism for doing so is the entering of judicial stays on the charge that is less serious when convicting of the more serious. However, the judge concluded that the erratic driving pattern, his unsteadiness and fumbling, coupled with his admissions and odour of alcohol were matters which, if accepted by properly instructed finder of facts, could have resulted in conviction. The judge relied on the readings contained in the Certificate of Analysis; consideration by the breathalyzer readings; and the conditional stay was dissolved."

HELD: 1) The child completed grade 12 in 2004 having turned 18 in February. He returned to high school in the fall of 2004. He worked at McDonald's during that year and lived with his mother. Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media. He is still under his mother's charge. She provides him with room and board. He is only 19 years old.

This will continue until March 2006 when he has completed his current course of study. 2) The respondent's income fluctuates. It is appropriate to take an average of the last 3 years to determine his income.  3) Some attention must be paid to the financial ability of each parent to contribute. After deducting the table amount, the respondent would have a gross annual income of $19,781.52. On that basis the court was not prepared, even in the face of some shortfall for the child, to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts.

Application for summary judgment granted. The evidence showed that only an offer to lease had been made, with no lease agreement ever having actually been signed, and that the individual with whom the landlord had dealt was only intended to be a guarantor and never a tenant.","Pricewaterhouse retained Allan Henderson as a contractual agent to value and liquidate the assets in favour of the creditors of Alternative Sports Limited pursuant to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and when he attended at the premises he found that the inventory was being loaded into a van and he was unable to gain possession of the assets. HELD: The defendant was granted summary judgment including a declaration with respect to the inventory and the existing order to continue with damages to be determined and assessed in due course. The facts based on the evidence by County Realty Limited, Muller very clearly was only intended to be a guarantor and the lease prepared by county Realty along with the evidence of Snow and the statement of legal fees strongly advances Muller's position that he was only a tenant.

They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","The defendant GMCL moves for an order for summary judgment on evidence to dismiss the claims made by two of the plaintiffs, Steven and Jody, alleging that the motor vehicle accident which occurred on October 1998 was caused by an inherent defect in the design and manufacture of the vehicle being driven by the other plaintiff, Maria Johansson. The two plaintiffs were injured in a single vehicle accident while passengers in a vehicle driven by Johansson and were paid damages for the injuries they sustained as result of the releases given to Citadel General Assurance Company. Both the plaintiff and the defendant, GMCL, accepted payment in full and final settlement of any claims they had for damages arising from the accident that spawned the current action. They should not now expect to be compensated further, particularly where to pursue a claim could result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. To allow their action to proceed would be an abuse of this Court's process."
c_2013skpc37.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08. The accused was permitted to use his cell phone on the way to the RCMP detachment to call his wife in Calgary and request help in finding a lawyer. He did not receive a call back from his wife. The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available. The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid. After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.' The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value. The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call. The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape. The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio. The video was taped over every 60 days and had been destroyed before it was requested by defence counsel. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. Even though the accused's cell phone was taken from him before he received a call back from his wife, it is clear that the accused made a conscious decision to call Legal Aid, and by implication, did not wish to pursue the first course of action. There was no obligation on the part of the RCMP to provide the accused with a Prosper warning. The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult with another lawyer. The officer was justified in assuming that the accused was satisfied with the legal advice he had received. The Crown stayed the impaired driving count prior to the conclusion of the trial. The videotape evidence was not relevant to the .08 offence because all observations were made at roadside. The video would not have shown anything of relevance to the charge. There is no breach of the accused's rights under s. 7. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted into evidence and the accused was convicted of the .08 charge.","The accused was stopped by an RCMP officer shortly after driving away from a bar/restaurant. The accused blew a test on the approved screening device and was taken to Carlyle where samples of breath were obtained with readings of 130 mgs and 120 mgs. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's right to counsel. 1)There was no evidence that the accused had initiated a procedure for obtaining legal advice which clearly could not be pursued once his cell phone was taken away. 2)The accused made a conscious decision to consult with Legal Aid and, by implication, did not wish to pursue his first course of action. In this situation there was no obligation on the police officer to provide the accused with a warning. 3)The removal of the cell phone does give some pause for thought in that he may have initiated a process whereby he may not have pursued his first action. 4)The destruction of video evidence does not relieve the accused of his right to an answer and defence. 5)It is clear from the evidence the accused made his conscious decision not to consult Legal Aid. The concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood. 6)The video evidence was destroyed to prevent the accused from contacting legal counsel. 7)The Court found no evidence of a breach of his rights under s.10(b)."
c_2016skqb269.txt,"HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","The accused was charged under the Canada Labour Code with failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee by failing to instruct him on how to unplug a receiving pit. The employee died shortly after entering the pit. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1) The mass of material emphasized the dangers, and the importance of following the safety procedures, rather than burying them. The Court of Appeal's approval of these remarks did not accept the Crown's position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proves the actus reus of failing to protect an employee. 2) The evidence of the employee was not buried in the mass of other information. 3) There were many photos, drawings and words in the material. The information was not understandable, however, and there remains the prospect of the defence of due diligence applying to them."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","The accused was convicted of dangerous driving and assault. The trial judge found that the accused intentionally drove in a manner which he knew created a danger for others, and drove a manner intended to scare the complainant. She was entitled to conclude from the appellant's intentional action that his conduct was a marked departure from the conduct expected of a reasonably prudent driver and not a momentary lapse. HELD: The appeal from the dangerous driving conviction was dismissed. 1)The trial judge made no error on the de minimis issue. There was nothing in the transcript which suggested the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach in rendering her decision. 2)There was no evidence upon which a trier of fact properly instructed could have reasonably reached the conclusion she did."
d_1991canlii4237.txt,"In this divorce action the petitioner sought to have a separation agreement entered into by the parties incorporated into the corollary relief judgment. The respondent sought to have the separation agreement set aside on the grounds of duress, undue influence or unconscionsability. The couple had a traditional marriage. The petitioner earned $48,000 per year. The wife did not work outside the home and suffered from severe arthritis. For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","The parties entered into a separation agreement in 1989 that permitted the husband to retain the matrimonial home with an equal division of net proceeds if it were to be sold in the future. The agreement provided for all outstanding issues between the parties. The maintenance provisions of the agreement were far from being unconscionable, unduly harsh or fraudulent. It was an extremely fair and indeed an unequal division in her favor. The Husband and Wife covenant and agree that it is not subject to review. Matrimonial Property Act, Section 29(1)(d) cannot be used to vary maintenance provision, jurisdiction for which lies soley under the Divorce Act of Canada. An action under the Matrimonial Property Act is a separate action. This represents joinder of actions as permitted under Civil Procedure Rule 57.04 and it does not confer or transfer any jurisdiction one from the other."
d_1991canlii4322.txt,"A complaint was lodged against the applicant police officer that she had been discourteous to the victim of a sexual assault and that she had lied about being granted permission to attend a meeting held to investigate the assault. The applicant was given written notice of the substance of both allegations according to the disciplinary procedure set out in the regulations made pursuant to the Police Act, but in the space provided for the citation the notice cited only the regulation which dealt with the offense of being discourteous. A hearing before an inspector of the Police Department resulted in the applicant being found guilty of the offense of lying. She initiated a review by the Police Review Board which concluded that the section reference in the charge did not have to be accurate. The applicant brought this proceeding for judicial review and submitted that the Board's jurisdiction was limited by the citation of a particular regulation and to finding her guilty of the behaviour described in the regulation cited. Dismissing the application, that the failure to cite what the Board considered the proper offense in no way materially affected the procedural fairness of the hearings or limited the Board's jurisdiction. The applicant had complete notice of the nature of the allegations against her and was represented by counsel at the Board hearing. Certiorari will not issue for mere technical or trivial oversights and there was nothing patently unreasonable about the decision such as would warrant judicial intervention. On appeal","At issue in this case was whether a police officer may overturn a decision made against her by the Police Review Board for the reason that the Regulation number by which she was charged did not precisely correspond to the number for which she had been found guilty. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1)The failure to refer to what the Review Board considered the 'proper' offense in the original complaint was a technical defect only, and in no way materially affected the procedural fairness of the proceedings. 2)There was no denial of natural justice if the direction in the footnote to Form 12 was interpreted as a legislative provision limiting the tribunal's powers. Rather, regard it as merely procedure in the disciplinary process which the Board has express legislative authority to supercede, by virtue of s. 33(1)(h). 3)There is nothing which persuades me that the Board's decision is patently unreasonable. It is clear from review of all of the forms completed, including Form 12, that the allegations made against the officer included the allegation that she lied to the complainants during the course of the investigation. The fact that the officer was given notice of the alleged disciplinary default and that it was framed in terms of default 5(1)g)(iii) did not change the fact that she was not charged with any other disciplinary default. 4)The Board was free to substitute what it felt to be the appropriate section number and conclude, in the circumstances, that Constable White was guilty of the disciplinary default referred to in the police report."

d_1996canlii6756.txt,The plaintiff was to build and supply to the defendants a ready to move home (RTM). The plaintiff alleged the contract price was in error and sought rectification of the contract. The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had. HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed. 1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted. He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest.

At issue was were whether the arbitrator applied the correct measure of damages and whether there was any evidence to support the findings of fact. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed. The respondent's application for enforcement of the award was granted without costs. 1)The issues were questions of fact not law. The errors complained of were the same questions referred to the arbitrator for determination. Adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' did not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law. The wording on the second issue was changed slightly to read 'in his calculation as to damages awarded for increased costs of winter construction'. There was some evidence upon which the arbitrator could make a finding of fact. 2)As none of the bars set out in the Act applied the court was required by s50(3) to give judgment enforcing the award.  3)The application for costs on a solicitor and client basis was denied.

d_1997canlii11439.txt,"The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The petitioner sought an order under The Dependents' Relief Act (DRI) varying child maintenance from $150 per child to $1,245 per month for the two children.

HELD: The maintenance was to be paid monthly and the children were to have their personal effects, other than farm machinery, to convey to the children upon their attaining the age of twenty-one years. There was nothing within the will, read as a whole,with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term 'personal effects' to be given anything other than its ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the Testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles.

It was important that he be reintroduced to his 10 year old daughter in a gradual and consistent fashion. He was granted access intitially for three and four hours in both provinces, then two days at the father's parent's home including overnight access and two days in the summer in British Columbia.

d_2001nsca44.txt,"The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death, causing death in the operation of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and causing bodily harm while under the influence of alcohol. The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury. Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial. Finally, there were no errors by the judge on any of the other grounds advanced for appeal.","Following a trial in the Supreme Court, before Justice Simon MacDonald and a jury, the appellant was convicted of four offences arising out of her operation of a motor vehicle. The appellant appeals her conviction and raises numerous grounds of appeal. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The appellant's right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been violated by Officer Towle when he failed to advise the appellant of the full extent of her legal jeopardy. 2) There was no medical reason to keep the appellant at the hospital. The officer testified that he did not detect any odour of alcohol from the appellant on the day of the accident. 3) The evidence from the accident scene did not support the appellant's contention that the jury's verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. 4) The Court reviewed the evidence from both the trial and the trial judge and found that the appellant’s right to retain and instruct counsel without delay was violated. The Court found that there was no evidence of impairment to the appellant. 5) The court found that it could be said with the highest degree of probability that; 1) there was a mechanical defect in either vehicle that could have caused or contributed to the collision. The only person who was injured was the appellant, who was alone in her car and she remembered nothing of the circumstances of that accident. 6) It would be helpful to examine the evidence to establish the impact of the breach upon the refusal charge in his attempt to fashion remedy."
d_2005skca149.txt,"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. The Crown appealed her decision and argued that, on a proper reading of the YCJA, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. HELD: Appeal allowed. The Youth Court judge found that the youth’s sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. She concluded that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and community supervision order because the sentence had expired.  1) Section 102(2) of the Youth Code states that a judge may suspend the conditional supervision and order that the young person be remanded to any youth custody facility that the provincial director considers appropriate until review is conducted. 2) Section 107 (apprehension) and 108 (review by provincial director) apply, with any modifications that the circumstances require, to an order under s. 103 of the Code. Section 107(1) incorporates only the “apprehensions” aspect of s. 107 because that is all it refers to. 3) Section 103(2)(a) includes the word “Apprehension” after the reference to s.107. It is included in s.102(2). 4) Section 104(1)(b) incorporates the same wording as s.103(2), which “the circumstances require” when it applies in the context of breach of community supervision orders. It also provides that, until a young person is apprehended, he or she is deemed to be continuing to serve the youth sentence the youth is serving. 5) Sections 107 and 108 apply with necessary modifications. Section 103 provides for appeals not just from an order but also from refusal to make an order. This proviso cannot have been intended to incorporate the power to suspend which is provided for under a separate section. These sections may allow the issuance of a warrant authorizing apprehension, as that is the focus of s102(1), and may direct the director to review the case promptly, as the focus is on s.108, but they cannot incorporate the Power to suspend."
d_2005skqb424.txt,"FIAT: In December 2000, the medical review panel of the Workers' Compensation Board of Saskatchewan decided that the applicant was not fit for work. On January 2005, the Board's appeals committee upheld a 2004 decision of the Board's case management division that the applicant was fit for employment. Although the applicant has another avenue of appeal available to him within the workers' compensation system, he takes the position that the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction, so that there is no proper decision from which to appeal, leaving him with an application for judicial review as his only remedy. HELD: Whether or not the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction and consequently are a nullity, the applicant has an adequate alternative remedy available to him. No special circumstances that might justify judicial intervention at this time have been presented. An order in the nature of certiorari is not available to him because he has not yet pursued his right of appeal. The application is dismissed.","FIAT. Whether or not each of the impugned decisions was made without jurisdiction and consequently is a nullity, Mr. Galger has an adequate alternative remedy available to him. HELD: The application was dismissed.

d_2006nssc26.txt,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.","At the time of the motor vehicle accident, the plaintiffs were living in common law relationship and they had spent the evening visiting various bars and pubs in celebration of birthdays of relatives. The defendant's motor vehicle was stopped at a red light. The plaintiffs claimed the defendant's police vehicle was not in operation when it approached the intersection and that the plaintiff was contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 a.m. The plaintiff was driving directly through the intersection on a green light. At the intersection, the defendant was operating a police vehicle and the plaintiff's headlights were in operation. The defendants claim the headlights of the defendant’s vehicle were not inoperable when it was approached by traffic control lights. The Court found that up to the time the accident occurred, the defendants’ vehicle was in operation and the plaintiffs’ headlights were on when the vehicle crossed the intersection. HELD: 1) When the plaintiffs moved for finding the defendant not qualified to express opinions on the operation or non-operation of the police vehicle, the Court permitted further evidence from the witness to determine if he was capable of expressing his opinion in his testimony. When the Court found there was not presented evidence which established the officer was qualified, it found that he was not entitled to express his opinion. 2) When it was time for the Court to hear further evidence, it could be said that the defendant had not been properly trained in the area and that he had not followed the directions and recommendations in the manual."
d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","This was an application for an order in the nature of certiorari relating to the issuance of a search warrant on May 3, 2005. The application alleged that the applicant, an accountant, filed fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund, and misreported HST sales. The applicant sought an ancillary relief of declaration that his rights under ss. and of the Charter were infringed. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The applicant's own evidence supports the inference that he would not have pursued a warrant without paragraphs 20-23 in the Information.  2)The evidence did not rise above the level of'suspicion' to make out reasonable and probable grounds for a warrant to search the applicant's (and his wife's) home.  3)The court found that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias and that the learned justice of the peace erred in concluding that the necessary grounds existed for the search. The fact that he was advised by the applicant that she did not appear as an employee on the T4 summary did not necessarily give rise to reasonable apprehension. 4)The Court found that the respondent was more comfortable omitting information that he now knew to be erroneous."
d_2007nspc68.txt,"The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code; and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration of his blood exceeded eighty milligrams in one hundred milliliters of blood contrary to ss.253(b). HELD: The accused was found not guilty of either offence. 1) The accused's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building; the parking brake was engaged; the engine was in first gear and the transmission was not running. 2) There was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or becoming a danger to the public. There was no risk of the accused changing his mind.  3) The only issue was whether or not the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care or control of his motor vehicle at the relevant time."
d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","HELD: The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. The Ministry requested a 6 month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. HELD: 1) The mother was the father of the children. Although the father was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born, both the children were the subject of a consent order for six months on October 2, 2007. Both the children have been in care for most of their lives. The father was to reside with the mother and the children while the mother attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he proposes to address his own addiction problems. 2) The father proposed that he will continue living with his mother while she first attends to her parenting classes and take anger management courses. The mother supports the position of the father who asks that the children be returned to him in his care. 3) The evidence showed that the father had a substantial criminal record. His youth offences were primarily property crimes, motor vehicle offences, and failures to comply with recognizance and probation orders. He was apprehended at birth as was the mother. The evidence also showed that he had a number of previous convictions related to marijuana possession and possession of drugs. The court reviewed the evidence and concluded that the evidence was insufficient to support the father’s position."
d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The plaintiff brought a motion to dismiss the claim against it on the basis that the defendant failed to provide basic water services at various Holguin resorts. The motion sought to have the plaintiff cross-examine the defendant regarding other customers who might have booked through her office with the defendant. The plaintiff sought to compel the defendant to provide notice to all persons who had, to date, received the package. The defendant argued that the pre-certification notice was unnecessary and could lead to a multitude of issues such as production of documents and undertakings and so forth. The examination may even end up being more broad ranging than that and could be an attempt via Ms. Moore to get information from Red Seal itself as to its customer data base that Red Seal may have regarding customers that may have booked with Red Seal during the relevant time of this case. HELD: The application for examination was dismissed. 1) This is still an 'action' and not a 'class action'. The action is defined under s. 14 of the Class Actions Act as meaning 'an action that defined the Queen's Bench Act, 1998' and Class Action is defined as an action certified not as class action pursuant to Part II. 2) The wording of s. 12 of the Ontario Class Proceedings Act creates a concern about the suspension of time limitations for actions that are eventually certified. The Court is not prepared to broaden the scope of Ottenbreit J.'s decision to allow for examination of the plaintiff. 3) It is important to remember that we are in the precertification stage of this proceeding. The court has taken into consideration Mr. Merchant's comments about his interpretation of Hoffman vs. Haines. It would appear that the court is concentrating more on common law regarding the preliminary conflict objection. 4) The Court's inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised judicially and only when the relief sought cannot reasonable and realistically be obtained by the applications in some other lawful manner. It is not necessary for me to get into the whole issue of examination of witnesses prior to certification. 5) There is no reference by the Court to s.14 or 24 of The Class Action Act to make any order of this kind. 6) The court is not ready to broaden its scope of this decision. The usual practices and application of the common law apply. The practices and the implementation of the Rules of Court do not get suspended merely because this matter has been brought under The Class Actions act. 7) The Moore affidavit is not to challenge her version of the circumstances leading up to the"
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. The respondent was 60 years old and the appellant was 53. The parties had separated in 2003 after 24 years of marriage following two years of cohabitation. They had two adult children, born in 1984 and 1989 respectively. After the separation, the respondent had taken a buyout of her pension and job in exchange for $35,000. Although the respondent was no longer on medication, she testified that she was disabled and did not know when she would be able to work 40 hours per week. She also had health problems and was receiving social assistance. The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining the respondent on the basis she was over 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student. The order was permanent and no further review was fixed. The appellant appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The respondent's application for spousals support was set aside.  2) The court reviewed the judgment of Ottenbreit J. (2008 SKQB 222 (CanLII)). The Court found that the appellant had not engaged in gainful employment at all during the year following the order. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over four months out of Canada, living in Hawaii part of the time and spending a month-long vacation in Jamaica. She paid for her adult children to visit her. 3) The appellant had assumed substantial portion of her support. The evidence before the Court established that he was unable to become self sufficient. He had made no effort to do so within the year allocated by the Court and prior to the filing of the notice of motion, and had little effort between that time and the hearing of the application. The Court discounted the relevant expenses of keeping the respondent over 18 without determining if she was a child or a full-time student. He found the appellant's income to be $38,964.37. This was an error, as it failed to take into account employment expenses of $8,822 allowed by Canada Revenue Agency and expressly found by the chambers judge to be reasonable. The proper income for the appellant, who still had the same medical issues and the couples' daughter Catherine was still living with him and going to university full time, was still in the neighbourhood of $30,000 for the respondent."

The offer was not accepted and the matter proceeded to trial. A week after the trial was concluded and while the decision was reserved, the offer was revoked. The petitioner applies for costs against the respondent pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184B. HELD: Queen's Bench Rule 184B calls for double costs from the date of service of the offer. The fact the offer was revoked does not alter the concept in Rule 184B and the resulting sanction. The petitioner was awarded party to party costs under Column 3 up to September 14, 2010 and double party of party costs under Column 3 thereafter, together with the costs for this application. All costs were payable forthwith.","The petitioner served the respondent with a formal offer of settlement on September 14, 2010. The offer was not accepted (and indeed never was accepted) and the case proceeded to trial. About a week after the conclusion of the trial, the petitioner revoked his offer.

HELD: Rather than filing an appeal, the respondent should have pursued a remedy in Queen's Bench. The proper procedure would have been to apply under Queen's Bench Rule 271 to have the matter opened up and disposed of on the basis of the evidence. The matter was adjourned sine die with leave to bring the matter back to Court if the appellant is unsuccessful at Queen's Bench.","The applicant obtained an order for possession pursuant to s. 3(3) of The Recovery of Possession of Land Act.

The proposed appellant did not appear on that application and the order was made in her absence. Rather than filing a Notice, the applicant filed a Notice alleging certain facts with respect to why the order ought not to have been made.

d_2012skca52.txt,"The accused was convicted of four counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown had proceeded by indictment and the accused was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 8 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20-year Sexual Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) compliance order. At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order. If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3). Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who committed multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or altogether.","The Crown's appeal from the sentencing judge's order under s.490.012(1) of the Criminal Code, which directed the appellant to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) for 20 years, is allowed. The appellant was convicted on each of four charges of sexual assault (s.271(1)). As the Crown proceeded by indictment, he was subject to imprisonment for term not exceeding ten years on each conviction. He was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 4 years and 8 months imprisonment (after four months credit for time served on remand) and he received a ten-year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20-year SOIRA compliance order. HELD: The appeal is allowed orally. 1) The narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1) is not necessary. If Parliament had intended to narrow the application by the narrow application rendered by the sentence judge, the Court unanimously found that Parliament would have used the same language in s.476.013 as it did in s476.012. 2) The order must be set aside and replaced with a lifetime SOIra compliance order which is mandatory in these circumstances. Albeit Mr. Burns had been convicted of more than one 'designated offence', the sentence is concomitantly pronounced for multiple 'designation' convictions and the offender's criminal record discloses no prior convictions for a 'designate offence'. The duration of SO IRA compliance is determined by reference to s.485.013 of the Code. An order made under subsection 490.012 (1) or (2) ends 20 years after it was made if the maximum term of imprisonment for the offence is 10 or 14 years; and (2).1) Duration of the order applies for life if the person is convicted of, or found not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder for, more than a one offence referred to in paragraph (a), (c)c.1), (d) or 'e' of the definition of a 'Designated offence' is 10 years. The Court rejected the appellant's application to have his sentence reduced to 20 years and instead ordered him to comply for 20."
d_2016skca156.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure.","The accused was found guilty of conspiring with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 465(1) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46, and trafficking in cocaine (and trafficking in steroids). He appeals his conviction only. HELD: The Court found that the trial judge erred in failing to grant an adjournment of the trial to allow a review of recently disclosed and discovered documents. The Court ordered a new trial. The accused appealed his conviction. 1) The Court reviewed the documents and found that they were not relevant. 2) The court found that to allow the conviction to stand in the face of all relevant circumstances would amount to miscarriage of justice. 3) There were 27 additional documents not previously disclosed in the combined forces database that would trigger a disclosure obligation."

There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support. If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced. The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support.","The appellant applies pursuant to Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules for an order staying execution of spousal support arrears created as a result of an interim order. The appellant’s application to impose a stay with respect to enforcement of the retroactive Spousal Support Arrears was allowed. That stay was in place until the hearing of the appeal. HELD: The application to lift the stay of proceeding was granted. The court reviewed the circumstances of the parties, including their incomes, expenses, financial obligations (payment of family debt) and the fact they share custody of their son. The Court found that the appellant had a very limited means and thus there was a real possibility she would not be able to repay any “overpayment” of support.  1) Costs were left to the panel hearing the appeal and to determine the outcome of the application. 2) The Court reviewed the evidence before it and concluded that the Chambers judge was correct in finding that the respondent was making significant payments with regard to the family home to cover the mortgage, taxes, insurance and utilities. 3) There was an arguable issue regarding the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousals and the quantum of that support given the circumstances. If the order is enforced, the appellant may be prejudiced."
d_2016skpc19.txt,"HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming.

d_2018skpc6.txt,"HELD: On the basis of the evidence presented by the parties’ experts and in absence of an express term in the contract, the court read in an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price and awarded the plaintiff such portion of the amount sought as was fair and reasonable. The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work.","Reliable Truck Trailer, a mobile vehicle and associated equipment repair company, entered into an oral agreement with the defendant in which it agreed to provide, on a 'call out' basis, repair services for the defendant's fleet of trucks. When required, it would also provide shop supplies and parts to effect those services. During the relationship, the defendant paid the plaintiff's invoices as they were presented, but ceased to pay as they became due. Eventually, the plaintiff demanded payment of its outstanding invoicing and the defendant offered a much smaller sum of money in satisfaction of accounts. HELD: A fair and reasonable price to be paid for the goods and services provided by the plaintiff to the defendant for the period of time for which the plaintiff went unpaid equates to $10,902.32. The plaintiff's counsel requested an adjustment in the amount of $2,288.15 to award prejudgment interest on that amount. 1)The plaintiff was not prepared to accept the lesser amount. The defendant's failure to identify the express terms of the contract stipulating that the price was paid for various goods, services, or both, a reasonable implied term to the effect that the parties agreed to charge, and pay a fair price for those goods and/or services, was not supported by the evidence. 2)The court accepted the plaintiff’s argument that in the absence of an express term in a contract, such as an implied term, an implied price for goods, or services, could not be determined. 3)The amount of travel time and costs were not included in the calculation of the quantum of damages awarded. 4)Costs were to be charged based on a mutual assumption of fact or law, created by statement, conduct, or silence whereby one party has conducted itself (or acted) in reliance on that shared assumption so as to change its legal positions. 5)Even if this evidence had been led, the court would still have reservations in accepting this argument, because the plaintiff is not free to charge whatever it chooses to charge. The amount sought was unreasonable."

The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases. Here the right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence as the Court was able to assess the weight to be given to the officers' evidence.

HELD: The accused was acquitted of all three counts. The Crown had met the necessary burden of proof with respect to the issue of identity and may not rely on the Certificate of Analysis.

e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","This is an appeal by the City of Regina and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 from a decision dated October 10, 2003, of Roger J. LePage, sitting as a Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. HELD: The Court found that the City and CUPE discriminated against the applicant on the basis of his disability.

All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay.

With respect to the evidence of Ms. Brinkman, she does not swear that Ms. Bodkin was selling methamphetamine at the relevant time. 3) With respect to due diligence, it must be noted that the appellant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who represents him before this court. The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward. If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems. 4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered.","The appellant appeals his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","HELD: The court found that the most representative and fairest method of determining this self-employed father’s income was three-year average under the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The court also found that if the respondent had overpaid child maintenance to this date, he may offset the overpayment against future maintenance payments but only to the extent of $50 per month so that the maintenance actually paid will not drop below $518.00 per month until it was extinguished."

The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The chambers judge had the necessary evidence to make his decision whether all, some, or none of the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error nor did he err in law and his conclusion was supported by the evidence before him."
e_2008skpc108.txt,"The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home. They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.","The plaintiffs sued the defendant for $3,604.13, which they alleged represented the losses incurred by the plaintiff as a result of the frustration of the contract. The plaintiff brought a counterclaim against the defendant Pacific Home Products Ltd. for $176.22. The defendant brought a claim against the plaintiff for $2,200.00 in damages. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $96.13. 1) The contract was not reasonably forseeable by either party. The change in the material left over in the failed Ens project was permanent and non-transient. 2) The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in original obligation assumed by them. 3) The plaintiff should bear 65% of the loss and Dennis Ens and Anne Ens 35% of loss. 4) The court found that the plaintiff's reasons for rejecting the installation of the concrete pad and pillar system, different foundation type and design, were reasonable in the circumstances. It was clearly frustrated by the unforseen soil conditions which prevented the drilling of ten foot depth pile holes for concrete piles.  5) A just and reasonable resolution demanded that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration be borne by the parties in a 65/35 ratio. The contract as a whole was totally different from what the parties intended.  6) There was no evidence to show that the plaintiffs mitigated their losses by salvaging $1,000 worth of parts from the Ens sunroom material and further deducted the down payment of $2200."
e_2010skca8.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows: Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent. If any directions should be required in relation to the execution of the order, the parties are given leave to informally apply for such directions through the Registrar's office.","Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under s. 487.051(3) under the Criminal Code.

e_2012skpc43.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to ss. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with operating while his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to s. 255 and 253 of the Code. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The Court found that the accused's driving irregularities and the physical symptoms painted a virtual stereotypic portrait of a motorist impaired by the alcohol. The absence of the smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption of beverage alcohol did not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia considered in their totality. The Court also found that in the face of the manner of driving demonstrated by the accused and the very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer reasonably could have only a mere suspicion that the motorist had alcohol in his body.  1) The Court held that the Court could not have concluded that there was any breach of s. 8 or s. 9 of the Charter and the Certificate of Analysis was therefore admissible. 2) There was nothing in the evidence to suggest the officer wilfully or recklessly disregarded the rights of the accused. 3) The accused was identified with a photo driver's licence which the officer photocopied and was able to make an in court identification. The officer did list a number of indicia which a person reasonably could conclude were the result of impairment by alcohol. Further, the results of breath sample analyses are generally considered reliable and their exclusion would end any prosecution for the offence of driving while over the legal limit. 4) The court held that it was not necessary to exclude the certificate of analysis as there was nothing to suggest there was a wilful or reckless disregard of Charter rights."
e_2012skqb498.txt,"The defendant applied pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 169 for leave to amend his Statement of Defence. This is a defamation action and the amendment would add that the words spoken by the defendant were true and that the alleged defamation was justified in law. The action relates to statements made about the plaintiff's failure to properly read an X-ray and his failure to pass certain certification exams and that health officials knew that he should not be performing the work he was doing. There is another defamation action, described in this judgment as the College Action. The defendant applied pursuant to Rule 41(2) that his action and the College Action be tried together because there are common issues of fact between the two, albeit different actions.  Trying them together would be in the interests of judicial economy and avoid the possibility of conflicting findings. HELD: The Court ordered that the two actions be tried one immediately after the other in the manner determined by the trial judge and that the defendant be given leave to amend his Statement of Defence.","FIAT. The defendant applied pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 41(2) for an order that this action and Tsatsi v. College of Physicians and Surgeons, Don McMorris and The Sunrise Health Region, be tried together. The statements made by the defendant were made by him on June 1, 2009. He alleged that the plaintiff has failed certification exams and that health officials knew the plaintiff should not be doing the work he was doing. The College Action is also a defamation action. HELD: An order pursuant to Rule 41 of the Queen’s Bench Rules was appropriate. 1)The actions were tried one after the other, with the College Action proceeding first, and that the evidence in the college action be evidence in this action. 2)There were common issues of fact between the two actions at issue. There were common allegations of competence and the statements made specific allegations about the plaintiff's failure to properly read an x-ray, and also alleged that, although health officials had known the plaintiff for some time, they knew he was not qualified to do the work they were doing. 3)The College Action was also a defamatory action. It relates to statements made about the competence of the plaintiff as a radiologist which the plaintiff says were published both before and after June 2009. 4)The Court was not satisfied that the draft order provided for trials to be conducted in a manner that best achieves the goals of judicial economy and justice that are the underpinning for joinder of actions. The order in which the trials are conducted, the use of evidence from one action in the other and any other matters that must be addressed are better left for determination by the trial judge."
e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. The Lawless have an English speaking background. They attended a French language school for two years. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children's provisional approval to attend was not extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The family applied for an interlocutory injunction, alleging that the school had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. The court granted provisional permission and granted permanent permission for the children to attend the school. The children commenced this action against the defendant and then applied for interim permission. The Court found that the CÉF had failed to live up to its ten commitments, namely that it would not allow the children in the school to participate in a French immersion program, and that it was in the best interests of the children and their families to allow them to attend a French school in the province."
e_2015skqb345.txt,HELD: The court granted summary judgment for the defendants. It held that it could determine the defendants’ application prior to the plaintiffs’ application for certification. The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages. The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence. There was no genuine issue requiring a trial. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them. It was not necessary to decide the application for certification.,"The original plaintiff issued his claim under The Class Actions Act, SS 2001, C-12.01 on October 8, 2013. This claim was subsequently amended and will refer to the amended paragraph numbers. The claim seeks damages against the defendants, Loblaw Companies Limited and Loblaws Inc. [Loblaws]. The claim concerns the misleading and deceptive advertising of 'Low Sodium' beverages by Loblaws and seeks to recover damages on behalf of those who purchased the defendants' “Low Sodium” beverages but ultimately received beverages which were no lower or not appreciably lower in sodium than other, non-Low Sodium beverages. The defendants have gone to great length to try and confuse the issue, the issue is simple. It is misleading to label identical products differently."
e_2015skqb412.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice. The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","FIAT: The applicant applies pursuant to s. 67 of The Legal Profession Act for an assessment of all bills for legal services that Brabant and Company Law Office [Brabant] rendered to Cowessess within six years of the application. The application proceeded on March 12, 2015. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The information put forward here is much more specific than the request itself and it is not fair. This is as a result of the requested request itself. It is not in the interests of justice to extend the time beyond the 30 day time period provided by ss. 67(1)(a)(i) of the Act which establishes an assessment as a matter of right. 2) There are a number of affidavits from former Chiefs and Council members confirming the quality and effectiveness of the legal services during the time they worked with the applicant. 3) The applicant has not done so, it is in the interest of justice, and it was not in their interests to extend this time beyond 30 days for the assessment of the accounts."
e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The Court granted the respondent interim primary residence and an equal division of family home and property. The Court found the petitioner's Federal Child Support Guidelines income to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support for D.K. in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal and child support of $5,250.00 per month."
