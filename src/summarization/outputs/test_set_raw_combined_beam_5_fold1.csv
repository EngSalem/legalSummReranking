2003skqb487.txt,"At issue was the interim custody of the child and child support. HELD: Interim custody was given to the petitioner with access to the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month. On an interim custody application, the Court must take into account the status quo.","At issue on this application is the interim custody of the child of the petitioner and the respondent. The parties began to cohabit in 1998. In May 1999, the parties would'switch Keanna every second day' and that after that the respondent had access to every second weekend until November 2002 when the petitioner ended access. The respondent made no attempts at gaining custody until he was served with the application of the mother. HELD: The child has and does reside with the petitioner, with access and visitation arrangements to the respondent and various other persons. The petitioner has and has a loving, stable relationship with her mother. Notwithstanding the instances of suspended access, the arrangements for access appear to be in the petitioner's best interests. There is plenty of affidavit evidence to support the conclusion that both parties are loving parents to their child. The mutual love and acceptance demonstrated by the families and relatives of each party is self-evident and commendable. The court will have costs of her application."
2_2012nssc10.txt,"Rule 77.03 – Liability for costsThe court found in favor of the respondents after a half-day chambers hearing. They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim. Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two. This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing. While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs. The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner.","The Bowsers were successful as Respondents in Chambers, seeking a declaration that there were were entitled to right-of-way across the land of the Bowsers and seeking mandatory injunction and permanent injunction as well as damages for the loss of use and enjoyment of their properties. The Sheas, by omitting some important information, undermined the strength of their claim. They applied for costs on a solicitor client basis. Rule 77.01(1)(a) and 77.02(1) of the New Rules make it clear that the winning party in the litigation is presumptively entitled to partial compensation of their expenses of litigation. Customarily this has been viewed as substantial, but not complete, indemnification of the expenses of the litigation. As in many other cases, the dispute concerns to what extent there should be partial compensation. The Bowsers suggest $12,000 plus disbursements, whereas the Sheas suggest $5500. Both parties file Notice of Application in Chambers and faxed Notice of Contest and Affidavit in September. In October, the two parties sent a fax to the Court and requested a declaration. The two parties faxed and then filed hard copies of the affidavits on October 5, 2011 and October 12, 2011. They did not object to the late filing of the second and third affidavits. In their letter to the court, they also requested that the Court consider a multiplier of two for a total of $6000 in costs. HELD: 1) The Court found that the amount sought was $3,000. It was not an appropriate base amount for solicitor client costs. 2) The costs consumed the entire day of chambers and the morning of October 20, 2011 by ending at 10:45 a.m. It would be reasonable to conclude that effectively the hearing consumed days. 3) The court awarded $3000 in costs as appropriate partial compensation toward the bowsers’ costs of litigation and to do justice between the parties. To do justice, the court ordered that the costs be divided equally among the parties as a whole."
9_1990canlii2351.txt,28 year old male with 19 previous theft and property related convictions - broke into a vehicle and stole a computer - damaged motor vehicle  -  18 months for theft and 12 months concurrent for mischief upheld on appeal.,"Appellant, twenty-eight years old, pled guilty to two offences. The theft of a computer and modem exceeding $1,000 in value contrary to s.334(a) of the Criminal Code and mischief by damaging a motor vehicle and damaging the vehicle to gain entry into it, and from which he stole the computer and a modem. 12 months to be served concurrently with the first offence on the theft charge. At issue was whether the sentence should be increased or reduced. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The sentence imposed was unfair. 2)The trial judge was correct in his remarks that general deterrence must be a matter of primary concern. 3)The appellant could not be described as a youthful first offender. His record of criminal convictions began in 1980 and included 19 times theft and property related offences."
2007nspc30.txt,"Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction. The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground. The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib. The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence. Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge. The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant.","The accused was struck in the arm by the defendant's right hand as he walked down the driveway towards the property. The defendant had a shovel in his hand and the accused had a knife. The knife was not in the accused's hand as the defendant had pulled it out of his pants. The altercation continued and the defendant suffered fractures to his elbow and rib cage as result of the assault. The accused and the victim both suffered from fractures to their upper arm. The defence evidence established a prima facie case inasmuch as that evidence establishes that the defendant intentionally struck the victim and thereby granted him his right to enter a premises for the purpose of preventing a trespass. The Court found that the accused, by driving in anger to the property and entering thereon despite being told not to enter upon the property, placed himself in the role of an aggressor. It would have been reasonable for the accused to have believed the defendant to be a trespasser and thereby justified in using no more force than was necessary to prevent the perceived trespass."
b_1996canlii7148.txt,"A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident. The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued. An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found. A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation. The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act. SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview. It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event. HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.  1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs. Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate. The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke. On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate. The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction. Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate. Estoppel was not applicable. Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act. The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages. These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1). They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4). Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle. As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).  3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear. A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.  4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.","A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased car arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff claimed SGI's reimbursement for the $503.73 deducted for depreciation and a'reinstatement clause' which confers upon the insurer the option of making good the loss by reinstatement, but does not provide an additional element to the statutory limits placed on the liability of the insurer. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1)An election to repair was not an election. If the insurer elected to repair, it would be liable for the entire repair, whether it exceeded the limits in statutory condition 8(4) or 8(2). 2)An express election is not necessary. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to have made an election to reinstate. 3)The test, as used in Lepin, concentrates on whether or not the insurer's conduct'misled the insured into thinking that the insurer would reinstate'. In this case, the obligation of insurers to repair is not merely to lay out the insurance money in reinstatement as far as it will go, but to rein reinstate completely. As long as the insured knows that he is entitled to pay the full cost, he has completed his election and can go no further. 4)If an insurer elects to repair or replaces a motor vehicle, it must give the assured unequivocal notice that it intends to do so. 5)The claim against SGI for the loss of principal amount of insurance is dismissed. 6)If SGI elected to fix the vehicle pursuant to s. 39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, it is liable for that amount, 20% for depreciation or 'betterment'."
d_2006skqb251.txt,"Hayley is 7 years old. In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her. The father seeks sole custody. The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years. The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests. The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access.","The father petitions for sole custody of his 7 year old daughter, while each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother independently seek joint custody with the father. Hayley's mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) Hayley is seven years old. Since the commencement of these proceedings, each of the parties and their extended families have chosen to relocate from the City of Moose Jaw. The Court has no other facts before it relating to the physical aspect of where Hayley might reside or go to school if she moves with her father to the city of Calgary.  2) The mother testified that she and her father had agreed that she would be the homemaker for the foreseeable future. It is clear that this child is slower, but the same cannot be said about the opportunity to earn a living in Moose Jaw other than the fact that she is the eldest of the five children at the time of this child's birth. This child is the product of tumultuous relationships between father and daughter. The mother's relationship with her daughter has not been fostered in a meaningful way. The father has had no effective communications with either of the respondents, J. O. or C. H., and information is generally passed through his wife or through his own mother and on to himself. 3) There is no evidence as to how the mother would parent the child should be placed in the custody of the child. It would be unfair and unjust to place the child in the hands of her biological father and require him to assume a more traditional and secondary role in the child's life."
d_2003skqb4.txt,"FIAT. The father applied for an order pursuant to the Children's Law Act s.29(1)(a) finding the mother in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of the August 15, 2002 access order. He sought a fine and an order that she bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. He applied to vary the terms of the access order. The Court raised jurisdiction, service and time issues.HELD: 1)To avoid adjournment counsel consented to the court's jurisdiction, the acknowledgement of service and the abridgement of time. 2)The mother was found to be in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the order by repeatedly refusing, without lawful excuse, to comply with its terms. Almost without exception she refused to make the child available for the bi-weekly supervised access visits. She did not abduct the child. The mother was to purge her contempt by paying the father's solicitor and client costs respecting the two applications fixed at $1,500 and by obeying the access terms of this order. The August 15, 2002 order was vacated. 3)The father was to have unsupervised access on alternate weekends. He may bring the child to Saskatchewan but shall not remove her from this province or Manitoba without the mother's written consent. The father shall bear the costs of access with partial reimbursement in the amount of $60 per month, which may be deducted from ongoing child support. He shall give at least seven days notice if he is unable to exercise access. The mother shall have reasonable telephone access.","FIAT The petitioner father applied for an order pursuant to s. 29(1)(a) of The Children's Law Act finding the respondent in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of an August 2002 access order. She sought to restrict access visits to supervised visits in Manitoba. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt and ordered to pay solicitor and client costs fixed at $1,500 and by obeying the access terms of this order. The limited access proposal of the respondent was not realistic because it virtually guarantees that the petitioner and his parents will never be able to develop any relationship with his son, whom the petitioner has been supporting financially on a voluntary basis since birth. Nor was the access proposal realistic because the respondent did not have the financial ability to bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. Both applications sought costs of $60 per month as a partial reimbursement of those costs.  1) The father was to have access to the child on alternate week-ends from 4:00 p.m. Friday to 7:00 pm Sunday. Access need not be supervised. The mother was to give at least 7 days notice each time he is unable to exercise access. If he fails to do so, he forfeited the next access date. 2) There was no evidence that the respondent deliberately disobeyed the court order by repeatedly refusing without lawful excuse to comply with terms of the order. Almost without exception, she refused to make the child available for the supervised access visits that were ordered to take place every two weeks over a four-month period from August to December 2002. She continued to be held in contempt when she moved with the child without prior notice to the petitioner. She purported to terminate access and refused to return the child for the remainder of the visits that had been ordered. 3) Costs were to be divided equally among the parties."
7_1994canlii4892.txt,"The wife petitioned and the husband counter-petitioned for a division of matrimonial property, custody, access and spousal and child support. HELD: 1)The matrimonial property was valued and divided equally. The wife was permitted to register a caveat to protect the value of her 1/2 interest. If the husband did not arrange payment by September 1st next, the wife was given leave to apply for a sale. 2)The wife was given custody of the 2 children of the marriage.  The court ordered specific access for the husband. 3)The court confirmed the interim support orders made before trial in the amounts of $400.00 per month for the wife, $400.00 per month for the oldest child, and $800.00 per month for the youngest child, who was handicapped.","The issues were custody and access, child and spousal support and division of the matrimonial property. The respondent granted interim maintenance in the amount of $400 per month for the couple's two children; $800 for the respondent and $1,600 for the children. An application by the respondent to reduce the interim support was denied by Matheson, J.on May 11, 1993. It is apt to proceed first with division. The assets and values placed thereon by the parties were $50,711.66. An award for retroactive support and maintenance sought by the petitioner must be rejected. The Saskatchewan Teachers' Superannuation Commission shall transfer the sum of $30,000 to an R.R.S.P. as may be prescribed by the mother. The farm home is 22 miles from the respondent's residence. The petitioner has from this date a beneficial interest created by this order, sufficient to support the registration of a caveat in the first three lands to the extent of $60,000. The value of the farm land is $7,774. One half of that amount may be transferred to the prescribed R. Rothko R.S.(R.P.) for Mrs. Heshka. HELD: 1)The Saskatchewan Teachers Superannuates Pension Benefits were to be divided equally. 2)The respondent was not seeking custody of the children but required firm guidelines as to access. Upon hearing the parties' evidence they were of the view that a kind of specified access should be put in place. There was discussion at the trial as to how it should be determined. The parties agreed to pay the petitioner for her support at $400. The amount payable to the respondent over that of the'realtor' fixed at $42,375. In the meantime the mother may apply to the court for a sale of the lands to facilitate payment of the amount then outstanding.  3)The parties conceded there was to be an equal division. There were no grounds upon which it could be varied downwards as the petitioner contends. The evidence did not allow for lessening of the monthly payment for the fuel that was prepaid at the time of the marriage. 4)The petitioner was entitled to take possession of her cabin belongings pursuant to the terms of the interim order."
2010skqb292.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of organic oats. The contract between the plaintiff and defendant stipulated that the oats were to be delivered at a stipulated moisture content. The defendant accepted the oats from the plaintiff and did not indicate any issue with the moisture content. In turn, the defendant sold the oats to a broker for shipment to Germany. When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation. HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality. The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff. There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff. The resale of the oats to Germany was the defendant's responsibility and the plaintiff is not a party to the contact with the German company. The plaintiff was awarded the balance of the contract price, plus pre-judgment interests and costs.","The plaintiff, certified organic farmer, sold organic oats to the defendant who in turn sold the oats through a broker in Ontario to the ultimate destination being a miller in Germany. The German miller rejected some of the oats as having a high moisture content and refused to pay the farmer. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to full payment of the contractual price.  1) The testimony before the court established that the contract as described above was validly entered into between Wlaswich and Bio Canada. The quality requirements of the contract had been met. 2) There was nothing in the contract with the farmer in which he was to continue to accept risk of non-acceptance or non-payment from any third party. He was an interested party in the whole transaction and no evidence was led that he had sufficient skill with respect to knowledge and use of the German language to allow proper interpretation of the documents. 3) The documents submitted by Bio Canada were not admitted into evidence.  4) The issue of whether the plaintiff fulfilled his contractual obligations to the company and thus entitled to a full payment was of little relevance in the final conclusion.  5) The plaintiff had judgment against the defendant in the sum of $51,608. The plaintiff has claimed pre-judgment interest. There is no legal reason why Bio Canada should not have made payment of all the sum owing to Wlwich. He is entitled to costs on a party-party basis under Schedule I 'B', Column 3 of the Tariff of Costs."

The defendant entered the house in the night and assaulted the complainant when she returned to pick up some clothes. Imposing a sentence of two years eight months, plus a ten year firearm prohibition, that this offence could be categorized as a major sexual assault. The principles of sentencing and the impact on the victim, especially in view of the fact that she was his common-law spouse, made this sentence fit.","The accused was convicted of sexually assaulting his common-law spouse. The offence was contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. A jury had found the accused guilty of sexual assault on the wife, whom they had separated days prior. The accused had previously entered the home of a stranger and raped her, despite her struggles to get out of it. She had recently filed a victim impact statement and indicated that she did not wish to return to her father's home. HELD: A fit and proper sentence for the crime, taking into account the circumstances of the offence and the requirements of denunciation and deterrence, was a period of incarceration of 2 years and 8 months, the total being 30 months. Under s.100(1), the criminal Code, the accused was prohibited from possessing or possessing firearms for a duration of ten years.  1)It is of particular concern to the Court that, given the frequency with which these cases are appearing in the courts, that there is a risk of becoming desensitized to the horror and trauma sexual assault inflicts upon the victim and the fear that radiates to society generally from reports of such crimes. 2)The Court must take care not to underestimate the gravity of this offence. It carries a possible maximum sentence of 10 years."
d_2013skca22.txt,"The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable. The prospective appellant failed to establish that there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings or to the field of practice, the state of law or the administration of justice to warrant a determination by the Court.","The appellant seeks leave to appeal an order by the Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an Administrative Judge appointed pursuant to the Court Administration Protocol (CAP) established as part of the settlement of the Indian Residential Schools litigation. The parties are disputing MLG's obligations under the CAP and each has made an application to the Administrative Judge for directions for directions. The appellant argues the CAP was a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process meets its overall objective of determining if the amount of MLG's fee is reasonable and equitable. The Administrative Judge made no error in requiring the applicant to supply the redacted electronic billing records as whole from the 'live data' for the residential schools litigation. Both parties relied on hearsay evidence and an application for directions is simply an informal procedural step to ensure the Verification process moves along. Any allegations of delay by the appellant are simply unfounded and in applying the test for the granting of leave, the Court of Appeal will look at the reasons for the impugned order. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. There is no issue of importance to the proceedings before the Court or to the field of practice or the administration of justice generally as to why an appeal will delay and add to the cost of proceedings. An appeal will unduly delay the proceedings and will unnecessarily add a piece of the puzzle. MLG has failed to demonstrate that there is a need for one comprehensive database for the purpose of verifying the applicants' claims. The administrative judge exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring MLG to pay the alleged accounts of ESI for MLG without sufficient information and without due process. There was no error by failing to require Deloitte to complete its report and order the report delivered to MLG. The applicant has made all reasonable efforts to comply with the February 8, 2012 order by providing additional information in a format which could not be reconciled with the original information. MLG is now using a different supplier for its internal billing. All legal fees payable under s13.08 will be paid no later than 60 days after the Implementation Date."

Dismissing the appeal, that the sentencing judge considered all the appropriate principles in imposing sentence. He did not commit any error.","The appellant pled guilty to a charge of fraud exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. She immediately accepted responsibility for her actions, cooperated with the authorities and pled guilty at the earliest opportunity. No explanation, other than one consistent with greed and envy, was ever given for the commission of the offence. Only about $17,000 was recovered from bank account of the appellant.

7_2004nsca118.txt,"The father, who was in arrears under an order requiring him to pay child support, applied to vary the support order which had been made less than a year before. He failed to make the required financial disclosure and relied on a medical disability of which he gave no prior notice. The judge allowed the application to proceed, over the objections of the mother, and reduced the child support obligation to $1 per month. The mother appealed. Appeal allowed; the judge's decision to allow the application to proceed was procedurally unfair to the appellant and wrong in principle. Only in rare circumstances should a party applying to reduce child support be heard absent that party making full disclosure.","The mother appealed an order which, in response to an application by the father to vary a child maintenance order, reduced his child maintenance obligation to $1.00 per month. The father had never paid any child support voluntarily under the orders and was in default of the disclosure provision in Justice MacLellan's order. He also sought to rely on a medical disability of which he had given no previous notice. HELD: Appeal allowed in part; the reasons for the decision were not clearly wrong but the absence of disclosure here was unfair to the mother as it prevented her from making full response to the father's application. The court appeared concerned that court staff had scheduled the application without the proper documentation being in the file and that Mr. Francis, as self represented litigant, should not suffer an unfair standard of oversight."
c_1997canlii11098.txt,FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to s. 159(3) of the Land Titles Act to continue caveats until further court order or until withdrawn. The respondent had served notice to lapse all of the caveats which were based on an agreement taken by Freeholders Oil from the registered owner of the minerals. The respondent sought an order directing the caveats be continued on the condition Home Oil commence an action within a reasonable time to determine their validity. At issue was whether the caveator or the challenger should be required to initiate an action. HELD: The caveats were to be continued until a further court order was filed in the Land Titles Office or until they were withdrawn. 1) Each of the agreements was prima facie still in existence as there had been no cancellation or rescission of the agreements and Home Oil was the valid successor of the interest of Freeholders. 2) Further documentation would be required by a trial judge to determine the issue of the validity of Home Oil's interest in the leases including whether Home Oil's lease violated the rule against perpetuities.  3) Home Oil was given its costs of the application.,"FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to s. 159(3) of the Land Titles Act that the caveats set out in itsoriginating notice shall continue until further order of the Court, or until withdrawn. The respondent was seeking to lapse the caveats and served notices to lapse on the applicant. Each of the caveats is based on an agreement taken by Freeholders Oil Company from the registered owner of the minerals. HELD: The application to continue the caveats was dismissed with costs to the applicant and the respondent in the amount of $1,000.00.  1)It was not conceded in this case that there was an agreement for sale in existence and the reasoning in the three decisions referred to is not applicable. Further documentation would be required by a trial judge in determining the issue of thevalidity of Home's interest in the leases involved, including the matter of whether Home's lease violates the rule against perpetuities. 2)The Caveator did not have an interest and Home was the successor in interest to the subject agreements, exhibiting at the same time all the certificates of title, the caveats, and all of the leases underlying the caveats. There had been no termination of any of the agreements by consent by the caveator. 3)The applicant had failed to produce all necessary documents. It would be inappropriate to require the applicant herein to establish the agreement when it is the applicant's position that there is no agreement, and it would be most difficult for the applicant to establish negative. 4)A summary proceedings of this nature have long been regarded as inappropriate to final determinations of complex issues of fact or law touching upon the rights of caveators and land owners. The facts did not allow for such a determination. There may be any number of circumstances in applications under s.159 where established agreements are not in issue, whereby the onus of commencing proceedings may fall upon the party which filed the caveat rather than the party challenging same.

9_1999canlii2477.txt,"The appellants motion to strike the respondent's statement of claim was dismissed on the ground that questions of law are not matters to be brought before the court on an application to strike. The Chambers judge also accepted the respondent's submission that the extent of the immunity of administrative boards and their members from actions such as this based on their alleged malice and bad faith is, as yet, unclear in Canada. Allowing the appeal in part, that the Chambers judge erred when he concluded that all questions of law, including questions where the law is clear, should not be brought before the court in an application to strike, when he concluded that the constitutional question posed by the respondent had not yet been answered by the courts, and when he determined that the extent of the immunity of the appellant Board and its members, except for the Chair, was unclear. The appeal was allowed with respect to the action against the Board and the individual members, apart from the Chair.","The appellant applied a wrong principle of law in refusing to strike out the respondent's statement of claim pursuant to a motion brought under Civil Procedure Rule 14.25. The broader issue involves consideration of the immunity of the Labour Relations Board and its members, from actions based on their alleged malice and bad faith. The appellant states that the actions of the Board, and of the personal defendants who participated in the decisions leading to these actions, were an attempt to stonewall the plaintiff from uncovering and making public that the principal of the plaintiff and that he was alleged to have an anti-union attitude. The appellants subsequently brought an application for certiorari to the Supreme Court to quash the Board's orders and its decision to refuse leave to apply for reconsideration. The Chambers judge dismissed the application for leave to appeal. Dismissing the appeal, that the issue of Crown immunity as disclosing no reasonable cause of action, was not a matter of multifarious proceedings, at least not to the extent of being frivolous and vexatious, and all appear to the court to be sincerely designed to seek redress of alleged wrongs."
c_2000canlii19597.txt,"The accused was charged with uttering threats to his 77 year old mother to cause death to her and his brothers contrary to s.264.1 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The words spoken by the accused were clearly meant to be taken seriously and implied menace to the listeners. The accused's evidence was disbelieved. His constructed story did not 'hang together'.  2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences. Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility. The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had been familiar with the workings of the criminal justice system which was not a negative inference.","The accused was charged with knowingly uttering a threat to cause death to his three children contrary to s. 264.1 of the Criminal Code. The accused had lived on a farm for 64 years and had two other children. One of the children had recently passed away and a bitter family fight had developed over dealings with and entitlement to his rather substantial estate. When the accused dropped in to visit his grandmother, the grandmother, who was preparing to go bowling, heard the accused say that he would blow up the farm and its occupants in plastic bags. The defence objected, arguing that the convictions were dated and highly prejudicial. The Court allowed the application based on s. 12 of the Canada Evidence Act and the case law. It is always open to the accused to make a Corbett application and have ruling on it before electing to call evidence. In a non-jury trial, there is little point in raising the application as the evidence will have to be put before the trier of fact in order to get ruling on the motion anyway. The Accused is presently in the contracting business. He has been married for 19 years and has an adult daughter and grandchild. He appears to have built up a modest net worth. HELD: The Court held that there was no need for the defence to formally admit the accused's convictions or give them any probative value whatever. At whatever point the issue of the Accused's record is raised, the duty of the judge sitting alone is to indicate that he is instructing himself that he must not treat the record as tending to show that the accused has propensity to commit crimes, or that he has a criminal disposition. While none of the convictions are for an offence that would normally be prejudicial to the Crown's credibility, the Court referred to them in the Corbett decision as being of sufficient importance to keep the jury from hearing potentially-judicial evidence until its admissibility is determined."
9_1994canlii7210.txt,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","The defendants were charged with permitting a private building or facility, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of s197 of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village.  They claimed the bylaws of the resort Village were inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s15 of the Charter. HELD: The charges were dismissed. 1) The municipality did not deny the existence of a boathouse on a public reserve and it did not seek permission from anyone. 2) The Department took the position that the expense of maintaining the reserves was the responsibility of the municipality, despite the fact that the Province was the titleholder. 3) The Municipality stepped into that position. Moreover, it could be argued that after the enactment of the interim zoning bylaw in 1986, permission from the province had to be obtained if their zoning bylaws did apply, in law, to public reserves. In any event, having the municipality settle the matter would have come at the price of the continued existence of an ostensible violation of the nature reserve and the Government's rights as landowner."
b_1995canlii6134.txt,"The Plaintiff commenced these proceedings seeking to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiff's condition related to 2 pre-existing injuries. The only issue which the Court was asked to resolve was whether this accident had caused or contributed to the Plaintiff's injuries. HELD: The question posed was answered in the affirmative. While a normal healthy person might not have been injured in this low speed rear-end collision, the Court was satisfied that, because of the Plaintiff's previous injuries and poor sitting position, the collision did contribute to her current condition in a modest manner.","The 46-year-old female plaintiff sought judgment for damages she suffered as a result of the defendant's negligent operation of the motor vehicle owned by Mr. Bird. All of the elements of the plaintiff's claim had been resolved with the exception as to whether her injuries were caused by the defendants negligence. HELD: The Court held that it did not have a medical doctor nor had it any significant training in the area of anatomy or neurology, nor was it qualified to diagnose injuries. Further, it held that the injuries were not caused by any of the defendants' negligence. The Court sought to resolve the issue of causation by having the court answer the following questions: 1) did the collision cause or contribute to any ofthe plaintiff's injuries or damage; and 2) did not rely upon the opinion of the medical doctor who was not qualified to give an opinion as to causation of the pain."
5_2014skpc78.txt,"Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son. The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband. The parties were separated. The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child. After this RCMP were contacted. On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained. During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it. They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach. Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography. The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO. The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above. However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”. When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home. She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house. She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle. During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures. He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs. Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant. Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included. The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her. The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction. The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources. The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model. The purpose of including the information was not made clear. The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore. The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused. Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him. The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?  HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and invitation to sexual touching contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The Court found that the Information To Obtain Search (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 10(b) of the Charter and that evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege the commission of the offence of sexual assault, or creation of child pornography, but rather that it was a search for items that might support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially. The trial proceeded with voir dire, conducted at the application of the Defence, to determine the validity of the search conducted pursuant to the warrant. The Crown did not appear to be presenting evidence that might be expected to cover all aspects of the arrest and giving of the rights to counsel under s10(b)(warrant to search), although there was a possibility that some of the evidence obtained could be relevant to the issue. HELD: The search of the computer immediately without further authorization and/or without providing their return to the justice as set out in the final lines of warrant render the search illegal.  1) The Court was unable to take judicial notice of the capabilities of cellular phones generally, and guess whether this particular one would be within the broad description of a device capable of storing images or other relevant data. It was never suggested that relevant material was found on this cellular telephone. 2) It is of significant importance that the Court consider the applicability of the ITO to the wider issue of sexual offences in the context of the trial to determine whether the Court can reasonably conclude that the information obtained is sufficiently defective to warrant that it is invalid. 3) There was no evidence obtained by the accused that the search was done without the knowledge of counsel or that the accused was committing the alleged offence or that evidence of that crime would be found in the specified location.  4) It was of significance that given the detail of the items to be searched for, the omission of cellular telephones was intended, and the search of such items was not an unreasonable step in an investigation. The information contained therein could have been obtained by reason of the alleged denial of rights, which is of significance in considering an appropriate remedy if a breach is established.  5) The court was able to conclude that there was sufficient evidence presented by the attending officer to warrant the search. The court could not conclude that this evidence could not be reasonably inferred from the evidence gathered that led to the decision to issue the warrant"
b_2003skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son. The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application. However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered. The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will. The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.  1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business. The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools. The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss. The 'disappointed beneficiary' principle was applicable in this case.","A chartered life underwriter and financial consultant purchased an annuity life policy through Nordstrom for $60,000. It was his father's intention to name him as beneficiary of the fund but his plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. One of the estate assets was the Trimark mutual fund which Mayer had purchased in 1997 for $68,501.10. Garry Mayer claimed that the mutual fund ought never to have formed part of his dad's estate. Each party gave notice of intention to cross-examine on the affidavits. HELD: Garry Mayer has cause of action as disappointed beneficiary and that he suffered damages as a result of Nordstrom's negligence. The plaintiff shall have pre-judgment interest from the date of death of Mayer to his date of this judgment and his costs to be taxed. The claim against Nordstrom is dismissed. 1) Although Nordstrom gave the caution he claims he did, his completion of the beneficiary designation on the application form could do nothing but cause confusion in the plaintiff's mind. That entry, for all intents and purposes, resulted in an investment and designation almost identical to the one made by Mayer in 1993. 2) Although the disappointed beneficiary principle has usually arisen and may well usually arise in the context of solicitors and will preparation, this 'disappointed beneficiary' principle is not function merely of the defendant's occupation. In Esser v. Brown, 2003 BCSC 246 (CanLII), 223 D.L.R. (4th) 560, the British Columbia Court of Appeal saw as analogous to the role of the solicitor, that of notary public who ought reasonably to have contemplated that carelessness would cause harm to a third party. This is not the case here. 3) The plaintiff's knowledge of Mayer's intent, his failure to advance products that would meet that intent, and his reliance on Mayer fathoming that beneficiary designation made was void in law, all evidence of a failure of a professional to discharge his duty of care to him and consequently, his negligence. As it was represented concurrently with Nordstrom, there shall be no order as to costs for or against it."
b_2002skqb72.txt,"Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278. He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time. The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies. He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit. The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time. Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans. The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans. At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001. HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines. Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a). The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees. The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs. The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay. Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month. The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.  3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance. The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2). A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald. It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. 4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due. If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750.","The parties sought to vary the existing child support order. They have two children, aged 21 and 18. Under the terms of the order, the respondent was paying child support in the amount of $987 per month on the basis of an income of $80,278. The second child, aged 18, decided not to go to university that fall and the respondent ceased paying support for him. HELD: In the circumstances at hand, it would be appropriate to calculate arrears only for the support of the two children under the age of majority as they are involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and had the ability to contribute adequately to their food, shelter and related expenses when not in attendance at school.  1) The Table amount of support for children based upon the respondent's income is $1,153 per month. This amount is not so high as toceed the generous ambit within which reasonable disagreement is possible. It is not clearly excessive given the cost of maintaining the home for the children. 2) The Court was satisfied that in the circumstance at hand and the demonstrated ability of the children to obtain reasonably remunerative summertime employment that they are not dependent upon their parents during the summer months and have the ability contribute adequately with their food and shelter expenses when they are without school attendance.  3) The respondent was awarded $611 per month as child support due for one child based upon his income. He had paid no child support since June 1999. The Court of Appeal declined to find the chamber judge in error."
d_2010skqb349.txt,"The defendant applied for an order sealing the affidavits of two young people who were the victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted at a high school by senior students, including the plaintiffs. The defendant argued that public disclosure of the affidavits would exacerbate the harm that was done to the young people. The Leader-Post was granted leave to speak to the matter and opposed the application. HELD: Bearing in mind the efficacy of the high school grapevine, particularly in an electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of the young persons in their affidavits will not cause further harm to them. The public, including fellow students, have the right to know their version of the facts. However, other portions of the affidavits that refer to the effects of the assault on the young men and their ramifications to others should be sealed because there is a real risk of further harm to the young persons and to others.","The defendant applies for an order sealing the affidavits of two young persons. Counsel for the plaintiffs consent to the order. The defendant applies at the top of the range of protections which the Court may afford to individuals in our society and that the onus is on the applicant to establish on a continuing basis that this remedy is required. The affidavits speak to the effects of the assault on the young persons and ramifications to others. The evidence of Don Hoium, Director of Education and former educational psychologist, brings home the point that if the evidence of the Children were to be made public, it may provoke harassment and acts of retaliation against the Children and their families, possibly by other students. The Court is concerned that such disclosure would put both the physical and psychological well-being of the Students and Their Families at further risk. HELD: 1) The Court refers to Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] S.C.C.; and R. v. Mentuck, 2001 SCC 76. As everyone knows, Parliament prohibits publication of the identity of young person by ss. 110 and 111 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.D. 2002, c. 1. 2) There is no order as to costs which were not put in issue."
c_1998canlii14016.txt,"The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment and have the plaintiff's claim struck out. The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence. The defendants, carrying on business as a hauling sub-contractor to Tri-Link, reported a cheque drawn on the plaintiff bank as lost. Tri-Link issued a replacement cheque. The first cheque was certified at a bank branch of the plaintiff in Alberta and deposited to the defendants' credit union account. Default judgments were obtained in January/March 1997 against the defendants who now sought to have them set aside pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 346 and 173(a). The defendants claimed the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action as a certified cheque is irrevocable and as such any default judgment may be set aside ex debito justitiae, in which case delay in bringing the application is not factor. The plaintiff claims it has a cause of action in either conversion or mistake of fact/unjust enrichment. HELD: The defendants' motion was dismissed as the plaintiff's statement of claim adequately disclosed a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment.  1)There are exceptions to the irrevocable nature of a certified cheque. The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of a certified cheque as payment did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants in this instance had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. The cerified cheque did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants had already received payment for their services.  2)In recognizing exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certification the commercial utility of certification at the request of the payee is maintained while providing recourse to a bank where a payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of a certified cheque.","The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment entered by the plaintiff against them and have the plaintiff's claim struck out. The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence. The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of certified cheque as payment did not satisfy just debt. The defendant in this instance had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. The plaintiff sought judgment against the defendants in the amount of $18,442.39 plus interest. Default judgment was taken out January 13, 1997. In considering an application under Rule 173(a) the court may only look at the notice of motion, the attached statement of claim, and any document which is referred to in the statementof claim upon which the plaintiff must rely for the establishment of the claim. The court must assume that all the allegations in the defendant's statement of claims are true, and so assume, determine if such allegations are sufficient to disclose a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment. Here the defendants relied upon the principles in drawee bank v. Simms (1942) that establishes that where a bank honours a cheque notwithstanding a valid countermand and the effect is to satisfy just a debt, the bank may successfully defend an action by its customer/drawer for reimbursement."

d_2006skqb35.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.","The plaintiffs brought a number of chamber applications. They sought an order compelling the defendant to respond to written interrogatories; an order permitting further oral examination for discovery of the plaintiff on issues arising from his responses to written questions; and an order directing him to provide a copy of the report of neurologist Dr. Vrbancic to counsel for the plaintiffs. In addition to pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages, the plaintiffs alleged negligence or breach of duty by the defendant in performing laparoscopic gynecological surgery. The defendant argued quality assurance reviews where complications occurred are all subsequent to the events of this case and irrelevant. In any event, the plaintiff has already been extensively examined relating to his training, experience, techniques and procedures.HELD: The applications were adjourned sine die.  1)It was the position of the plaintiffs that a review of the defendant's skills, technique, judgment and competency would be appropriate, but only to the extent that they relate to breaches of duty or standard of care in performing the surgery on the plaintiff, Lisa Dawson.  2)The court was satisfied that special circumstances existed permitting further examination of the defendants. Wide latitude was permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge would be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the plaintiff."
e_2008skqb192.txt,"FIAT: A previous interim order detailed specific access in the period leading up to pre-trial or trial, however more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial. The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order. HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.  The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children. The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order.","FIAT: The access issue has come before the Court twice. In February, 2007, Ryan-Froslie J. issued a fiat that specified custody and access. For the period subsequent to that, she ordered that the petitioner have access every weekend (other than the weekend he exercises regular access), and every third weekend from Friday at 4:00 p.m. to Tuesday at 10:00 a.m., (b) Access to the Children during May 28, 2008 to June 4, 2008. The increase in access is reasonable on an interim basis. However, it does not address the fact that he would be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that, during this period, his contact with the children should be increased. The fiat did not address access for the Christmas, 2007 period or the 2008 summer holiday period."
c_2014skqb31.txt,"Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it. The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants. SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance. The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation. The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs. Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured. The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success. The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material. The improper material included information on settlement discussions.","FIAT: The real issue in this application is whether Saskatchewan Mutual Insurance Company (SMI) was in a special relationship of insurer with the plaintiffs that carried a duty of good faith and fair dealing. The plaintiffs are policy holders of SMI's policy of insurance. This policy is not an issue in the action commenced by the plaintiffs and is not relied on for coverage in respect of the claim. HELD: 1) The application to strike the claim against SMI is based on the fact that the plaintiffs policy holders are included in the defendant's coverage. 2) The Court found that a breach of the plaintiff's duty to act fairly and in good faith does not give rise to a separate cause of action. Rather, it is an avenue for the development of a duty in tort, if Vorvis makes necessary. 3) Each act by SMI was done by a person or persons therein alleged on behalf of themselves and their co-conspirators in furtherance of the said conspiracy to defraud. There was no allegation of an increased loss as a result of this claim."
9_2016skpc123.txt,"HELD: The Charter application was granted. The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights had been breached. After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view. The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence. Regarding the impaired driving charge, the accused was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with breach of s. 8 of the Charter by failing to provide a sample of her breath to enable analysis to be made by means of an approved screening device. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on all counts. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge’s conclusions that the police officer was attending to conduct a search for evidence following Evans, 1996 CanLII 248. The police officer exceeded the authority conferred by the implied licence to knock. The essential elements of this charge were found beyond reasonable doubt. The evidence of impairment established beyond a reasonable doubt any degree of impairment ranging from slight to great the offence had been made out. There was no evidence of driving at all. The officer told the accused that she was investigating an impaired driving complaint and she had to go to the residence to obtain a sample. The accused opened the door and while the two remained on either side of the door, she knocked on the door. The occupant answered. The Crown did not really argue the impaired driving charge and there was little if any evidence to support the charge. Therefore count two found the accused not guilty. The court relied on a Grant analysis. Grant 2009 SCC 32 (CanLII) requires the court to consider and balance the effect of admitting into the trial process the unconstitutionally obtained evidence on the one hand against society”s confidence in the long term criminal justice system. Here the accused was in her own home and the unreasonable search contrary to ss. 8 affected her privacy, liberty, and human dignity. She did not ask the officer in and as I have said all evidence should be excluded from the time of the breach. The implied invitation to knock extends no further than is required to permit 'convenient communication with the occupant of the dwelling'. The refusal to provide samples is also considered."

HELD: 1) The Court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether to grant an application for severance.  In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to Walbaum's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four separate trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.  2) The plaintiffs acknowledge that only relatively small portion of trial time (perhaps less than 1 day) will pertain to the claims against any one of the Sims, Gabriel or Dumurs. It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them. Specific dates and times should be set aside for the plaintiff to call evidence with respect to its claims against each applicant group. The applicants should be relieved from attending the trial at any other time.","FIAT. Nine defendants brought separate motions pursuant to Queen’s Bench Rule 41(a) for severance of the claims against them or for orders staying the claims until the plaintiffs’ claims against the Walbaum Group had been decided. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants had diverted virtually all of its assets to himself, his companies (All-Rite Plumbing, and Tamwal Investments) and his wife, Tammy Walbaum. The defendants’ evidence against all of the defendants can be adduced in no more than two and one-half days, given the number and complexity of their claims. Specific days to be designated by counsel for the plaintiffs may pertain to the evidence to be called against one, two or all three of the applicants. HELD: 1) The plaintiffs were not precluded from adducing evidence related to the Walbarge Group”s dealings with each other or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walba Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense. 2) The plaintiff was awarded general and special damages for pecuniary losses of approximately $20,000. 3) The defendants were relieved from attending the trial on any date not designated by them or designated by the trial judge for preparing a defence or presenting argument. 4) Costs were in the cause."
b_1995canlii5809.txt,"FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee. The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer. The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction. The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination. The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'. The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay. HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable. If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness. 3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise. The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness. 4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule. The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct. 5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing.","FIAT. An application for judicial review of an arbitration award by a three-person panel dated December 1, 1994 which reinstated the respondent as an employee. The panel found that based on the respondent's agreement and the evidence presented at the hearing, the Arbitration Board was obliged to uphold the termination. The respondent took issue with the fact the Board refused to apply the doctrine of culminating incident and conclude that on the basis of the respondent grievor's employment record, the final incident justified termination of his employment. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1)The standard of judicial review applicable to disputes arising under a mutual agreement is the patently unreasonable test, absent jurisdictional or procedural fairness issues. The parole evidence rule precludes the receipt of verbal evidence offered for the purpose of adding to, varying or qualifying in any manner the terms of the written document. 2)The wording of clause 10 of the mutual agreement does not admit of such an argument. 3)There is no basis for the admissibility of an oral statement of intention on this account. 4)The application was allowed in part on the ground that the Board was not prepared to accept that the August 14, 1993 incident amounted to a culminating incident. The penalty imposed was a suspension without pay for 16 months."

August 7, 2007. The provisions of the order addressed the applicant's child and spousal support obligations. It was based upon the petitioner's then income of $48,196 and the respondent's $0. The parties agreed that, from and after his mandatory retirement, his circumstances including the substantial decrease in his income from the current level of approximately $67,000, may well constitute a material change in circumstance prompting yet another variation application at that time. HELD: The application was dismissed. The applicant was directed to immediately proceed to complete the application to split the CPP credits equally, the same to be supported by the respondent once her CPP claim was ruled upon.  1)The respondent recommenced his military career in early 2000 and served in the military at the time he authorized the Order he now seeks to vary. This is based upon Ms. Ellis-Reid's failure to obtain employment of any significance since the Order and her failure to diligently make and pursue an application for CPP disability benefits for which she may be eligible as required by the Order.  2)The applicant had no income and she suffered from at least two of the now longer list of medically disabling conditions set out in her affidavit.

6_1991canlii4510.txt,"This was an application by the plaintiff vendors for a declaration that an objection to title raised by the defendant purchasers was without merit. For the plaintiffs, that the Vendors and Purchasers Act can be used to establish possessory title, and the plaintiffs had succeeded in demonstrating 'open, notorious and continuous possession' of the property for over 40 years. The possibility of a claim by the Crown under the Escheats Act was ruled so remote as to be frivolous.","The vendors and their predecessors in title, namely the Bentley heirs, by open, notorious and continuous possession since 1946, a period in excess of 44 years, have established a good and marketable possessory title to the lot in question. The evidence submitted by the purchasers/defendants was that of 20 or 21 missing feet to which the Crown must lay claim in order to defeat the present possessory ownership. No evidence was adduced to contradict the allegations made in the Vendors and Purchasers Act or that of the Crown, which may have been a practise under the Escheats Act. The issue here was whether the time period between 1961 and the present does not establish the 40 year period of such possession required by the Limitation of Actions Act. HELD: The application was granted. 1)Even if found, by the required proof of possession for more than 40 years, the Crown would not defeat a claim by the Crown under the Economic Schemeats Act against whom such possession must be proved for a period of at least 60 years. 2)If the evidence showed that the vendors/plaintiffs had been in possession since at least 1946 when the 15' strip was transferred from the Bentley daughters to the Bentleys and then continued to make regular and frequent visits, the missing frontage would only be 21' on that lot. 3)The affidavit evidence did not support the Crown's claim that the lands in question were vacant at the time they were acquired. 4)Although the appellant's claim for possession was dismissed, the court found that even if it came to pass, there would not be 40 years of evidence of possession sufficient to defeat a Crown claim of ownership under the Limitations of Actions."
d_2006skpc95.txt,"The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.","The accused was convicted of aggravated assault for wounding his sister. The Crown applied pursuant to s. 753(1) of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. The defence position was that the accused should be designated a long-term offender. HELD: The Court held that the Court must now consider whether the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt that the offender is 'dangerous offender' and must be sentenced to indeterminate detention. The Court sought to review the applicable law at the outset, given that there were significant amendments to Part XXIV of the Code in 1997 which have been interpreted by both the Supreme Court of Canada and the Court of Appeal, and given the unusual nature of this sentencing procedure. These cases all involved trial court decisions which pre-dated Johnson. The standard is not whether cure is guaranteed but whether there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control in the community. There must be more than an expression of hope that the person can be treated, but we must not require an absolute guarantee of treatability."
2_2009skqb516.txt,"In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals. In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR). Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH). The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH. The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts. The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies. HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for. The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.  2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue. It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH. The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA). While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act. The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings. The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer. The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer. The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered. They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.","PricewaterhouseCoopers, receiver and manager of Wheatland Industries (1990) Ltd. (the plaintiff) carried on business as a farm equipment dealer at separate locations in Rosetown, Saskatchewan and Elrose, Saskatchewan. The plaintiff entered dealership agreements with equipment suppliers, including New Holland Canada, Ltée, Case Canada Corporation and Flexi-Coil Ltd. The three suppliers granted Wheatland lines of credit on the security of present and after-acquired product inventory. In 2003, the three suppliers became part of CNH Canada Ltd.(CNH Canada). In 2004, both parties commenced action against each other claiming that the right to require the other to restock direct ship parts from parts shipped by the plaintiff was terminated. In 2006, the plaintiff applied to terminate the appointment of PwC and to appoint as receiver in respect of all of the assets, undertakings and properties pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) and s. 64(8) of the Personal Property Security Act. HELD: 1) disputes arose between the parties as to the priority of the CNH security over the TD security as to credits to Wheatland arising from the return of parts inventory. 2) The contractual provisions clearly entitle CNH to refuse to restOCK direct ship Parts. 3) In the context in which Wheatland was in default in its obligations to TD, this is a collateral matter which has no impact on the outcome except as to costs. See Andersen (Arthur) Inc. v. Merit Energy Ltd., 2002 SKCA 105 (CanLII), 227 Sask. R. 44. The receiver, as an officer of the Court, is acting on behalf of all creditors to determine priority between competing claimants. That is not the same as the Receiver seeking to change the priorities as between the respective claimants. Parts and service manuals returned by the receiver to CNH are to be read and construed as part of the agreement. The purpose of the priority agreement is to allow the debtor to recover the value of his or her lost or used goods (the inventory and credits supplied by the supplier from the supplier to the receiver on the understanding that the part was not returnable by the dealer. 4) There is no evidence that any of the items in issue have been'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 48 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. 5) The word 'goods' must be interpreted to include 'parts' which in common English language usage would surely be the case."

In 1997, the plaintiffs first learned through other family members that the defendant, a nephew of the deceased, had revealed to them that it was actually he who was the driver of the car at the time of the accident. They brought an action under the provisions of the Fatal Injuries Act. This was an application to disallow the limitation defence raised by Judgment Recovery on behalf of the defendant. Dismissing the application without costs, that the limitation as prescribed by the Act is twelve months, which the plaintiffs had clearly exceeded. This time period is without regard to the injured party's knowledge of whether or not a claim exists.","This was an application for an order disallowing the limitation defence raised by Judgment Recovery on behalf of the defendant, Howard LeLacheur, pursuant to s. 10 of the Fatal Injuries Act. The plaintiffs were living in Alberta at the time of the 1972 motor vehicle accident and alleged that the defendant had been the driver when the accident took place. The action was commenced 25 years later. At issue was whether the limitation period should begin to run until February 1997, the date upon which the plaintiffs learned for the first time that Howard was the driver of the vehicle 25 years earlier. HELD: The application to disallow the defence was dismissed. The Court declined to award costs to Judgment Recovery. 1)The plaintiff had made no inquiries to the defendant or the police as to how the accident happened. She could have asked him her father's name several times but for some reason did not do so. When time runs from the 'accrual of the cause of action' or from some other event which can be construed as occurring only when the injured party has knowledge of the injuries sustained, the Judge-made discoverability rule may not extend the period the Legislature has prescribed. 2)There had not been a sufficient evidentiary basis upon which this Court could make a finding of fraudulent concealment on the part of the plaintiff. 3)There was no evidence before the Court as to the time period for the discovery or interrogatories or any other sort of pre-trial procedure involving the defendant."
c_1998canlii13533.txt,"FIAT. An application to vary maintenance for two children under the Federal Child Supprt Guidelines. At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d). The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields. He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October. He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work. The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated. HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month. 1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income. The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997. Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past. No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years. The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded. In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable. The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck. The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children. His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine. 2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school in Manitoba, why the expense was necessary in relation to the child's best interest and whether the child had any means to contribute. Leave was given to return the matter to the Court with the appropriate supporting materials.  3)No order as to costs.","FIAT. An application to vary maintenance under the Child Support Guidelines in respect of two children. The father had been employed for 5 years as a computer consulting firm and had recently acquired equipment and claimed capital cost allowance in lieu of renting equipment. HELD: The application was refused with leave to return the issue to Court with appropriate supporting materials. 1)The most reliable indicator of true income is the 1998 year because of the significantly higher amount he earned at the mine. She argued that income should be determined by projecting his income at straight wages until October 15, 1998 thereby giving recognition to the possibility of lay-off and the reduction in overtime. The farm income will be adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowances for this year. 2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school there, why the expense isnecessary in relation to the child's best interests or whether the child has any means to contribute to the expense. The mother had set out a reasonable basis for disallowing certain expenses. The claims for gas and repairs are significantly higher than in previous years and no explanation is offered. The capitalpayments for land and machinery, and the costs of the step-child's pet should properly be excluded. 3)Costs of the two children's s.19(1)(g) income were refused as the respondent's income was $347 per child."
c_2013skpc94.txt,"A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children's mother was deceased and their father indicated that he was unable to meet his children's needs. The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children. They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated. The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access. The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister. HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b). The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change. The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister. The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father.","The agency initially applied for a long term order under s.37(3) of the Child and Family Services Act (the Act) but then amended its application to now apply for an order that the current foster parents be declared as persons having a sufficient interest in all three children (under s. 23 of the Act and s. 37(1)(b)) and an order granting them custody. Should the amended application be granted? HELD: Each child in need of protection pursuant to s.11(b) is ordered to be placed in the custody of the person of sufficient interest, which effectively means they can return to their parent, placed with a person of adequate interest, in the event circumstances change. The Agency will make the orders requested.  1)Each child is identified by initials for the purposes of protecting their identity. 2)It is important that the children continue to have a sense of security in their placement and continuity in their lives. It would be beneficial for each of the children to remain together as a family unit to the extent possible. The revised plan is appropriate in these circumstances."
4_2005skqb265.txt,"The respondent applies to vary his 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for him. In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month. The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive. HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.  1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court. In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2) The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met. If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3) By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him. The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her. There was no justification for the payment to continue. It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her.","FIAT: The respondent applies to vary his February 28, 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 1, 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for August 2004. The issue of whether these orders should be made retroactive was reserved. HELD: 1) The Court has jurisdiction to vary support orders pursuant to the Divorce Act. In L.S. v. E.P., the Court held that the circumstances leading to the child support award had not changed. The parties' incomes were similar to what they had been in 1992 and the children continued to spend a substantial portion of their time with their mother. 2) Retroactive support is not the same as ongoing support in that the period of time to which it applies has passed and the resources needed for its payment may no longer be available. The Alberta Court of Appeal disagreed with many of the factors on this issue. It adopted the reasoning in Henry v. Henry, 2004 CanLII 34381 (ON C.A.), which held that there is a presumption in favour of retroactive support (i.e. that it is reasonable and consistent with the obligations of child support that payor be required to pay) and that the Court is always free to intervene and determine the appropriate level of support for children."
2_2010skqb444.txt,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence. On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marihuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act as am. He applied for an order excluding evidence of cocaine found in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter of Rights were violated. This decision follows a voir dire held to determine the admissibility of the evidence. HELD: The evidence must be excluded. 1) The accused was unusually nervous. He asserted that he was looking for any additional labels, paint colour changes or information that might confirm or refute the vehicle's true owner and identity. 2) The evidence was found in the manner of a motor home. The interior of the motor home was extensively modified to facilitate the transportation of illegal drugs. The plumbing and holding tank systems had been disabled, walls had been moved and secret compartments created, and hydraulics with switching system had been installed to provide access to the compartments. The motor home did not cross the centre line and was not speeding. The accused responded that he understood and stated that he wanted to speak to a lawyer. 3) There was no evidence that the accused had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched. The evidence is excluded from the determination of this issue."

He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA. MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy. The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary. They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $26,864.46 plus costs, to be taxed. 1)The evidence that travel was dangerous and put the plaintiff's life in jeopardy was accepted. Therefore the plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for the surgery. 2)The exclusionary clause did not exempt MSI from liability for payment. The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation under the policy to extend the benefits in question.

HELD: The plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for surgery as a condition pre-existing the effective date of the policy.  1)The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation to pay. 2)The evidence of the two qualified physicians who treated Hurd for pneumothorax and sent him on his way to Chicago to continue his studies was not shown. Neither doctor detected or made mention that they even suspected bleb as the underlying cause of his condition. If, as Hurd now alleges, he was excluded from coverage because of the August experience, attach no significance to what he now says. 3)The fact that Hurd required medical attention and surgery in Chicago for a condition undetected earlier by qualified medical personnel was not a sufficient condition to bring the plaintiff within the operation of the exclusionary clause. There was no evidence that travel was dangerous and put Hurd's life in jeopardy. 4)The plaintiff will have judgment for the sum of $26,864.46 prayed for in this action together with costs to be taxed."

HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittals ordered by the trial judge were restored. There was no basis to overturn the findings of fact made by the trial judge.

The charges against both accused relate to willfully evading the payment of taxes and the unlawfully making of a false or deceptive statement in the return of income. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The appeal judge misinterpreted the decision of the trial judge. He proceeded on the worst case scenario, that all payments received by the appellants constituted income and then he considered the issue of criminal intent. Thus, he considered income before dealing with mens rea. 2) The accounting records upon which the claim for deductions were made were, in fact, false, false thus obviating the liability for tax. The Crown did not raise this issue in its grounds of appeal. 3) The Crown argued the accounting records and record keeping were part of an elaborate scheme of deception to avoid taxes. The trial judge stated it was also consistent with simple sloppiness. 4) There is some question as to whether either accused willfully evaded the payments of taxes, or whether there was any intent to make a statement knowing it to be false and deceptive.

2008skqb287.txt,"The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case. The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.","The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the Minister's care until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the request for long term orders for the three children. HELD: 1) The children were apprehended from their mother S.D. (the'mother'). The mother took the position that the children are not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to ss. 11 of the Act and that they should be immediately returned to her care. 2) The Minister called 18 witnesses including two experts and one mother to testify on the relevant factual matters. It is not disputed that S.T. breached the condition of the PSA allowing only supervised time with the children, but the mother was not happy to have the Ministry involved and never has been. The father of one child, who was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder, indicated that he was unable to attend trial because he was ill and did not wish to be part of the proceedings. The Mother testified that she did not have the strength or accuracy to self-inflict the injury on her face. 3) The mother had commenced a relationship with a man by the name of J.M. who had been violent with the mother. She underwent surgery for cleft lip and palate, had severe hearing loss and had bone conduction hearing aids which she wore as a headband. She has changed. 4) The evidence in this matter focused on the mother's change from being a mother to a person who took full responsibility for the care of the children."

He did not defend the civil proceedings and the Plaintiff applied to have her damages assessed. The evidence in the civil trial also disclosed that the Plaintiff had be sexually assaulted by her uncle. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff. 1)The Plaintiff had been diagnosed as suffering from severe psychological problems as a result of the sexual assaults. 2)The Court assessed the Plaintiff's non-pecuniary damages at $50,000.00 and apportioned 80% of this sum or $40,000.00 to the step-father. 3)The Plaintiff was also awarded $25,000.00 in punitive damages as against the stepfather.","The defendant, the step-father of the plaintiff, pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of sexually assaulting her. He was sentenced to ten months imprisonment, subsequently reduced on appeal to six months. The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant claiming damages as a result of the sexual assaults. The defendant did not defend the action.HELD: 1)To the extent that damage awards in sexual assault cases represent non-pecuniary damages, the quantification thereof should accord with the principles articulated in J. A. Andrews. In Myers v. Haroldson, the court found that many awards did not reflect any appreciable degree of comprehension of the extent of the damage incurred by the complainant. However, evidence was adduced that trauma was also caused by the sexual assault or assaults by her uncle. 2)Because the plaintiff's loss was already assessed as severe and there was likelihood that it may be chronic, she was entitled to an award toward the upper limit of the established range. 3)The emphasis of the award was clearly to punish the defendant rather than compensate the plaintiff for her suffering. The greater portion of damage inflicted on the plaintiff was attributable solely to her psychological trauma and emotional distress. She would continue to suffer to the same extent for an appreciable period of time in future."
c_2007skpc41.txt,"The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then. The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification? HELD: The accused is not guilty. 1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2) The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time. Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later. At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief. Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer. As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 89(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The alleged driving occurred when the accused was involved in a motor vehicle accident and engaged in other alleged misconduct, including driving without due care and consideration for others, and failing to identify himself to the other driver before departing from the scene. HELD: 1) It is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver’s license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. 2) The issue in these proceedings for this accused is what is the mens rea or criminal intent that must be established by the Crown. In the meantime, it was unfortunate the updated status of the suspension had not been conveyed by SGI in the normal course, any earlier that it actually was. 3) It was therefore necessary to assess the credibility of the witnesses who testified in the context of whether the evidence is sufficient for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt the accused had committed the offence as alleged. The accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty."
7_1999canlii3285.txt,"The plaintiff was injured as a result of a motor vehicle accident. The defendant was found liable. At issue was the claim of the plaintiff against the defendant's insurer for Section B benefits. The defendant paid benefits for 129 weeks. It claimed that the plaintiff misrepresented her employment status at the time of the accident, and that the benefits should be re-paid. The plaintiff argued in response that the defendant was estopped from claiming repayment. Ordering the benefits be re-paid, that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation, on the basis of representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff, to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it. It would be illogical to prevent the defendant from getting its money back when it is found that the benefits were paid on the basis of faulty information provided by the plaintiff. This is not a situation in which estoppel lies against the defendant.","The common law wife of the insured was injured when her car was hit from behind by the defendant's vehicle. The insurance company claimed the plaintiff had not shown that she was employed at the time of the accident. The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant and its insurer, pursuant to Schedule 'B' of the Paris insurance policy, for loss of income. She brought this action on the basis that the defendant had refused to repay the insurance company's monies paid to her for the duration of her disability. The defendant argued that the plaintiff failed to indicate any interest in claiming repayment of the benefits until after the commencement of the litigation, thereby causing the plaintiff toalter her position to her detriment by continuing to accept the money. The initial claim made to the plaintiff was for housekeeping. She admitted that she only worked part-time, but claimed that she had worked there for nine weeks. The insurable earnings report for the plaintiff did not show that she worked for any six months out of the preceding 12 months and so did not fall within the deeming provisions. The second claim, for the benefit of those who were paying the plaintiff for the nine weeks before payments were cut off, was not supported by the plaintiff's employment record. There was insufficient evidence before the court to decide whether the plaintiff should have accepted the money or not."
d_2004nsfc13.txt,"The mother was unable to care for the child and the father, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was only entitled to supervised access. Both the paternal and maternal grandmothers presented plans of care to the court, with the paternal grandmother seeking custody and the maternal grandmother seeking care and control of the child. The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother. The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody. The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them.","The mother, who lives with the maternal grandmother, plans to have the child placed in the permanent care and custody of the paternal grandmother, who will be responsible for the child's nutrition and physical well-being. The father, V.M., is a convicted child abuser whose name appears on the Child Abuse Register, having been sentenced to thirty-nine months in prison as a result of his conviction. His access to his son is by court order, supervised only, but there was evidence he had the care of his own son in an unsupervised situation. The mother is 66 years old and lives with her sister. The parties agree that the child is in need of protective services. Although number of her children have been in regular conflict with the law, the mother has always exercised proper parenting skills. Both parents do not have the ability to successfully parent the child without there being sufficient risks to their healthy development. This does not, however, preclude consideration of future bonding if there is enough contact. The paternal grandmother indicated that she would have to move to a larger residence if she got custody."
3_1999canlii2586.txt,"One of the residual legatees of the respondent estate filed a petition under s. 31(1) of the Probate Act. At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.' The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act. The executor appealed. He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding. This was also one of those rare occasions where solicitor and client costs on the appeal were warranted, as the executor's actions amounted to a serious dereliction of duty which the Court termed reprehensible and unconscionable.","The appellant appealed the May 31, 1999 probate decision dismissing his application to have costs to be awarded on solicitor and client basis. The appellant had practised law for in excess of 40 years before retirement and had made a number of specific bequests, including a bequest of $50,000 to her niece and a $10,000 gift to the Zion Lutheran Church. Dorothy Crouse, widow of the appellant appointed the appellant, sole executor of her estate, in September 1995. She died in September 1997. At her request, the Acting Registrar of Probate ordered all estate money be paid into an estate bank account.

d_2013skpc206.txt,"HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance.","The plaintiff puts forward that he loaned $5,000 to the defendants, with an additional $1,000 being paid to the plaintiff. The defendants are new to Canada and to large extent reliant upon John and his family for their employment and housing, it would not be out of the ordinary for the plaintiff to provide them with a gift to start their new life in Canada. Although the cheques come from the corporate plaintiff, the corporation is controlled by John. The plaintiff states that he gave the money to the defendant as a gift. The defendant testified that they sent out a demand letter close to the time of issuing the Statement of Claim, but there was no request to pay it back earlier. There is no record of it, as far as loan documentation goes, and no evidence to support that the refund of these monies was not by agreement by the defendant. HELD: 1) The amount of damages is not known at this time and as the defendant may be able to now qualify and receive funds retroactively for the special benefits from Service Canada, the issue of damages as to this aspect of the defendant's claim is adjourned to a date to be determined by the parties and the Court. It may be that there are no damages incurred by defendant Lilia if she now qualifies for payment from service Canada. If she is not able to obtain the payments that she had lost, the Court will hear evidence and argument on the quantum of damages to be paid by the plaintiff Lilia.  2) Lilia claims back $2,400 which was paid for the repayment of expenses related to her bringing her daughter to Canada. She also claims that $960.00 from the defendant is to pay back.  3) The payback of the loan as set out in the statement of claim at $500 per month was never taken from the plaintiff's wages, which one would anticipate considering the plaintiff is a corporation. It would be simple matter for the corporation to have asked for and received loan documentation if in fact they were loaning money to us. There of course is no need for documentation if it is simply gift to assist the defendants with their start-up in Canada."" Lilia's counterclaim is not proven and there is no evidence that the plaintiff signed the cheque and gave it back. 4) The defendant claims for wages for December 2011.

4_2004skqb280.txt,"This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a). The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","FIAT: This is an application pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act (I-10.03) by Ms. [V.G.B.] for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: 1) The parties never lived together but had an intimate relationship which resulted in the birth of a child. 2) The child support order was set at a rate higher than the Table amount based on undue hardship. The onus is on the applicant to establish that any continued unemployment is unintentional or, if intentional, that it is reasonable in the circumstances and does not warrant the imputation of income.  3) Section expenses are often referred to as “add ons” to Table support. These expenses cover items that are not normally covered in regular child support orders. Some s. expenses such as those relating to extracurricular activities must be “extraordinary” for the court to determine income. The only issue is whether the Court can impute income to him pursuant to s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines on the basis he is intentionally under-employed or unemployed. The evidence does not support a finding of intentional unemployment. The parties’ financial situation do not warrant such a finding. 4) The Court reviewed the circumstances of the child and found that the child’s current income was below the amount normally required for Table support and that her standard of living was less than that of the other child. 5) The parents’ children had other children and other children from two different mothers. Mr. E.H. had been unemployed since May 2003. The father had been pursuing secondary education and was engaged in that pursuit at the time the child was born. Given his health, his education, skills and physical limitations, he had been actively working towards obtaining a position with the provincial government. Should the province turn down his proposal, the father would have to seek employment elsewhere in the province. The court found that this would create a situation where the child would not be able to earn income. In this case the father was unemployed for a further period of 3 months. This should provide a reasonable period of time for the child to recover from his medical problems and begin fulfilling his obligation to his daughter.  6) Section arrears in the amount of $1,000 to $2,000 were met by the date of this application. The application involves a two-stage analysis. The applicant must establish that circumstances exist which would cause undue hardship and establish that"
b_2010skqb311.txt,"The accused was charged with having aftermarket tint on the side windows of his vehicle. He appealed on other grounds. The summary conviction appeal judge raised the issue of the sufficiency of the charge on its own motion. The face of the ticket purported to charge the accused with an offence under s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations. HELD: The charge was declared a nullity because it was drafted so poorly that it did not give fair notice to the accused of the charge or the penalty to be imposed if breach was established. Section 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations purports to make displaying aftermarket tint an offence, but the section is a charging offence and does not prescribe a penalty. The correct way to charge an accused with this offence is under s. 113 of The Traffic Safety Act which makes it an offence to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations. The count could not be amended to cure the defect because the charge was a nullity and void ab initio. The conviction was quashed.","The appellant appealed his conviction and sentence following his conviction in Traffic Safety Court for 'unlawfully have sunscreen in front side windows' contrary to's. 66(3) The Vehicle Equipment Regulations'. The Crown tendered evidence of previous convictions for the same type of offence with the same vehicle and asked the court to impose a fine of $200. The traffic justice found the appellant guilty as charged. The appellant did not exercise the voluntary payment option and instead sent an agent to appear on his behalf on the March 10, 2008, return date at which time a 'not guilty' plea was entered and the matter was set down for trial. No one appeared for the appellant on that date. The Crown was given leave to proceed ex parte and trial was held. The peace officer testified that the appellant was operating his vehicle with after-market tinted windows on a public highway. The police conducted a breath sample after demand was made and the officer issued a certificate of offence. The officer did not appear on time and the charge was met with a not guilty plea. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction quashed. 1)The count cannot be amended so as to breathe life into something that is nullity. 2)The standard of review is correctness and the appellate court should intervene if the decision is not correct in law. 3)A conviction based upon defective information ought not be found to be nullity because the information contained in the documents does not contain the words 'without reasonable excuse'. There is nothing in the Regulations that prescribe that contravening the prohibition constitutes an offence with corresponding penalty. Only if a charge is so badly drawn up as to fail even to give the accused notice of the charge will it fail the minimum test required by s. 510(2)(c) of the Code. 4)The Court was given an opportunity to file a written argument on the sufficiency issue. It would appear that it could be possible to frame a count so that allege an offence of operating a vehicle that has after market tinted side windows because, as here, the accused did not advance the charge as framed being a nullity, thus giving him the possibility of a full defence and fair trial."
b_2012skqb350.txt,"The applicant wife sought an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered.

The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax. Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000. The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value. The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application. The evidence introduced at the hearing of the wife's position in pre-trial calculations clearly indicated that she expected the discount for tax on RRSPs. Therefore, the Court ordered that the judgment be satisfied by way of rollover of RRSPs in the amount of $111,600.","FIAT: The issue is the interpretation of a consent judgment based on negotiated family property settlement. Present counsel for the husband is new to the file, and was not the lawyer involved in the settlement. The wife seeks an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. HELD: 1) The consent judgment is to be interpreted in the same manner as an agreement. Negotiations are not relevant. The court must examine the context in which the order was issued, evaluate the order in accordance with the circumstances, and question whether the acts or omissions could reasonably have been contemplated to fall under the terms of the order. 2) The wife's outline of the family property and debts provides the necessary context for an appreciation of the discussions that followed, and it is therefore necessary to outline the calculations in some detail. 3) The husband argues that the trial judge erred in failing to discount the value of funds held as RRSPs to adjust for tax implications. He argues that RRSP assets should be significantly discounted to reduced after tax value as at the date of division. To entertain the husband's proposition would be to construe the judgment in an unnatural sense."

The respondent had entered into a contract with Fraser-Brace for the construction of a hospital and required the insurer to obtain fire insurance. Without acknowledging liability, the respondent had been required to contribute under the terms of the policy issued to the insurer. The appellant sought to recover its money with interest from Hartford on the basis that it was not responsible. The trial judge found the policy had been issued under the mistaken belief by the insurer that the building was never at the insured's risk; that the policy was never void and that Guardian wasn't liable. He ordered the respondent to repay the advances with compound interest. Several issues were raised on appeal. The appeal on the main issue ought to be dismissed. There was no evidence nor even suggestion that Delta caused the fire nor that there was any obligation to pay the fire loss. As Delta did not cause the fire, it had no liability to the Province or its insurer for the allocation of fire risk to Delta by the contract with the Province. Allowing the appeal and ordering the taxation of the respondent's costs, that in this case the respondent was not required to respond as the insurer and there was no contractual relationship between the parties and the insurer, nor between Guardian and Hartford, which could give rise to any obligation on the appellant's part to contribute."

A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road. The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance. The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC. He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine. The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches. HELD: The evidence is excluded. The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance. The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime. When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question. The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement. The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation. The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get. The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van. The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law. The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van. The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event. The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.","The accused was charged with unlawfully traffic in a narcotic pursuant to s. 4(1) of the Narcotic Control Act and with unlawfully cultivating marijuana in a vehicle. A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of marijuana plants seized as a result of a warrantless search. The police officer observed the accused operating a rental van with Ontario licence plates stop on a grid road leading to a tourist information booth. As he approached the vehicle, the officer noticed that one of the pockets of the accused's jeans appeared to be bulging and he asked if he could empty his pockets. The accused said he was looking for a place to relieve himself. At this point the police officer indicated that there were no officers working in the detachment at the time. The driver of the vehicle testified that he went to get a camera and then proceeded to try and open the black box. He was not able to open it as it was padlocked. HELD: The accused was detained arbitrarily pursuant to common law principles as part of the Crown's case against self-incrimination and the residual right to silence under s. 7. It is to be determined by examining two questions. Was the accused detained prior to the question 'what is in the back of the van?' when did the initial search commence? Counsel argues that once it has been established there have been detention, police officer must provide the accused with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel without delay. There must be exigent circumstances exist in that it was necessary to conduct a search before the accused drove away with the evidence.  1) The Court held that the accused had been detained arbitrarily whether the detention commenced when the constable stopped him on the street, when he requested him to empty his lungs, or when he put him in the rear of the cruiser. The Crown stipulated that the arrest was not based on an unreasonable search. 2) Counsel argues the present case is on all fours with Mellenthin, supra. The Supreme Court of Canada recognized that the random stop of motor vehicle amounts to an arbitrary detention and it is further argued the court recognized that there is an atmosphere of police authority and compulsion when a motorist is stopped by police officer. The present situation did not involve roadside check stop. The Court acknowledged that the Crown acknowledged there was no argument advanced that Cst. McLaughlin was exercising authority under the Gaming Regulation Act but it is reasonable and probable that he was exercising that authority in a non-adversarial setting not involving the exercise of the police crime prevention function."
8_1999canlii12618.txt,"Plaintiff applied for an order pursuant to s.55 of the AAIA requiring SGI to pay to the plaintiff the amount awarded to her in an earlier judgment. The defendant has applied for an order setting aside the judgment and striking out the plaintiff's claim. A car-pedestrian accident occurred causing personal injury to the plaintiff. The defendant was convicted of dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. The plaintiff sued for battery and assault. The defendant was noted for default on this claim and the damages were assessed at $37,717.35, $10,000 of which were punitive. The plaintiff submits that s.102 of the Act should not deprive a citizen of the right to sue a defendant for injuries caused by assault, battery, fraud, or similar torts. HELD: The plaintiff has no cause for action by virtue of her injuries having been caused by an automobile. The plaintiff was precluded by s.102 of the Act from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. Although s.102 of the Act prohibits certain types of law suits, the act provides victims with compensation for injury. No order as to costs.","The plaintiff applied for an order pursuant to s.55 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act requiring Saskatchewan Government Insurance to pay to the plaintiff the amount awarded to her in a 1998 judgment. The plaintiff had been pinned between an automobile operated by the defendant and a stationary motor vehicle, thereby causing personal injury. She applied for summary judgment, but was required to proceed to a hearing to assess her damages. HELD: There must be a declaration that the plaintiff was precluded, by s.102 of the Act, from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. There will be no order as to costs. Herbert v. Misuga (1994), 116 Sask. R. 292 (C.A.) involved claim against the defendant motor vehicle driver for damages for assault and battery. The question to be resolved was whether s. 143 of the then The Vehicles Act, 1983, repealed by The Vehicle Administration Act, S.S. 1986, c. V-2.1 applied. In order to accept the submission, it would have been necessary to conclude that the vehicle was not being used as a motor vehicle when it struck the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal could not reach that conclusion and stated that the limitation period in s.143(1)(a) of the Vehicles Act applied. The action was scheduled to proceed without prejudice to SGI's assertion that its claim of the damages was barred by statute."

b_2013skpc213.txt,HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of both charges. The Court believed the testimony of the complainant.,"The accused was charged with committing sexual assault and for sexual purposes touching a person under the age of 16 directly with part of his body contrary to s. 151 of the Criminal Code. The complainant testified that she did not get along with the accused prior to the assault and that she no longer felt the same way about him. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. The Court found that the credibility of the witnesses was the most significant issue and an application of the instructions in R. v. W.D. (2010 SKCA 24) must be undertaken. 1) It is entirely possible for the jury to disbelieve the evidence of the accused yet, in light of all of the evidence, conclude that they have reasonable doubt. 2) The evidence of K.S. as to what transpired in her bedroom during the early hours of March 1 was clear and consistent. 3) The Court was the trier of fact and law so am obliged to decide the facts in this case by applying the same principles that a jury would be required to apply in such circumstances."
3_2001skqb332.txt,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act. Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.",The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act. The provisions of the Act provide for an implicit scheme of delegation of authority to be exercised by someone specifically designated by the Minister pursuant to the regulations. The Act does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. There was no error by the trial judge in finding that the returns purportedly filed were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. The appellants had filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents filed. The notice simply required a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is of no moment.
b_1997canlii10986.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs applied for an order striking out the statement of defence and counterclaim and separate statement of Helen Rilkoff as not disclosing a reasonable defence or cause of action. The plaintiffs claimed the doctrine of res judicata applied to the claim for damages by virtue of two Small Claims court judgments in 1989 and 1992. The defendants asserted their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was different than those previously dealt with. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The fact that the plaintiffs filed a 55 page brief in support of their submissions and the defendants filed a 14 page brief in response evidenced that the issues were not easily resolved and certainly not on a summary basis.  2)An application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justifiable dispute is revealed. If no facts are in dispute, the parties may resort to Rule 188. Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve the questions of law.","FIAT The plaintiffs applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173 striking out the statements of defence and counter-claim of Jeffrey and Karen Rilkoff and the separate statement of defence of Helen. The plaintiffs claim their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was a different cause than those dealt with in the 1989 and 1992 judgments. The defendants have referred to judgment of this Court in support of their allegation that if the resolutions authorizing the assessments do not include a resolution authorizing the plaintiffs to recover interest and solicitor/client costs, the plaintiffs are not entitled to do so. They also alleged that the issues raised in paragraphs 6 and of the defence incorporated into a paragraph 10 of the defendants' statement were frivolous, vexatious and otherwise an abuse of the process of the court. HELD: The application of the plaintiffs was bedismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause.  1)The preconditions for hearing applications pursuant to Rule 188 are quite different to those relating to Rule 173 in that an application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justiciable dispute is revealed. Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to QBR Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve what appeared to be rather serious questions of law. 2)The Court was not permitted to embark upon the resolution of legal questions in order to determine whether the pleadings should be struck as requested. 3)The application was bedistedissed without costs to defendants in the event of acause."
c_2007skqb224.txt,"FIAT: The accused applicant brings an application for a change in venue in this matter pursuant to s. 599(1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: 1). The application for a change of venue is denied. 2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue. There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports. However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application. In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue. However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found. Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre. It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered.","FIAT: The applicant brought an application for a change of venue in this matter pursuant to s.599(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused seeks an order granting a trial in the City of Prince Albert or such other judicial centre as the Court deems appropriate. The Crown counsel opposed the application. HELD: 1)A reasonably serene environment for trial is still possible in Saskatoon despite the fact that there is an age-old tenet that the trial should take place in the location where the offence occurred. The majority of media reports are over a year old. There is no evidence that the media reports have created a frightened or enraged community such as was the case in Charest. 2)A properly instructed jury will be able to deal with the issues in the trial impartially and in accordance with the evidence presented, such that the accused will receive a fair trial."
3_1994canlii3972.txt,"After an argument with his girlfriend, the appellant drove his car at high speed with the lights off, running two stop signs. At the second intersection he collided with another vehicle, causing serious injury to three people. He pleaded guilty to three counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm; the Crown proposed an intermittent sentence, but the judge sentenced him to nine months incarceration concurrent on each count plus two years probation with conditions. The appellant appealed on the grounds the judge failed to consider the Crown's recommendation, failed to sufficiently state his reasons, and the sentence was excessive. Dismissing the appeal, that the sentencing power of a judge is not limited by Crown submissions, that the failure to state every reason does not constitute and error, and that in view of the appellant's record and other factors, the sentence was not excessive to the point of constituting a reversible error.","The 19 year old appellant pled guilty in Provincial Court to three charges of dangerous driving causing bodily harm. He sought leave to appeal and appeals from his sentence of nine months incarceration plus two years probation on each charge, to be served concurrently. The three charges were all dismissed as reasons for the appeal. The appellant showed recklessness and disregard for the safety of others to a very high degree. The only mitigating circumstance was the absence of alcohol or drugs. He had 11 therapy sessions designed to assist his impulse control and inappropriate anger. The Crown did not oppose sentence in the intermittent range. The appeal was dismissed."
6_2006nsca89.txt,"Six years after the action was commenced, the plaintiff applied to add the defendant's Section D insurer in order to add a cause of action against an unidentified driver. The limitation period for suing under Section D had expired and no notice of the application had been given to the insurer. The chambers judge held that he had no discretion to grant the amendment and dismissed the application. The plaintiff appealed. Appeal allowed; the plaintiff is entitled to renew the application for the amendment in Supreme Court chambers on notice to the proposed, as well as the existing, defendant within sixty days of today's date; if not filed within that time, the application to add the insurer will be deemed to have been abandoned. The court had a discretion to grant the amendment even though the case did not fall within any of the specific situations set out in Rule 15.02 as the broad power to amend conferred by Rule 15 is not limited to the specific instances set out the Rule. Although there was no firm rule that notice to a proposed defendant was necessary in all such applications, generally the applicant should give notice to the proposed defendant (as well as the existing parties) where it is apparent from the circumstances that the proposed defendant likely has a reasonable basis to oppose being joined, such as being prejudiced in its defence by the plaintiff's long delay in asserting his claim.","The appellant sues the Halifax Regional Municipality for negligence. Years later, he decided he should amend his action to add a new claim against a new defendant. By then, the new claim was barred by a limitation period. He applied in Supreme Court chambers for permission to make the amendment. The chambers judge held that he did not have authority under Rules 15.01 and 15.02 to grant leave to the appellant to amend his statement of claim to add Lombard as a party and to assert the Section cause of action against it. The appellant applied to renew the application. The issue was whether the judge should have granted the amendment because this case did not fall into any of the specific powers to amend in the Civil Procedure Rules. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the application to set aside was allowed. The decision on whether the amendment should be granted was not appealed. The matter was left to the Supreme Court to decide. 1)Limidity of the Rules in relation to limitation periods has limited the Court's discretion to grant an amendment. A limitation period has intervened and an important consideration relates to whether the appellant's delay has prejudiced the defendant's defence. 2)Rule 5.04(2)(b) permits the Court to order any party who ought to have been joined to be added. This involved making a claim against an insurer which, in turn, involved a Section of the municipality's insurance policy. 3)The limitation period is an interlocutory issue and the issue involves the correct interpretation of the rules. In this case, the issue was not whether the expiry of the limitation period trumps the power to grant the amendment, but whether it is just to grant it. 4)The Court was not able to say that it would be unfair not to give notice."

The Queen's Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test that set out in R. v. Schmidt. HELD: The proper disposition is to set aside the judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence. 1)On reading the entire oral judgment the court concluded that the judge was saying in effect that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place. 2)The trial judge was incorrect in finding that under s.213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid.,"The appellant was acquitted after trial in the Provincial Court of communicating with another person for the purpose of engaging in prostitution contrary to s. 213(1)(c) of the Code. However, on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench a new trial was ordered, and this appeal arose. HELD: The Court of Appeal declined to admit a nonsuit. 1)The Chief of the Provincial Police interpreted her oral reasons to include a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. 2)The fact that the conversation did not reach the point where the matter of payment was discussed would not preclude a jury from reasonably concluding that an act of prostitution involving the payment of payments for sexual favours was contemplated. 3)The entire reasons must be read to understand the true ratio of 1:1.Reasons for the denial of the nonsuit are given."
4_2011skpc13.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care or control. The Court dismissed the charge of care or control over .08 after a non-suit application. During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying. During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech. In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.  The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence. HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document. The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out. While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence. This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1).","The accused, charged with impaired driving, applied to the Court pursuant to s. 24(1) and s. 2 of the Charter for a variety of remedies, including a stay of the impaired driving charge, an order for a mistrial on that count, a direction that the Crown be allowed to further cross-examine Crown witnesses and an order excluding evidence. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence as a result of a lack of full disclosure.HELD: The Court found that the officer did not make any notation in his notes or in his General Occurrence Report about his observations of the accused and, in the context of how and when the failure in disclosure came to light in this case, the trial was unfair in a way that it was not satisfied can be remedied through an adjournment and disclosure order. On a balance of probabilities the accused's rights under s. 7 were infringed. The second disclosure concern, related to the undisclosed bottom portion of the Checksheet, stands in different light. In this trial, the officer didn't know the full content of the Operational Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document, Cst. Pshyk. Had he known of the reference to slurred speech in that original document, under the heading Observations on Subject, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to made mention that the appellant's speech was slurred."
9_2013skca110.txt,"HELD: The Court addressed the issue of jurisdiction by holding that it would follow its usual practice to refuse to hear an entirely new matter argued for the first time on appeal. Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act. The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested. The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act. However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances.",The applicant appealed the decision of the Chambers judge dismissing his application under Rule 173(e) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to strike out or stay the application of the Director of Community Operations for a community safety order under The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act because the Director's application constituted a multiplicity of proceedings and was therefore an abuse of process.

The order was made to diminish the disparity between the income and lifestyles of the parties. The application for interim distribution of property was dismissed. The court found that this was not a situation where the net assets exceeded the amount of the distribution claimed.

HELD: 1) The court has authority to order an interim dividend pursuant to s. 26(2) of The Family Property Act, SS 1997. In this instance there is some dispute between the parties as to whether they have any beneficial interest in the house they were residing in at the date of separation (which appears to be legally owned by a third party). They concede that this issue cannot be resolved on an interim motion. 2) The husband does not take issue with the wife's entitlement to interim support but states that she has failed to demonstrate need for support. Specifically, he points out that her sworn financial statement shows a modest surplus, which is enhanced by additional evidence that 94% of the cost of her medical expenses is covered. The husband also argues that he is not able to afford support. Interim Spousal Support: $2,000 per month to equalize the gross incomes of the parties is ordered.  3) At an interim stage, the net assets for distribution exceed the amount requested. In addition, ultimately the distribution may have to be by way of spousa rollover from the locked-in retirement funds as there appear to be no liquid assets available to the husband."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)There was clearly no basis for adding the value of the grain on hand to the income of the respondent. There was no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondent and the grain was to be viewed as part of his gross income in the year in which it was sold. 2)There was no reversible error by the chamber judge in accepting the respondent's agreement to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the usual costs on double Column V. The appellant's income is largely the product of the operation of a relatively small farm, augmented by some outside earnings. The trial judge accepted the respondent's income by adding the value of unsold grain on hand and 100 percent of myCapital cost allowance. What, if any, portion of the capital cost allowances should be added to establish available income must be based on the facts of each case and we see no reversible error in the acceptance of this figure by the Chamber judge in this instance."

As well as hundreds of other claimants who had been asked by the management pre-trial judge to regard the plaintiff's action as a test case, the fears of procedural unfairness expressed by counsel for the Attorney General if the issues were severed are groundless.

9_1992canlii2588.txt,", The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault. Allowing the appeal, that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity. The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward. The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.","This was an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. Appeal allowed, verdict of acquittal set aside, conviction entered on the charge of assault causing bodily harm. The Court was of the view that intoxication falling short of insanity or automatism is not defence to crimes of general intent. The defence of voluntary drunkenness has no application in general intent offences. The evidence of his wife shows that the respondent had the presence of mind to recognize that she was naked and to suggest to her that she get clothes on in case somebody came by.HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence imposed was not warranted in law. The court was satisfied that the defence of intoxication was available to the respondent who was so extremely intoxicated that he should not be presumed to have intended the consequences of his act of assault if his state of awareness was akin to that of state of automatism."
e_1992canlii2523.txt,"The appellant contended the trial judge erred in sentencing him to four years for an armed robbery charge, one year on a weapons charge to be served consecutively and a 10 year prohibition order because there were extenuating circumstances which should have resulted in a reduction in sentence. Dismissing the appeals, that the trial judge made no errors in his considerations. The sentences were consistent with the range the Appeal Court had approved in numerous judgments.","This was an appeal against the sentences imposed by the trial judge. Although the appellant pled guilty to each of the two offences, there were extenuating circumstances in his favour that should have detracted from his conviction, there was nothing that the court could do about that. The appellant was represented by counsel. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment for the armed robbery and 1 year for the weapons offence, to be served consecutively. For the reasons given, the Court dismissed the appeal."
8_2010skca149.txt,"The father appealed from the decision of the Chamber's judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment. The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below. The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant. For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances. No error was made on this issue. The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz. The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting. She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests. There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them. The Chamber's judge was entitled to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the children. There is no material error or misapprehension of the evidence.","The father appeals from the decision of the Chambers judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment dated March 30, 2005 governing custody and access to the parties' children. The application before the chambers judge also included child maintenance issues but the father does not appeal that part of the decision. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Chambers judge was entitled to consider only the impact of the change in circumstances when making her determination, by failing to apply the principle of maximum contact, by applying a presumption of the status quo and by finding that evidence as to the wishes of the children was irrelevant. 2) The evidentiary threshold necessary to make a decision based on all the uncontroverted evidence has been met. 3) There was an insufficient factual basis for the making of the custody order in issue. The matter was remitted to Queen's Bench for determination."
6_2009skqb201.txt,"A bankruptcy petition against the applicant was filed on May 18, 1995 and a receiving order with respect to her property issued the following month. KPMG Inc. (formerly Peat Marwick Thorne Inc.) is the trustee of her bankrupt estate. The applicant received an absolute discharge on March 8, 1996. The trustee has never applied for a discharge. The trustee did not oppose the applicant's discharge and in its report dated February 8, 1996 stated that the there were no facts, matters or circumstances that would justify the Court in refusing an unconditional order of discharge. Now, more than 13 years later, there remains an unresolved issue concerning non-exempt equity in the applicant's homestead. The applicant applies for relief under s. 37 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for an order reversing the trustee's decisions and restoring the property interest to her. The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that only the value of non-exempt homestead equity existing at the time of the bankrupt's application for discharge can be attached by the trustee. HELD: The Court made the order applied for by the applicant including an order for costs.","A bankruptcy petition was filed in 1995 and received an absolute discharge in March 1996. The trustee never applied for discharge. The applicant was at the time registered as owner of residential property in the City of Saskatoon having an exemption in the amount of $32,000. HELD: The order for costs was granted. 1)The trustee did not oppose the applicant's discharge and in its report, prepared pursuant to s.170 of the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 as am. by the bankruptcy and Insolvency Act stated there were no facts, matters or circumstances that would justify the court in refusing an unconditional order of discharge. 2)The respondent had some idea of what the realizable value of the property might have been in 1996 although there is no indication of how the potential sale price was arrived at. 3)The applicant was aggrieved by the trustee's transmission of 82% of her title. She says it was an arbitrary action taken without her agreement and knowledge. She also complains of the transmission being made without her having had an opportunity to oppose it because there was no hearing associated with her discharge. Her present application for a discharge should be vacated if it were not for the respondent's position that any increase in the equity should accrue to the benefit of the creditors."
c_2007skqb355.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery in this action pursuant to Rules 222, 231 and 232 of the Queen's Bench Rules and an order requiring the third parties to provide further and better disclosure of documents in their power pursuant to Rules 212 and 215. HELD: 1) A party to litigation cannot decline to answer questions on an examination for discovery that are intended to elicit the facts on which that party has based its pleading. A party is required to divulge the facts that it has now or admit that it has none if such is the case. The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that he can be further examined on the responses. If the position of the defendant as set forth in those responses changes as a result of after acquired information, the defendant shall so inform the plaintiff by way of supplemental responses within 90 days following the completion of the defendant's examinations for discovery of the third parties. If it is necessary for the plaintiff to further examine for discovery on the defendant's responses or supplemental responses, the defendant's proper officer shall attend such examination for discovery. 2) The material filed satisfies the Court that PSAC documents relating to the PST issue are at least broadly relevant to the issues and that BJ Services likely has the power to obtain and produce them. The fact that BJ Services may intend to claim a litigation privilege over the documents, or that PSAC may not produce them, does not relieve BJ Services of the obligation to disclose their existence. BJ Services shall provide further and better disclosure of documents by providing a detailed list of documents referred to in the second part of the second schedule of its statement as to documents. If a claim for privilege is asserted over such documents, BJ Services shall identify the basis of such claim, the date of the documents, the name of the sender and the names of the recipients.","FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery in this action. The plaintiffs also ask for further and better disclosure of documents over which a claim for privilege is asserted. The defendant maintains that the documents referred to in the plaintiff's Reply to the Government of Saskatchewan's Demand for Particulars form part of those contracts and set out additional terms and/or set out the intentions of the defendants in entering into the contracts. The third parties deny all allegations made by the plaintiff and the defendant as a third party claimant and specifically deny that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment in any amount against the defendant. HELD: The court will not unduly restrict an examination by excluding questions broadly related to the issues that may well be resolved by other evidence not before the court on the application. The broad relevance test is test of credibility and is based on the principle of the 'broad relevance test' which requires a party to answer all questions asked on discovery that are relevant to the matters in issue. In this case, the third party contractors collected and remitted provincial sales tax (PST) in respect of cement supplied and used by the third parties in the performance of their contracts with the plaintiff. The plaintiff seeks judgment for the amount paid."
b_2001skqb124.txt,"The medical doctor alleged the other medical doctors owed a fiduciary duty to act in good faith with respect to their agreement to perform on-call services for the District Health Board. Under the voluntary arrangement doctors who chose not to enter the arrangement remained on-call to look after their own patients and to respond to emergencies. It worked well until Hanna established another clinic and began dividing his time between Regina and the Moosomin clinic. HELD: The actions against the doctors and health district were dismissed with taxed costs.  1)Hanna's exclusion from the roster was authored by his own conduct. When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him. Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital. He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence. He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days. Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition. His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors. The on-call arrangement was voluntary. There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood. There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.  4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District. Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors. There was no basis in law or fact supporting the existence of a fiduciary relationship between Hanna and the Health District.","A medical doctor brought an action against three doctors alleging that each of them owed a duty of trust and a fiduciary duty to act towards him in good faith in connection with an arrangement entered into by all the doctors to perform the on-call services required of them by the defendant, the Pipestone District Health Board. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The common characteristics of a trust/fiduciary relationship between a doctor and a hospital are defined by the legislation as follows: a doctor has a duty to provide continuous care to his patients 24 hours day, 7 days week, and there is no evidence that the hospital formally approved the system or was party to it. 2)The relationship between hospital and its doctors, here defined as one which resulted in one doctor having privileges to deliver the patient care, was not compromised by the arrangement, nor was it an enforceable relationship. 3)There was no evidence brought into evidence that compromised the doctor's or hospital's moral or ethical standards or that the relationship was compromised by his failure to attend to the patient's requests or to diagnose an obvious condition. Neither the hospital nor the doctors were signatories to the Moosomin Accord. Neither doctor entered or left the agreement. 4)The court dismissed the plaintiff's action against the doctors and one against the defendant. It would be difficult to distinguish between the two allegations and treat them as synonymous."
7_2001canlii346.txt,"The Crown withdrew one count at the opening of the trial and the accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration in excess of .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician. HELD: The accused was found guilty. There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying. The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient. His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples. The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient. 3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required. 4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay. The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.","The accused was charged with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called as witnesses the boyfriend of the accused's sister-in-law and the doctor of a civilian who at the time was an inmate. The accused testified at trial that he had had the doctor complete the wrong form for the wrong reason and that the doctor advised him that the taking of the blood would not endanger his life or health. HELD: The Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had acted in the best interests of his life and that he was 100% sure that the blood was taken from the accused. The Court concluded that the facts in the mind of the officer when he decided to make the demand did amount to reasonable and probable grounds for his doing so. Based on the officer's evidence that he asked the permission of the doctor to take the samples and the evidence of the medical practitioner who testified that he did, in fact, have the doctor's signature on the label at the bottom of the vial, that the attending doctor had no reason whatsoever to taint his evidence by favouring either the Crown or the accused and had an excellent recollection of the events of the night in connection with this case. On the evidence as a whole, the Crown was not able to establish beyond reasonable doubt whether the officer had signed the certificate, whether the doctor had actually obtained information from the physician so that he could be Confident and Advise the Accused that the Taking of the Blood Sample Would Not Endanger the Life of The Accused."
d_2011skpc110.txt,"The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident. The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After being detained at the police station, he attempted unsuccessfully to reach three different lawyers. Eventually, he spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused argued the admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute as it would violate the accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights. HELD: The Court held the Charter breaches were moderately serious. The officer's reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body was not raised as part of the reasonable and probable grounds for making a demand. The Certificate of Analyses was admitted into evidence. The Court found the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes until the demand was made for a breath sample and a failure to obtain an ASD. During that time, he was detained for 11 minutes and a sample of his breath was obtained. The delay was of relatively short duration compared to the 33 minutes in Hatzel, but the Court found that the officer's grounds for demanding the samples were irrelevant as he did not have a watch and the breath sample was not available at the time of the demand. Finally, the accused acknowledged that he had not had a chance to speak with legal counsel prior to making the demand, but acknowledged that his right to counsel under s. 9 of the Charter had been infringed and that he should have been given an opportunity to seek counsel."
9_2005nssc297.txt,"The appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was suspended. The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle. Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal entered. The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle. But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.","The appellant appealed his conviction for driving a motor vehicle while suspended, contending that the adjudicator failed to properly interpret the provisions of s. 287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act, and by rejecting in total the evidence of the appellant's son and three other witnesses. Allowing the appeal, that the conviction was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence; there was insufficient evidence to prove that the appellant was in fact the driver of the vehicle; and other grounds as may appear from the record. The scope of the appellate review in summary conviction appeal is well settled. The Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed the importance of taking into account the special position of the trier of fact on matters of credibility. It remains open to an appellate court to overturn a verdict based on findings of credibility where, after considering all the evidence and having due regard to the advantages afforded to the trial judge, it concludes that the verdict is unreasonable."

The proposed appellants sought and obtained a writ of replevin in relation to the dogs. The proposed respondent applied for an order setting aside the writ, and ordering the dogs returned. The chambers judge granted the application finding that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information and that to allow the writ to stand would constitute an abuse of process. The issue on appeal is whether the chambers judge erred in inquiring into the accuracy of the facts sworn to in the proposed appellant's affidavit, in light of the provision in Rule 407(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules that provides that the validity of the writ shall not be questioned in any interlocutory proceeding where the affidavit substantially complies with the requirements of the Rule. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted. The ruling of the chambers judge raises an issue of considerable importance to the general operation of the writ of replevin as provided for in the Rules of Court.","The proposed appellants sought and obtained a writ of replevin in relation to the dogs pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 406-10. The proposed respondent provided an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $12,000 as security in accordance with the requirements of Rule 408 and the sheriff seized two of the disputed dogs in her possession. She then applied to the court for an order setting aside the writ, and ordering the dogs to be returned to her on the grounds that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted. While the issue of delay may be vexing to some, the Court's decision to grant leave to appeal is not of significant importance to this case."

HELD: (1)Application dismissed. The Provincial Court judge was not biased and the accused received full disclosure with respect to the charge. In an application to quash committal for trial there is only one ground for action by the reviewing court and that is lack of jurisdiction. (2)Application dismissed. The conditions imposed by the Provincial Court Judge were justified. He did not err in law or in his application of the facts.,"FIAT. At a preliminary hearing, the Provincial Court judge committed a defamatory libel against a police officer contrary to ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code and his complaint was with respect to an ongoing investigation of another potential offence. The accused applied to quash the order made by the judge committing him to stand trial on the charge and the complaint about disclosure. The preliminary and there was not ascintilla of evidence to suggest either the judge was biased or that there was an apprehension of bias.

b_2011skpc19.txt,"The accused was a passenger in a van where the driver was stunting on the complainant's street. The complainant was an off duty police officer who left his home and knocked on the passenger window. The accused exited the van and assaulted the complainant resulting in the complainant receiving a broken nose and ankle. The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer. The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer. 1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed. Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.  2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other. The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer.","The accused is charged with aggravated assault and breach of a peace officer. The accused pled guilty to two counts and in the information, being a curfew breach and an alcohol abstention breach on his undertaking. At the argument stage of this trial, the Crown indicated they were not seeking a conviction on the count related to the alleged assault on the complainant. HELD: The Court was left with the issue of whether or not a defence of self-defence was available to the accused and whether it was properly identified and therefore properly acting as a police officer in the line of duty. The Court found that the accused was guilty of both counts. The first count was a breach of the peace and the injury to the complainant's ankle which was a broken nose. The second count was an assault on a public officer which was clearly a wounding as the complainant was on his back on the boulevard beside the van and was being assaulted by the accused when the accused exited the vehicle and literally flew at the complainant, flailing his arms and fists and as result of him defending himself from the assault he fell and the assault resulted in his ankle being broken."
d_2004nssc196.txt,"The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants for breach of contract in regard to the defendants' refusal to return to her the substantial security deposit that she paid as part of a motel lease. After being clearly told that the money would not be returned, she waited 9 years before commencing the action. The plaintiff applied for an order disallowing the defendants' limitation defence. Application to disallow the limitation defence dismissed; plaintiff's action dismissed. The plaintiff's evidence did not show any valid reason for such a lengthy delay and the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled. Not only was there a presumption that the evidence would now be less cogent than it would have been, but the defendants' storage warehouse was destroyed by fire 3 years ago resulting in the loss of many old records, including those relating to the motel.","The plaintiff, through her numbered company, assumed the operation of the Maritime Motel by lease with an option to purchase. The lessor, Metro Computerized Bookkeeping, advised her that if the lease was not executed within a reasonable time, she would require the return of the security deposit. The action was not commenced until October 2001, full nine years after the cause of action arose. There was no evidence that the plaintiff sought or received legal advice during this time as she did not have any legal advice as required by s. 3(e) of the Limitation of Actions Act. The defendants thought that all outstanding issues with Cluett had long since been settled so they had no possible reason to give any notice to her respecting time limitations. In fact, prior to the signing of the lease, the plaintiff indicated that she resolved to do whatever was necessary to get the money back. The security deposit was never returned. The plaintiff's lawyer advised her to call Eric Corkum. HELD: The Court dismissed the application with costs of the action on the first ground that the defendants had no discretion in disallowing defence based upon the prescribed time limitation period. 1)The Court found that the delay in this case was a full nine year period and was a presumption that the evidence would be less cogent than it otherwise would have been. 2)The court found that there was no disability other than that alluded to in MacDonald's letter of 30 October 1992. This also seems to relate more to a personal injury situation. The lease was long time in process as evidenced by the fact that it was assumed that this was done on the instructions of the lessor. It is reasonable to conclude the plaintiff acted neither promptly nor reasonably by sitting on her rights for some nine years."

The Court had preferred to adjourn the discharge hearing for a period of 6 months. This would allow the Court to assess the financial circumstances of the bankrupt and her spouse at that time.

c_1999skqb209.txt,"FIAT. A defendant applied for an order pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court, alternatively s.50 of the Queen's Bench Act, for an order requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within 30 days; requiring a report to be filed with the court as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct his solicitor; and staying proceedings until a report is filed. The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate. The plaintiff alleged the issuance of the certificate caused mental anguish, emotional suffering, and loss of liberty and alleged conspiracy, abuse of process, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)Our civil procedure does not contemplate the trial of an issue on a person's competence to bring a lawsuit. A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act had the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding legal proceedings and would result in the appointment of a litigation guardian. This step was not deemed necessary based on the evidence presented. A stay was refused.  2)Costs incurred in defending a civil action against a person who is subsequently found to be incapable of managing his or her estate are recoverable from the estate. 3)Queen's Bench Act s.50 did not apply.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to his costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The plaintiff sought an order pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the Court or alternatively s.50 of the Queen's Bench Act for an order requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within 30 days and requiring a report from the said psychiatrist as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct counsel in this law suit. The applicants were reluctant to initiate the procedure to have the plaintiff undergo another mental competency examination due to this intervening law suit and the fear of being further accused of improper conduct or improper motives in doing so. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The Court was not obliged to take this step based on the evidence presented. The Act, despite its pejorative title, exists in order that the Court might control its own process. The Court should not be attempting to set down a new set of procedural safeguards for determination of a person's mental competence to engage in civil litigation, with the inevitable time and costs associated with the trial of such an issue, but is preferable that the procedures outlined in existing legislation be resorted to. 2)There was no need for the Court to invoke its inherent jurisdiction if the remedy sought was readily available to the applicant, for the simple reason that the issuance of a certificate would result in a litigation guardian being appointed."
8_2009skqb54.txt,"FIAT: Each of the defendants and third parties (collectively the 'applicants'), apply to stay either permanently or on an interim basis the plaintiffs' claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act. The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick. To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG). MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent. Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference. Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced. The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process. They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money. The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process. HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed. 1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.  'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act. The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications. They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses. The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act. That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction. The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act. The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed. They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. 2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case. There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions. That alone, without the assistance of s. 6 and the other amending provisions of the Saskatchewan Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that the action should be appropriately (but conditionally) stayed.","The plaintiff commenced his class action in June 2006 against the defendants, as representative of a class of persons, who claim damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides. The plaintiff filed an amended claim in November 2008 changing somewhat the description of the defendants and amending the claim to a multi-jurisdictional class action. The defendants applied to the Court to stay either permanently or on an interim basis, the plaintiff's claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act (the Act) now represented by an amended Statement of Claim. HELD: The Court held that virtually all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications were intended to be considered by the Court during the certification application of the plaintiff. The Court found that the application to stay was premature and an unnecessary duplication of resources and time. It would be preferable for the plaintiff to consider the application in preliminary application rather than to proceed to final certification. The application to remain in Saskatchewan was not intended to respond to or take advantage of recent amendments to the Act. It was also not appropriate to engage in an exploration of the general approach which Saskatchewan courts should take in the face of typical overlapping multi- jurisdictional class actions (see: Wuttunee v. Merck Frosst Canada Ltd. 2008)."
d_2004nssf61.txt,"The wife sought a divorce, custody, child support, a division of matrimonial assets and an order directing that the husband's equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child reached 19 years of age. She proposed to sell the home and put the proceeds, together with a new mortgage, towards the purchase of a new home. Joint custody awarded for all four children, with the father to have primary care and control of the oldest and the mother to have primary care and control of the three younger children; the father is to pay child support for three children in the guideline amount and the mother is to pay child support for one child in the guideline amount; the husband's equity in the matrimonial home is frozen at the amount owing on the mortgage when the parties separated and his interest is postponed until the youngest child reaches the age of 21 years; if the wife wishes to obtain a new home in a new location, she will be required to pay out the husband's equity in the matrimonial home.","The petitioner sought a divorce and custody, child support and an order directing that the respondent's equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child was 19 years old. The respondent sought to sell the home and build a new house and claimed that he was entitled because he stayed home and cared for the children throughout the marriage and lost his opportunity to enter the work force earlier. The husband argued that he would need to replace his vehicle, have a line of credit, pay child support of $25,000 and retire the septic tank at his residence. HELD: The respondent's request to postpone the child support payments was granted as a result of a permanent breakdown of the marriage was not supported by the evidence. The court ordered the respondent to pay $1,500 per month in child support plus $350 for orthodontic expenses and a further $40,000 for child support. An equal division of the assets and joint custody of the children was ordered, with the respondent having primary care and the remaining $35,000 to be paid by the respondent when he is not working or living in a mobile home with the children. Although there was some strain in the relationship, this should not interfere with the petitioner's reasonable access with reasonable notice.  1)The respondent's claim for spousal support, extraordinary expenses and maintenance was not considered by the court as a sufficient differential with a new mortgage that would be required to provide a new home to the petitioner. Given the particularly strained relationship between the parties, this will be a recurring expense for the respondent. 2)The court was satisfied that there was no evidence that the parties were unable to achieve a reasonable standard of living. 3)The children were to have access to their mother's home on any day of the week except for one day when she was not working. 4)The petitioner was to retain her own RRSPs. 5)Each party was to keep their own vehicle. The petitioner would have to pay support for one child in his care on a fixed monthly basis and had to choose between having the vehicle or having the child care expenses of $250 per month paid by each party."

The Trustee had been appointed by the Bank as custodian of the property of the bankrupt and claimed to be a creditor of that bankrupt. The Bank wanted to have its counsel nominated as solicitors for it. The solicitor for the Bank opposed the application on the grounds that there were significant areas of conflict with the interests of the Bank and that it should not be in a position where it could even appear to be influenced by the bank in making that decision. In this case, the solicitor argued that the mere existence of a claim by a creditor as against the petitioning creditor cannot per se be grounds for removing counsel.

HELD: 1)Application allowed. At the time that the applicants were served with the statement of defence and counterclaim, they were not represented by counsel nor did they know that they had to serve and file a statement of defence to the counterclaim. However, immediately upon being served with the garnishee summons they contacted solicitors. The application to set aside the default judgment was made as soon as possible after the judgment came to the attention of the applicants who have explained to the satisfaction of the court their failure to defend the counterclaim. The applicants have clearly shown that they have a good defence on the merits to the counterclaim. The applicants did not delay their application to set aside the judgment so that it cannot be argued that delay will cause irreparable injury to the respondents. 2)Application to set aside guarishee summons dismissed. There has been strict compliance with s.3(2) of the Act. The affidavits filed by the applicants challenging the affidavit for garnishee summons have no bearing on whether the garnishee summons should be set aside. It is not the function of a judge to look into the merits of the case on such an application. 3)Application for payment out of monies garnisheed dismissed. Section 14(1) of The Attachment of Debts Act provides that no order shall be made for payment out of any money paid into court by the garnishee when a garnishee summons issues prior to judgment until the plaintiff has recovered a judgment against the defendant.

Appeal dismissed and matter returned for a continuation of the hearing on the merits before the same adjudicator. The court has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal on an interlocutory decision of this nature. There can be no appeal from the Small Claims Court until a final determination is made.

The applicant sought to have the adjudicator sitting on an appeal of a Director of Residential Tenancies decision hear his application for a review of rental increase. The adjudicator made an error of law and was in excess of jurisdiction in determining that he had jurisdiction to hear the application of the respondent for review of a rental increase that had not been commenced within 30 days of notice of the increase. He also questioned whether the applicant had the jurisdiction to amend the Respondent's application as a Section 14 one and hear it as a Pure Declaratory Relief application. Application dismissed; the applicant was ordered to pay the sum of $50 to Dalhousie Legal Aid; in a further development, the applicant could not tender additional evidence as it would cost the court more money to entertain an interlocutory appeal.

The plaintiff claimed the creditor wrongfully converted monies after a full and final settlement of his account for a lesser sum ($2,000 on a $15,600 account). He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'. The plaintiff assigned his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application to his outstanding account in May 2001. In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle. An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died. The defendant says it was subsequently induced to settle the debt for a lesser sum by the plaintiff's false representation that SGI was suing him for between $200,000 and $300,000; that he would be found liable and would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy, making the account uncollectible. SGI initiated proceedings against the plaintiff in May 2002 claiming $17,660. The defendant contended that, if there was an accord and satisfaction, it was avoided due to mistake of fact or misrepresentation. HELD: The application for summary judgment was dismissed.

9_2002skpc30.txt,"The Crown applied for three DNA warrants pursuant to s.487.05 of the Criminal Code. Each of the three Informations sworn by an RCMP officer alleged the accused and his 19 year old daughter committed incest contrary to s.155, and a 7 month old child was born as a result. The Informations deposed that the Crown had obtained a DNA sample of the person who claimed to be the natural mother of the 19 year old.HELD: 1)No case was found dealing was a similar application regarding a possible charge under s.155. The words of s.487.05 were analyzed to determine its proper meaning and interpretation. 'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable. Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed. Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a). 2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations. The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable. There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking. The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out. The paragraphing format was confusing. 3)A DNA warrant application would be premature. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood. It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained. It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 487.05 of the Criminal Code for DNA warrants to obtain blood samples from the male, female and child. The Informations in Support were sworn by an RCMP officer. Each alleges that a middle-aged man and his 19-year old daughter have committed incest, contrary to ss. 155 of the Code, and that child, now months old, has been born as result of the incestuous relationship. The child is obviously not in any position to give an informed consent, instruct counsel or otherwise avail itself of the information required to be provided pursuant s.487.07. HELD: A DNA warrant application with respect to the baby would be premature, but may be renewed in due course if the Crown is advised of the necessity of providing some basic evidence which can satisfy the court that the technician or expert who will carry out DNA procedures is properly qualified to do so. The proper inference to be drawn from the words of s.485(1)(b) is that a warrant may be issued when some substance such as saliva, semen, hair, blood or like product produced by or carried by the victim at the time of the offence is found at or obtained in conjunction with a crime scene. There is nothing from the natural mother positively stating that no other person could be the father of the 19 year old female and the baby. The probative benefits of DNA analysis are concerned, but the crucial determination will be whether the father and mother have the requisite number of matching DNA characteristics, the DNA of the baby is not linked in any satisfactory fashion to the alleged father. This is especially the case when the relationship is shortlived. The natural mother has had no timely association whatever with the alleged offence. It is in the interest of the administration of justice to make sure that the information, if any, contained in the Registration of Live Birth concerning the birth father is of assistance in providing a complete picture for the court. The Court was of the view that, subject to the nature of the additional information coming to light, there could be a number of significant deficiencies in the information in Support which would need to be remedied if further consideration were to be given to the applications."
e_2007skqb179.txt,"Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer. The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement. Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement. The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test. The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement. The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly.","This is an application for judicial review of a Board of Arbitration Award which held that the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a Collective Agreement in force between the parties. The facts of the case are reasonably straightforward. The applicant is a First Nations faculty member who is First Nations. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with his academic freedom. The allegation had to do with the withdrawal of an invitation to the applicant to be the keynote speaker at a symposium. The Board of Governors met in April and the applicant received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Regina. That meeting ended with no decision having taken place regarding the matter raised in the applicant's letter. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The reasons as a whole support the decision. The decision meets the reasonableness test. 1) The applicant failed in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member.  2) There is no question that the applicant violated the collective agreement. However, the Board made a clear finding of fact that the alleged breach of the Collective Agreement occurred while the Board was acting in its capacity as Chair of the University's Board and not as an officer of the Federation. That finding brought the issue within the purview of the Agreement. 3) The formal grievance specifically refers to interference with the respondent's academic freedom in the second paragraph under the heading NATURE OF DISPUTE. These actions by FNUC and its Board are an abuse of authority and are harassing and intimidating actions against the respondent. In addition, the actions by the Board have interfered with the academic liberty of the applicant in violation of the FNUC/URFA Academic Collective Bargaining Agreement."

e_2006skqb519.txt,"The Bank presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent corporation respecting assets leased by the respondent to Sweeprite. By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease. This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business.","The Bank of Montreal (the Bank) presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent Patchrite (Patchrite) respecting assets leased by the Bank. The applications are brought pursuant to ss. 63 and 66 of The Personal Property Security Act.

The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than 1 year' within the meaning of the PPSA and it required registration.  2) The Court concludes that the lease was a lease for more than one year and is entitled to registration. 3) Patchrite is not and has never been a wholesaler or retailer of goods (personal property)."

The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children. The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time.","FIAT: This is a high-conflict family law matter. The mother wants to change her residence (and that of the two young children) presently. The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this year and beyond. The parties married in 2008 and separated in 2011. Two years ago the mother unilaterally moved with the children to Kenaston, notwithstanding an existing order of this court. She has formed a new relationship and she is pregnant. While the father has been in jail for a number of criminal matters, he was sentenced in October. His latest affidavit is not entirely clear on how long he will be in jail, but states he is eligible for early release in December 2013. These are fact-intensive and there is no presumption in favour of the present custodial parent. The children have access with their father while he is incarcerated. This matter has not gone to trial and is far from concluded. However, the mother's willingness (or lack of same) to ensure a connection between the children and their father may well be a factor in her remaining the primary parent."
2_2005nssc177.txt,"A real estate agent sold a condominium to an American and agreed to rent it for her for a fee. He deposited a security deposit and rent in his personal account and used it for personal living expenses. When the owner inquired, he caused a false lease to be provided to her showing the rental commencing two months later than it actually did; he then failed to remit some rent and was late remitting other rent. He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission. At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible. The Committee gave a written decision outlining the reasons for finding him guilty of five counts of professional misconduct, but failed to provide reasons for the sanctions imposed, which included a two year licence suspension and hearing costs of $10,000. The realtor appealed both the findings of professional misconduct and the sanctions imposed. Applying the standard of review of reasonableness, appeal from the findings of misconduct dismissed; applying the standard of review of correctness, appeal granted on the issue of the sanctions imposed; matter remitted back to the Committee for reconsideration, based on the principles of sanctioning outlined in the decision. It is patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions; reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible as to set out the reasoning process of the tribunal and demonstrate a consideration of all of the relevant factors.","A licensed realtor appeals the finding of unprofessional conduct made by a discipline sub-committee of the Nova Scotia Real Estate Commission and the sanctions imposed, including a two year license suspension and order to pay costs of $9,980.08. The Court found that the complete inadequacy of the explanation of the suspension, and the absence of any explanation for the imposition of the other sanctions, fails to meet the standards placed on the Committee. The Committee's decision was quickly made which did not reflect the time needed to consider the totality of the evidence presented. The decision of the Commission was patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions."

The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation. The Municipality refused to issue a letter to the effect that the premises were properly zoned for that purpose, arguing that the proposal would result in a change in use requiring a development agreement. The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use. Application granted; the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change. There was no evidence that the proposal would result in a nuisance or increased traffic, neither of which could be presumed.","The applicant sought an order declaring that the land use by-law of the respondent permits the operation of a licensed billiard club open to the public. The applicant had a special premises liquor license which allowed the sale of liquor, subject to certain restrictions including the following: 4) this license was for the use of members of the club only and not the general public; and 5) no advertising of the availability of liquor service was permitted. The change in the liquor license sought by the applicant would only have the effect of moving the applicant's use from one subcategory of drinking establishment to another. The club's use was not a 'change in use' as it was not defined in either the By-law or the Municipal Government Act. A development agreement was required."
3_2002nsca152.txt,"A supplier delivered computer books to an educational institution prior to the appointment of a receiver for the institution. Immediately after the appointment of the receiver, the supplier presented a written demand for repossession of the books. The receiver refused, claiming that the books were subject to an agreement for sale to the institution's students and therefore, exempt.  A judge of the Supreme Court agreed and the supplier appealed. Appeal allowed; return of books or payment of their value to the supplier ordered. Although the goods were supplied as course materials, the institution's contract with its students obliged it to provide, in its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program and the students acknowledged that it was necessary for the institution to change materials from time to time. The books had not been distributed to the students as of the date of the supplier's demand. The fact that the institution intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide these particular materials. Thus, the books were not subject to any agreement for resale within the meaning of the Act.","This was an appeal by a supplier from the refusal by a receiver to release goods to the supplier pursuant to s. 81.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The single issue was whether the judge erred in finding that the goods were subject to an agreement for sale at arms' length at the time the supplier presented a written demand for repossession. The fact that it intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide those particular materials. It follows that, as of the date of the supplier's demand, these books were not'subject to any sale for sale' within the meaning of s.81.1(1)(c)(v) and that the appellant shall pay the respondent costs fixed at $1500 inclusive of disbursements."
4_2014skqb177.txt,"Civil Procedure – Pleadings – Statement of Claim – Striking OutCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 7-9 The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants that included three causes of action: a claim against Xtreme Mining and Banga for wrongful dismissal; a claim for defamation brought against Banga; and for inducing breach of contract against Potash Corp. The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial. The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants. Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment. The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation. The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media. HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition. Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time. It allowed the application respecting the pleadings that related to an individual who was not a party and struck the paragraphs in question as irrelevant and immaterial.","The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants, Xtreme Mining & Demolition and Leonard Banga. The plaintiffs brought three causes of action and claimed damages over and above what might be referred to as normal damages. The defendants were alleged to have induced the plaintiff to abandon his previous employment and sought damages for actions that amounted to defamation. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants were using the contents of this statement of claim in an attempt to prove their allegation that the defendant had defamed them and their evidentiary facts contrary to prevailing Canadian jurisprudence. The applicants sought the following relief: 1) Rule 13-8 of the Queen's Bench Rules; 7-9 of the Rule 173 which provides in part that a pleading or other document may be relevant to determination of the notice that an employer induced an employee away from a previous position of employment. These particular pleadings are material to the plaintiffs' case as they are necessary to adequately define the nature of the action and to any moral damages flowing from it. 2) The defendants' references to motorcycle clubs and the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club in paragraph 67 would lead reasonable people to believe that the plaintiff was referring to them. They also suggest that the Defendants' conduct in terminating the plaintiff's employment was callous and showed wanton disregard for the plaintiffs dignity, feelings and well-being. 3) The plaintiff contended that the facts in para.50 are irrelevant as they contain indirect quotes attributable to the defendant and are not relevant to the issues to be tried. These are matters of fact relating to the plaintiff’s employment and the conduct of the defendants. 4) The statements of media outlets reproduced at para. 67(a), (c) and (d) describe the alleged defamatory statements with sufficient certainty, clarity and precision that defendants ought to be fully equipped to respond. The content of the impugned words is clear and unambiguous, and it is equally clear that such words were very likely spoken by the defendant to or in the presence of the respective journalists on or shortly before the respective dates of publication. As such, they are relevant facts to the issue of wrongful dismissal and any damages, including moral damages, flowing therefrom.  5) The entire paragraph should be struck as it is evidentiary in nature and should not be struck."
c_2009nssc180.txt,"At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007). Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009. The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years. The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines. She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it. The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands. Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward. The father's hardship arguments rejected. He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income. The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient. Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied. The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses. During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family.","The mother sought an order for parenting provisions and child maintenance retroactive to the date of their separation. Prior to the consent order, there was no written agreement or court order dealing with child maintenance. The father had made overtures to the mother for increased child maintenance but had refused to provide any additional amount. The mother applied for relief pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act in October 2007. Consent Order dated January 9, 2009 provided relief to almost all of the issues raised in the proceeding, including ongoing child maintenance beginning January 4, 2008. What remains for decision is what responsibility, if any, the father has to retroactively provide child maintenance since the couple separated in August 2001 up to the end of 2007. The federal regime appears to have contemplated limiting the recipient parent's request for information about the father's income to a three-year period."
e_2017skqb99.txt,"HELD: The application was allowed in part and the balance of images found on the computer were excluded from the evidence at trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The court found that the evidence found through temporary Internet sites was admissible. The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer. The police had no authority to search the computer generally. They were only authorized to look at the Internet history. The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right. The temporary files created as a result of the visits on the Internet was evidence of Internet history, and because of this connection, this evidence was not excluded.","HELD: The accused applied to exclude certain evidence discovered by the police during the execution of a search of his computer and cellular phone. The initial determination of whether there had been a violation of the accused's s. Charter rights occurred by the judgment dated January 3, 2017. The issue of exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter was not determined at that time. The trial resumed on February 6, 2017 with the Crown presenting all of its evidence. The results of the seizure were marked as exhibits for identification. The accused sought to exclude all of the images of child pornography located on his computer. He argued that this was the limit set forth in the warrant and, on that basis, its admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court rejected the application on the basis that there was no evidence presented of either the nature of the evidence seized nor the location from which it was seized. HELD: Application dismissed.  1)It is difficult to imagine a more intrusive invasion of privacy than the search of one's home and personal computer. Computers often contain our most intimate correspondence. They contain the details of our financial, medical, and personal situations. They even reveal our specific interests, likes, and propensities, recording in the browsing history and cache files the information we seek out and watch on the Internet. 2)There is no evidence to suggest either officer looked for, or even considered looking for, a picture of someone who might be the complainant. They simply did not look for a specific picture to attempt to either provide independent evidence or to provide evidence to further corroborate the complainant's allegations. This is so, despite the assertion that the complainant did not testify as to the accused taking any pictures of her. The complainant was not asked about this. 3)The Court was unable to devise a case law which would permit the Court to consider the application of s.24(2). The Court was not satisfied that the Court would not have granted the application had it not been for the necessity of a technical analysis of the entire contents of the laptop and cell phone. In light of the complexity of the issues before the Court, the Court was able to conclude that the laptop was used to browse the Web and that there were images of the complainant that were not included in the search history. There was no suggestion that either officer had ever asked the complainant for the information which he had acquired in this regard. 4)The court was not able to conceive of a breach with greater impact on the"
c_1994canlii4958.txt,"The Plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from the Defendant. He accidentally injected one of his fingers with paint. The finger had to be amputated. He commenced these proceedings against the Defendant seeking damages for a failure to warn him of the danger associated with the use of the paint sprayer. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.  1)The paint sprayer was of the 'airless' type. It operated at 2,500 lbs. pressure. This would not have been appreciated by the ordinarily prudent user. The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn. 2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor. Where an enterprise or activity is inherently dangerous, the duty to warn can not be delegated. In such a situation the party who retains the independent contractor remains vicariously liable. 3)The waiver in the rental contract was ineffective. It was a standard form agreement signed on its face with the terms of the contract on the reverse. 4)The Plaintiff was awarded general damages of $10,000.00, $5,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and recovered $3,789.50 for SHSP. 5)The usual increase in general damages for inflation and pre-judgment interest were both reduced because the Plaintiff had not presecuted his action expeditiously.","The plaintiff rented paint sprayer from a shop which was owned by the defendant. He signed a form of agreement and was told how to clean the gun part of the sprayer after completion of the work. No warning was given respecting any hazards in using the sprayers, and no warning was printed on the agreement. At issue was the defendant's liability forfailure to warn the plaintiff of the danger in using anairless paint sprayers. The plaintiff's finger was amputated after he unintentionally placed his finger in front of the nozzle.HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $18,789 plus $5,000 plus costs and pre-judgment interest. This interest was limited because the plaintiff ought to have brought the matter on a fortrial more expeditiously. The non-pecuniary damage issue was not quantified. The defendant was entirely negligent in failing to properly inform the plaintiff and his family of the risks posed to themselves and others when they were using the equipment."

An award of $700.00 a month spousal support was not unreasonable having regard for (i) the length of the relationship (approximately fifteen years), (ii) the husband's wage (approximately $55,000.00 per year) and (iii) the fact that the wife had seldom worked outside the home.","The father appealed the June 4, 1984 custody decision to his father, Harvey Fick.

He also found the mother's interpretation of events not to be credible. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. There was no order for costs. DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 25th day of June A.D. 1993. VANCISE J.A.

The tenants applied under the Residential Tenancies Act for the return of their security deposit and damages including moving expenses. The landlord was out of country at the time of the hearing but authorized by letter that the caretaker would attend the hearing to represent the landlord. The caretaker confirmed the tenants endured a protracted plumbing problem and restriction on bathroom use in the apartment. The hearing officer awarded the tenants half of the actual moving cost and 1 year of rent abatement. The landlord appealed the hearing officer's decision. The landlord alleged that he was not given the opportunity to be heard or to adequately respond to the tenants' claim as he received inadequate notice and alleged that the award of damages was unreasonable. HELD: The landlord's appeal was dismissed. 1) The tenant gave notice of his claim by two separate documents and the landlord showed no misapprehension of the tenants' position based on his written response. The landlord did not indicate in his letter that the caretaker had a limited role and the landlord could have sought an adjournment but did not.  2) Section 70(6)(c) of the Act empowers the hearing officer to order payment of damages where the hearing officer considers it just and equitable. The wording of this provision is broad and unconstrained excepting that the nature of damages that may be imposed must not be punitive. The decision on rent abatement was principled and to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space. The award for moving costs was intended to compensate for inconvenience, aggravation and related expenses. The awards were reasonable both in fact and law and no reviewable error was made by the hearing officer. Corrigendum released dated November 15, 2011 and added to fulltext.","The landlord appeals a decision rendered by a hearing officer under The Residential Tenancies Act. The issue concerned the tenants' claim for damages and return of the security deposit arising out of the landlord's notice to vacate. HELD: The Court finds that the hearing officer erred by failing to give the landlord an opportunity to respond to the claims and evidence of the tenants. The tenants failed to properly identify which area of the unit was unusable, failed to describe the relief sought or the nature of argument they intended to advance. Moreover, as the owner was unable to attend on the scheduled hearing date, the matter proceeded unfairly without an opportunity for him to be heard. The landlord's appeal is dismissed."

Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home. The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson. The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds. Lanson attempted to seize the home. The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.  HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet. The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security. 2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization. Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. 3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.  4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. 5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer. The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.  6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.","The issue on this appeal is the priority of security interest in a mobile home granted by the respondent to the respondent and subsequent purchaser for value, the Credit Union having regard to the operation of s. 28(1) and s. 30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The facts are not in dispute and are fully set out in the judgment of the trial judge. The trial judge found that the respondent, the secured party, had to authorize the buyer to deal with the security and that the buyer must know of the authorization. HELD: The appeal is allowed. The respondent shall have costs in the usual way on double Column V.

HELD:1)The father was to pay $454 for child support for the two children who lived with the mother. His proportionate share of orthodontic expenses was 86% ($1,677) to be paid by five payments of $280. 2)The respondent's average income over 1994-96 for the purpose of determining child support was $32,243.39. The 1997 income information was not included because the financial evidence was insufficient. 15% of the capital cost allowance was imputed pursuant to s19 for the 1994-96 taxation years. Deducting all of the respondent's capital cost allowance was not a reasonable expense. An adverse inference was not drawn from the failure to produce the financial records of the respondent's farming partner. 3)The applicant's average income for 1994-96 for purposes of calculating the s7 expense was $5,278.40. 4)The father was to pay $1,800 prior to April 30/98 as payment under the 1990 order. 5)The father was ordered to produce the documents referred to in s21 to the applicant by May 1st each year. 6)The applicant was awarded solicitor/client costs of her application to determine the amount of outstanding maintenance owing for 1996 and 1997 and her taxable costs on the balance of the application.","The mother brought a motion for variation of child support pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines.

No City employees were working on the site. ISSUES: 1)Is the picketing secondary picketing? 2)Is the manner of picketing unlawful in any event? HELD: Application allowed. 1)Picketing of the premises of an employer, where there is no direct dispute between him and the picketers or between him and his employees, is secondary picketing, is per se unlawful and cannot be jusified merely because the picketers are engaged in a legal strike against another employer who has business relations with the employer being picketed. 2)If the court had determined that the subject picketing was not secondary picketing, then, in the particular circumstances it would still have held that the subject picketing was unlawful, and ought to be restrained, as, on the whole of said evidence it was satisfied that the applicant had established that said picketing was not being carried on for the purpose of lawful communication, but, rather, was being carried on in a manner designed to obstruct, impede and interfere with the lawful performance by the applicant of its construction contract on the construction site.",The plaintiff sought an injunction restraining the defendants from engaging in secondary picketing on the premises of their employer. The picketers were obstructing the entrance to the employer's premises for up to 20 minutes and some of the employees were prevented from entering the premises for more than an hour.

The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear. A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized. The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The strip search was incident to arrest and conducted in a reasonable manner, being reasonably quick and non-invasive. There is nothing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent or guardian prior to a search. This was real evidence, the admission of which would not affect trial fairness; any breach was conducted in good faith; the search was motivated by a sense of urgency; and significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person.","The accused was charged with having in his possession, crack cocaine, contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. A voir dire held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search of the accused by police, and the admissibility of 17.8 grams of crack cocaine found on the young person. The police had earlier determined that the accused would be held overnight and taken to court the following day to be arraigned on a charge of possession of stolen vehicle. The accused had placed a call to a drug transaction and arranged for someone to meet him at an agreed upon location to complete the drug transaction. The officer told the accused that he could get the vehicle back by arranging a drug deal. At the time of the call, the accused said that he was concerned that the drugs might be in the vehicle and that it might be ingested, hidden or destroyed by the accused. Accused found not guilty of all charges; the search was motivated by a degree of urgency and necessity to prevent the loss or destruction of drugs; it was conducted for the purpose of preserving evidence relevant to the totality of the circumstances surrounding the arrest; and, in the event of a Charter breach, the evidence would nonetheless be ruled admissible. Although the accused's claim that he had been given the option of removing the object himself was not supported by the evidence, he reluctantly agreed to the search despite the refusal of his request to call counsel or his grandmother. The evidence did not establish that the officer had ordered the illegal search nor was it necessary to prevent it from occurring in the first place."
9_2014skpc205.txt,"There was contradictory evidence regarding the central issue of consent and therefore the court had to assess credibility. The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment. The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent. The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister. Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication. It was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused is charged with sexual assault of the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The charge arises from sexual activity that occurred between the accused and the complainant in December 2012. The complainant has no memory of the sexual activity due to an alcohol induced blackout. The Crown argues that there was no consent. The accused does not deny that he had sex with the complainant. He claims that the activity was consensual or, alternatively, that he has an honest but mistaken belief in consent. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The Court heard contradictory evidence with respect to the central issue of consent, an assessment of credibility, which is to be assessed in light of all the evidence. It is open to the accused to claim that the complainant's words and actions, before and during the incident, raise a reasonable doubt against her assertion that she, in her mind, did not want the sexual touching to take place. If the complainant did not consent, did the accused have an honest and mistaken belief that consent?"

On the drive home, she was injured in a motor vehicle accident when she fainted and her car crossed the centre line of the highway and struck another vehicle. She sued three members of the clinic staff, including the doctor who performed the abortion, alleging negligence in letting her drive after the abortion. Awarding the plaintiff $724,000 for past and future loss of income, future loss of pension, and general damages, that based on the evidence of the possible complications from surgery such as an abortion, and considering the emotional impact of an abortion on all women, the defendants breached their standard of care as health care professionals in permitting the plaintiff to drive after the abortion.","The plaintiff nurse took part in a separate action against the defendants after she was injured in a motor vehicle accident. The nurse advised against driving after having an abortion. The plaintiff also testified that she was concerned about the plaintiff's ability to drive home after the abortion.

Hospital who operated the 'MacPhail Vehicle' in an Easterly direction on a highway between the hours of 1:00 to 2:00 p.m. 2)It was a judgment call on the part of the nursing staff to determine if the patient was well enough to leave on her own. 3)The plaintiff was permitted to drive for a minimum of 24 hours following sedating medication. The driver was not permitted to have the procedure performed on her behalf for any medical reason. The medical reasonableness of the claim was based on the fact that most of the patients with whom the plaintiff had dealt in the past had had the procedure for some time prior to the procedure."
e_2007skca122.txt,"This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs.","This was an appeal from a decision of Madam Justice Rothery who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant (plaintiff), Kevin Miezianko, against the respondents (defendants), Bjorkdale Lions Club Inc. and Village of Bjorksdale (Defendants). The action arose out of the appellant's burns suffered when a fire from the gas tank located behind the driver's seat of the vehicle he was driving splashed on him and was set on fire shortly afterwards, after he had signalled his desire to have the contest halted and his vehicle had come to stop. HELD: The appeal was dismissed in its entirety. The respondents shall have their costs taxed in the usual way. 1)The action was preordained to failure in light of the evidence and the burden upon the appellant to prove each of the elements of his cause of action. 2)The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within five to six seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. The flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed did not cause the fire nor contribute to the extent of the damage. The appellant, who was an experienced demolition derby participant, assisted by four-man pit crew, had modified his vehicle to the required standards and to his own satisfaction in relation to its operation and safety, including the safety of an unconventional ignition system he had devised to give him an advantage in starting the vehicle whenever it stalled."

The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units. The remaining 29 units are residential. The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors. A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders. The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board. HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw. There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners. Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting. The proper interpretation of the bylaws has nothing to do with the principles of contract interpretation. The application was dismissed. The interpretation of the bylaw by the Board of Directors was reasonable and that Court was not prepared to interfere with it.","HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered a declaration interpreting the bylaws of the Condominium Corporation with regard to the election of the members of the Board with a view to determining the voting rights of the commercial owners.

d_2013skpc56.txt,"The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.","The accused was convicted of possession for the purposes of trafficking cocaine (Cocaine for the Purpose of Trafficking) and contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). The accused had been bound by a youth probation order for failing to comply with a condition that he not attend within the Province of Saskatchewan unless with prior permission of the Court or the Youth Court Worker). The Crown conceded that with this not being a violent offence and with his limited criminal record, the accused was not subject to custody under either s. 39(1)(d) or (c). The Ontario Court of Appeal provided some guiding principles on the use of s. 40(1) in its R. v. R.E.W. decision. HELD: The accused was placed on a 6 month deferred custody and supervision order on all three counts on which he was convicted. He was sentenced to 6 months deferred custody followed by 12 months probation. 1) The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the prime motivation behind the drug trafficking was financial gain. 2) The aggravating factors were: the accused's possession of cocaine and the fact that he was cruising around Kikinaahk Friendship Centre which is the main gathering place for older children and adolescents in La Ronge, Saskatchewan, selling cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The Court found that cocaine is highly addictive and very often results in horrifying violence; 3) the Court viewed trafficking cocaine in areas frequented by youth such as this one ought never be considered to be routine or usual. The accused is the only player in this community. The harm done to victims and others is intentional or foreseeable. The Crime Scene Investigation conducted at the Friendship Centre is an example of how this type of activity could be considered aggravating in a case where the Court would not want this Alberta resident coming back to the community to sell narcotics."
5_1998canlii13934.txt,"Landlord and Tenant - Writ of Possession_____ The landlord applied for an order for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The 41 month lease required a monthly rental of $500 for the first five months and thereafter semi-annual payments of $5,000. The tenants had not paid any rent in 1998 nor had they maintained insurance; they installed alternating stalls in the barn in breach of their covenant not to make any alterations or additions to the premises; breached the express and implied covenants to keep the premises in good condition and tenantable repair by their failure to remove and properly dispose of baler twine, to maintain proper weed control or to remove manure buildup in the calf barn. The tenants admitted the rental payment was due in May but claimed the landlord breached the pre-condition wherein Russell's husband promised to repair the damage caused by a 1995 hail storm. The claims for repair was far in excess of those provided for in the lease which were the tenant's responsibility._____ HELD: 1)The landlord was entitled to a writ of possession since the tenants were in breach of the covenant to pay rent for more than two calendar months. 2)A trial of the issue was ordered to determine whether the tenants were in breach of covenants in the lease. The matter should not be decided summarily where there are questions of fact or law. The hail damage may allow the tenants to claim in damages against the landlord but it could not be construed as a debt due for the purposes of s27 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The remaining alleged breaches could not be determined summarily.  3)Costs of the application were awarded to the landlord in any event of the cause.","The landlord applied for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The respondents were in arrears rent by more than two months and had failed to obtain and maintain suitable insurance up on their leased premises. The landlords were in breach of their expressed and implied covenants to keep the demised and demised premises in good condition and tenantable repair as a pre-condition to a lease wherein the landlord promised to repair the damageto the premises from a hail storm which occurred in 1995 and the damage has never been repaired. HELD: A trial of the issue was directed to determine whether the respondents were IN breach of the covenant to pay rent and the alleged failure to maintain proper weed control. The issues with respect to the hail damage and the claims for repair were far in excess of those provided for in clause 3.1 of the lease. 1)Under the landlord's covenants in the lease, clause 5.2, the landlord shall be the plaintiff and the defendants in any action and the Rules of Court generally will govern the conduct of that action. 2)The payment due May 1998 was not made because, they allege, Russell has breached the lease(clause 5.3) and because there was a condition to thelease wherein the tenant promised to fix the damagraeto in a timely manner by virtue of a promise made in 1995. The hail damage may allow the landlord to claim in damages against the applicant but it cannot be construed as a debt due for the purposes of s27 of the landlord and tenant act. 3)The remaining allegations raised by Russell with respectto the other alleged breaches of the covenants by the landlords were not determined summarily but should bedecided in an action (Vogelgesang and Kennedy v. WilliamsHoldings Ltd. (1981), 15 Sask. R. 336). Accordingly only two issues need to be addressed, namely the non-payment of rent and their failure to upkeep the premises properly."
3_2000skqb75.txt,"The applicant sought to vary the 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing spousal support of $2,500 per month. The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP. Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed. HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.  1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.  2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension. 3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions. However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired. The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home. She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property. The economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account (Moge). There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. 4)No costs.","The applicant applied to vary a February 1, 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing his obligation to pay further spousal support. The amount he was required to pay under the 1995 judgment was $2,500 per month. The application was triggered by the applicant's loss of employment and a debilitating leg injury. The parties had three children, all now adults living independently of their parents. The applicant supported them from the date of separation until 1993 when the level of support was set by a divorce judgment, to 1993 when it was discontinued. In 1995 they agreed on an equal division of their matrimonial property and consented to divorce judgment which ordered support of $1,500. The support was not time limited nor was it expressed to be subject to variation by the Court should the financial position of either party change substantially in the future. HELD: 1) There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. It was evident that the applicant had retired and had no intention to become re-employed and it was essential that he know now what his future obligations were. 2) The applicant had met the threshold for a variation application by demonstrating that there had been a material change in circumstances since the original order was last revised. Although this entitles him to have the Court review his obligation, it does not follow that his obligation should be terminated.  3) The application of these legal principles did not warrant termination nor a reduction of the quantum of the support. However, the respondent could also supplement his own income by selling his residence and purchasing some form of annuity. 4) Considering all the changes to the needs and means of the parties since the divorce, the position of the applicant was now worse while the respondent's was better. An adjustment period is called for in the circumstances."
c_2002skqb47.txt,"FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store. The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43. The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused. The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to. The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports. At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs. Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party. 2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages. 3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value. Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case. Expenses of each was examined separately. In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant. 4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee. A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel. The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court. It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant. Costs payable by the plaintiff on an interlocutory application may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs.",FIAT. An application to determine the issue of costs. The defendant sought to have the costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's second counsel was experienced and the plaintiff requested a fee of two-thirds that of the defendant's first counsel. He was not available for comment at the trial. 2) Expert medical evidence was of marginal value to the Court. The court found that more was obtained than set out in the offer to settle; extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to file medical reports and the costs were proportionate to the claim advanced. 3) Costs payable by the defendant to the plaintiff on interlocutory applications may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs.
4_2004skqb516.txt,"The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search. The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.  1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid. That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2) The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued. The search was therefore warrantless. 3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair. 4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis. 5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter.","Cst. Olberg applied for and obtained two Saskatchewan search warrants pursuant to s. 487 of the Criminal Code and s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The search of the accused's residence, the seizure of the money (and other items) and Smith's arrest were the culmination of an investigation that had begun many months earlier. These investigations concerned alleged illegal cross-border drug trafficking between the United States and Canada including evidence allegedly implicating the accused, Smith. The investigations were outlined in and the subject matter of two Informations to Obtain the Code and CDSA Warrants. The Crown argued that if both warrants were found to be invalid, then the resultant warrantless search of Smith's residence and surrounding premises was warrantless. The items seized during the search ought to be excluded as evidence at his upcoming trial by virtue of s. 24(2) of the Charter. HELD: 1) The evidence satisfies the Court that there was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The Court found that the RCMP officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Criminal Code and the CDSA. Having prepared the warrants, he neglected to review them with the care and detail necessary and appropriate to such an important exercise. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not in these circumstances bear directly upon the validity of the warrant, is nevertheless commented upon because of the effect of exclusion/inclusion upon the repute of the administration of justice. The issues to be decided as result of the voir dire are: 2) Are the warrants valid? 2) The Court accepted that a search warrant cannot be sustained. There was no similar specific requirement in the authorizing sections, however, saying that the offence must be stated on the face of the search warrant itself. The evidence obtained as a result of these seizures be excluded from the evidence at the accused’s trial pursuant to ss.24(2)(f) and (g) of The Law of Search and Seizure in Canada. 3) The affidavit filed by the accused and the affidavits of the only occupant of the premises were excusable. The subsequent recitation of the offences did not specify any dates or locations. The affidavit did not refer to any dates. Neither the date nor location contemplated for insertion in the warrant nor the listing of offences were substantively relevant. Neither of these matters was in issue at trial."
5_2011nspc8.txt,"The defendant entered into a plea agreement to a charge of sexually assaulting his young son but, shortly before the sentencing hearing, he applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he had not been fully informed of the nature of the allegations, partly due to a communication issue (English was not his first language) and partly because he had not viewed the video of his son's statement to the police prior to the plea. He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son. The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography. Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed; the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault. The defendant's motivation for pleading guilty did not alter his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation nor his understanding that he was, by his plea, admitting to that allegation.","This is an application by the accused to set aside his guilty plea to count #1, the sexual assault of his son. The Court found that the test in Nevin, supra, was not met and the application was dismissed. The Defense position is that the accused was not fully informed of the nature of the allegation, which was part of his motivation for pleading guilty, nor his understanding that he, by his plea, was admitting to that allegation. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Court was not persuaded that the Court's test regarding awareness of the consequences of a guilty plea extends to the impact of a plea on a decision of the Supreme Court Family Division regarding access to the child. 2)The evidence related to the accused's ability to communicate in English and purported admission of the offence and an expression of remorse could in part have been motivated by the troubles he’d caused his family. 3)The accused’s evidence regarding his awareness of consequences of his plea to sexually assaulting his son on decision of SCDF regarding access was not credible. The standard of proof is the civil burden. 4)There was no evidence the accused offered an innocent explanation of the plea to the alleged assault to the defendant as he testified."
b_1998canlii12364.txt,"The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult. The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue. The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult. The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989. The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court. The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision. It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court. Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.  1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges. If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth. The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.  2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application. R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts.",HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court to be heard according to law. The court found that a youth court judge could not assume jurisdiction in proceedings which were commenced in youth court where it is alleged that the offences occurred when the accused was either a young person or an adult. The accused was found not guilty. The jurisdiction of the youth court was determined by s. 5(1) of the Act and did not depend on the averments in the information or on proof of age. The principles set out in R. v. A. (E.A.) are applicable. The trial judge must inquire of the parties whether they wish to make a transfer application before accepting a guilty plea.
d_2010skqb173.txt,"The petitioner and respondent are the parents of twins. The petitioner father sought variation of a consent order. The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent. The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner. The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children. For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time. The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children. The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis. The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come. The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children. HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement. The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children. The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement. The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order. The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased. The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed. The respondent was awarded costs.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to vary the consent parenting judgment and the consent child support order. The parties were the parents of twins born August 28, 2005. The petitioner went on maternity leave from her position at the Calder Centre in Saskatoon. She then relocated to Regina to be with her family where the children were born. The respondent as single parent was able to access family supports after the twins were born in Regina. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) There has not been a material change of circumstance with regard to the petitioner's increased costs as a result of the shared parenting arrangement. However, there is some evidence that the petitioner has not worked as well as she would have liked and the children's care on that occasion have been substantially affected by the change. 2) The respondent has been successful in having the petition's applications to vary dismissed. She is entitled to her costs in the amount of $1,500 to be paid within 30 days.  3) The petitioner has failed to meet the onus upon him to establish that the material change in the circumstances of the child means that an application to vary custody cannot serve as an indirect route of appeal from the original custody order."
7_2001skqb10.txt,"The divorce action was based on separation for more than a year.  In issue were custody and access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)Divorce was granted. The parties, married 19 years, had been living separate and apart since January 1998. 2)They agreed to joint custody of both children. The son was to reside primarily with his father. The daughter resided with her mother. Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends. The children were to be together most weekends. School vacations would be shared. 3)The father was to pay monthly child support of $485 based on his gross salary of $61,200 which included a $1500 car allowance. Expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities did not qualify as a special or extraordinary expense. The father was to contribute his proportionate share (73% to reflect spousal maintenance) of orthodontic expenses not covered by insurance. 4)Spousal maintenance of $900 was to be reviewable after December 31, 2003. The mother's job advancement was impeded as a result of the marriage, specifically by frequent moves to accommodate her husband's job transfers. She had worked out of the home for limited income to facilitate child rearing. 5)The parties agreed the matrimonial home would be sold and proceeds divided equally after payment of expenses of the sale. Costs of any major repairs were to be split equally pending the sale. The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.  6)It was inferred the value of the chattels was the same as that at the date of the marriage. It would be inequitable to order a distribution of chattel property given as antiques or heirlooms by her parents valued in excess of $6,000. The inheritance from her aunt who died almost a year after the separation was excluded. The motor vehicles were divided in accordance with their value as of October 2000. All other matrimonial property and debts and obligations were valued as of the date of the petition. RRSPs were to be equalized as of October 15, 1999 by rollover. 7)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of his pension at date of the petition to a locked in RRSP in the name of the petitioner. The balance in excess of the maximum amount transferable under the Pension Benefits Act resulted in an adjustment of $2,042.75. The respondent was to assume any debts.  8)No costs were awarded.","The parties had been living separate and apart since January 23, 1998. The marriage had been established as a result of their divorce. The petitioner sought custody, access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of the matrimonial property. The parties had agreed on joint custody of their two children, born in 1978, 1979 and 1988, with the objective that the children be together with the same parent on most weekends. The respondent was ordered to convey one-half of the commuted value as of the petition to a locked-in RRSP in the name of the petitioner and to designate the children as beneficiaries of his life insurance for a period of time as determined in the Divorce Act. HELD: 1) The petitioner was not earning enough from her part-time employment to contribute other than nominally to the support of the respondent. The court found that the appropriate amount of spOUSAL maintenance was $900 per month, payable the first day of each month commencing January 1, 2001. 2) The court allowed time limited orders but the trend seems to be to avoid them in situations such as the present where the marriage has given rise to economic dependence. Once he receives his share of the proceeds from the sale of the residence he will no longer be carrying any substantial debt, at least not involuntarily. 3) The parties have tried hard to minimize the negative impact of the breakup of their marriage on their children. Spousal support will be reviewable at the instance of either party at any time after December 31, 2003. There is no evidence of any significant health issues."
2006nssc158.txt,"The parties, who were the parents of two children, separated after a seven year marriage. For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis. In the divorce proceeding, the mother, who planned to remarry and relocate, sought to become the primary caregiver of the children, with the father to have access only every second weekend. The father sought to vary the parenting time so that both parents would equally share their time with the children. Current parenting arrangement to remain in effect with the parties retaining joint custody of the children; table amount of child support set. The parenting pattern followed for the past five years had been working well for the children and appeared to be serving their needs; the mother's proposal would lessen the children's time with their father and the father's proposal would also create a significant change for the children, removing their current home base.","The court granted the divorce on the grounds of a breakdown of the marriage and the fact that the parties had lived separate and apart for more than a year prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The court retained the interest they acquired in their own pensions and the parties agreed to be designated joint custodians of the children. The mother sought to have the father's access to take place every second weekend and the father make child support payments in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines by paying a table amount in his income and by making a contribution to the $800 child care cost. The father sought to vary his parenting time so that he and the mother would equally share their time with the children, with the exception of Remembrance Day, when the children would be in the care of one parent for an extended period of time. HELD: The current parenting arrangements are in effect. The parties have been able to perform this difficult parenting task in their children's best interest. The more specific the decision is, the more restrictions are placed in the way of the parents continuing their successful performing of this function."
2_2009nssc364.txt,"The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008. It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time. At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment. The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support. He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement. The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce. The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008). The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable. He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife. The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement. This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act. It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome). The terms of the agreement must be given great deference. Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act? The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made. Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult. Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated. Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party. To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them. The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it. The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements. His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).","The parties married in 1995 and separated in 2006. They have four children, all of whom are now in a shared parenting arrangement. In 2008, the parties entered a separation agreement that provided for shared parenting. Since that time, the children have been primarily resident with the respondent mother. The respondent now seeks to have the spousal and child support obligations reflected in a paragraph of the 2008 separation agreement changed in as much as he seeks a corollary relief judgment that would not contain this obligation. The principal basis for the respondent's argument is that (1) a significant reduction in his income, and (2) a loss of income tax deductibility for his payment under clause 9 of the separation agreement because he is no longer in a sharing parenting arrangement because he has not met the obligation to pay $2,000 per month as required by s. 15.2(b) of the Divorce Act and (c) variation of an agreement incorporated into an order under s. 17. HELD: Application dismissed. 1) The Court's considerations are the same when called upon to set aside a separated agreement regardless of whether the application arises at the time it was issued, or in the context of an application to vary a Corollary Relief judgment. 2) There is no suggestion herein that the parties did not enter a binding agreement or that the agreement was not binding. The Agreement was registered with the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on June 17, 2009. 3) The respondent has filed financial statements identified as Exhibit B and as Exhibit C. The petitioner filed an Answer to the Petition for Divorce. In them, the Court admits that once material change has been found, court has a wide discretion to determine what amount of support, if any, should be ordered, based solely on the factors set out in s.17(7). 4) In this case, the respondent has agreed to pay only child support based on the tables reflecting his income of approximately $30,000. The child support obligation in that circumstance would be $750 per month. 5) The petitioner acknowledges that there are arrears on the mortgage on the home and that she is at risk of losing her program of study if the husband discontinues or does not resume payment of the Spousal support."
e_2004skpc101.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. The accused was charged on July 3, 2003 with common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code, threatening to use weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Code, and destroying property of value less than $5,000 contrary to s. 430(4) of the Code. On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court. The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources. On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004. On May 6, 2004, the trial was adjourned on application by the Crown due to the non-attendance of the complainant and new trial date was set for October 7, 2004. HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed. 1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months. This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry. 2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children. There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this. 3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking. As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused. 3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence.","Paddy Lemaigre applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. There was no Charter breach. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Court found no actual or inferred prejudice and that the conditions of release subject to release were not soerous as to result in any significant prejudice. The prejudice to the accused in the delay was not something that he could overcome. The delay of three months between the first and second trial dates was considered as attributable to the Crown, it being necessary because of the non-attendance of the complainant who was under subpoena to attend, and there was no evidence of any efforts by the accused to overcome this prejudice. As the accused had pled guilty to three offences of breaching his undertaking and was sentenced to three intervening offences, this prejudice did not outweigh the prejudice to society that would result if he was not to face trial."
c_1996canlii6728.txt,"Issues included the division of a pension, child and spousal support and whether to transfer or have sold the matrimonial home which had a small equity. The petitioner was an undischarged bankrupt and any funds in his possession belonged to the trustee. The only marital asset of any value was the petitioner's pension but lump sum payment was not available for five years as there was a liquidity problem. The parties had been 'spenders' not 'savers'. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support for one child. 2)Spousal support was denied. 3)The matrimonial home was to be sold and proceeds were to be divided equally.  4)Three values were suggested for valuation and distribution of the pension plan. The retirement method of calculating the value of the pension yields the fairest value as opposed to the termination method. The practice by the plan administrator on marriage breakdown was to divide the pension on the basis of the commuted value only and excess contributions were not considered for the purpose of the lump sum transfer to a locked in spousal RRSP. The options were to leave the funds in the plan and defer payment until age 65 or have the commuted value transferred to a locked-in RRSP. The respondent was to make the choice between the only two options. If she wished to have the funds in her name immediately, she was to provide written notification otherwise there would be an order that the respondent is to receive a portion when the monthly pension benefit commences.","A judgment for divorce was granted at the conclusion of the trial. The issues left to be determined were division of the petitioner's pension, the quantum of child support and spousal support and whether the matrimonial home should be transferred to the respondent or sold and the proceeds of the marriage divided. The petitioner was employed throughout the marriage and continued to be so employed. The parties were'spenders' not'savers'. Through the circumstances of the debts and Scott's bankruptcy, the wife had limited access to the husband's pension and the husband was an undischarged bankrupt.HELD: 1)The pension plan determined that the fairest way to calculate the value of the pension was to have the spouse receive the maximum allowable commuted value from the employer. She was to pay the husband $260 per month as child support for a period of 24 years.  2)The parties were engaged throughout the course of their marriage and each contributed the income earned to support the family. Most of the earnings were spent and few assets were acquired. The wife's primary asset was her police pension which was in good standing at the time of its creation. She earned $50,600 per year, $75,300 annually, and had two children, Chad and Ryan. 3)The wife had already reached the earliest eligible retirement date but had not retired. The husband's primary difficulty in up-grading his skills was affected by her illness in 1976 and the lingering disabilities of the spouses. These circumstances required the husband to either pay lump sum amounts or periodic payments based on valuation assuming retirement after 25 years of service. 4)The husband was required to make additional contributions but was not obligated to pay child support. 5)The court found that the maximum amount that could be transferred out of the spouse's pension plan should be $64,000."
c_2013skqb180.txt,"The parties had a shared parenting arrangement since separation where each party parented their four-year-old child for equal times in a two-week cycle, the petitioner parenting in her home in Moose Jaw and the respondent parenting in his parent's home in Regina. The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school. Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent. The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application. The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents. The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child. The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make. HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child. The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent. The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents. The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's. Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan. The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain. The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina. The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime. The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend. The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays. The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two. The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year. Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days. The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement.","HELD: The court held that the petitioner’s primary residence was in Moose Jaw and that it was imminent with the decision of where Madison would attend school. The court also held that it could not defer to the court to determine where the child’d residence was. As the petitioner was a stay-at-home parent, the court found that the respondent was a competent and loving parent. The child was normal and had been resilient in coping with the parent-child conflict and was better off without the parenting regime. The respondent was not seeking child support and was not attempting to obtain child support for either child."

The plaintiff claimed judgment for the purchase price and damages for repairs to the spreader. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed.

The accused made an O'Connor application for third party records relating to the two surviving Crown witnesses. In particular, the accused sought disclosure of police reports, videotaped evidence, witness statements, warned statements regarding the multiple arrests and charges incurred by the victims and disclosure of their criminal records. In 2012 SKQB 543, the Court ordered production of the records. This decision deals with whether the documents should be produced to the accused. HELD: The documents were disclosed to the accused. The judge vetted the documents to black out words, phrases or numbers that have no probative value or where the privacy interest of the witness would have been unjustifiably affected.",HELD: The Court granted the application. It found the issue of disclosure only and the manner in which the documents and the information contained can be used in examination or cross-examination of the witnesses at trial was not determined. The Court also directed the Crown to provide updated criminal records for each of the accused. Counsel were to receive copies of the same documents as are being released to counsel for the accused and requested that they be given to them. The Crown also sought the services of the RCMP in respect of two Crown witnesses and in particular offences for which these two individuals had previously been convicted. The accused's interest in obtaining disclosure for the purpose of making a full answer and defence outweighed any residual privacy interest held by third parties in the material.
d_2011skqb62.txt,"The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon. The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants. At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience. No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon. The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed. The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon. The Crown appeal was dismissed.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the accused on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon contrary to s. 90 of the Criminal Code. The Crown appeals on the grounds that the learned trial judge misapprehended the evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The Crown's appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge was aware that it was readily available in novelty stores. As he had no bag or back pack in which to carry it, he tucked it into his shorts. He did not testify as to his eye witness perceptions, but about the sword and where it could be purchased. 2) The Crown argues that the sword should have been found by the trial judge to be a prima facie weapon, in the same manner that a firearm, or brass knuckles or other inherently dangerous items are considered weapons. On this basis, sword would be distinguished from knife, which is not necessarily weapon. There is nothing to show that the knife in question was designed to be used as a weapon: when it is closed, it is as innocuous as any other jackknife; in order to open it, two hands must be used; the locking device renders the knife safer than it is used for peaceful purposes. The accused testified that he had just purchased the sword for $10 from someone named 'Froggy'. He said that he tucked the sword in his shorts as he was walking home. He also stated that in his opinion the sword was a novelty sword. No attempt was made by the Crown to call evidence to contradict his testimony. 3) The question is whether, though probative, the evidence must be excluded by clear ground of policy or of law. The Court reviewed the evidence and found R. v. Graat (1982) S.C.R. 819 in accepting the accused's evidence. It was not necessary for the party proposing admission to demonstrate that the witness is unable, because of the nature of the subject matter, adequately to convey to the trier of fact the data from which the inference has been drawn or the generality of the evidence. 4) The Court found that the Crown had not established that the accused had either used or intended to use the sword within the meaning of s. 2 of the Code. However, it could conclude that he likely came from a novelty store."
b_2006skqb183.txt,"The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years. The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","The plaintiffs sued the defendants pursuant to Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules for damages arising to them from alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd. The plaintiffs' home was adjacent to one another and abut the ninth hole of the golf course. The defendants' golf course was designed and built in the late 1980s without any residential development adjacent to it; however, in 1997, the defendant entered an agreement with Parkview Homes to open up the land beside the Golf Course for residential development. The defendant, which operated the course for more than 10 years without approving a golf course design, brought an application for injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which had continued for the past nine years. HELD: The Court ordered the defendants to pay the plaintiffs $18,000 for the loss of use and enjoyment of their property over the next nine years and ordered a specific course of action that the defendants should take to remedy the problem.  1) The defendants refused to accept either of the recommendations in the report. The Court was not prepared to order the specific route of action as the matter had not yet been resolved. 2) The plaintiffs were awarded judgment for $6,000. 3) The defendant were ordered to pay $8,000 in damages to the plaintiffs for the damage caused from the golf balls which were hit from the adjacent golf course in the past 9 years.  4) The plaintiff's claim for damages was dismissed. 5) The Court refused to order an injunction to prevent the defendants from operating the 9th hole until the situation was remedied in accordance with the recommendations therein.  6) Since the plaintiffs cannot succeed because the wording in the Optionee's Indemnity clause as contained in s. 2.12 of the Option Agreement between Great Plains and Parkview did not reflect the reality of the situation at the time the plaintiffs purchased the property."
2000skca99.txt,"See also 150 SaskR 185.In 1998 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's sentence appeal and appeal of his 1997 convictions which consisted primarily of sexual offences involving family members and others. The sentence of imprisonment was increased from 5 to 10 years. The applicant, on advice of two counsel, did not initially seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. He changed his mind 2 years later and sought an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal. The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision. HELD: The application was dismissed without prejudice to reapply should leave to appeal be granted. 1)The application was premature. The application pending before the SCC was likely to be determined within 3 to 4 months. The Court of Appeal was not satisfied the appeal as a whole was not frivolous having regard for the requirements of s.679(3)(a) and (c). Some grounds for appeal would clearly fail such as the ground the Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess on the basis of the incomplete material before the court. 2)His continued detention was necessary in the public interest having regard for the whole of the circumstances. His release would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.","The applicant was convicted in July 1997 of several offences, consisting in the main of sexual offences involving members of his family and others close to him. He appealed against his convictions, and the Crown appealed against their sentence. On September 16, 1998 this Court dismissed his appeal against his conviction and allowed the Crown's appeal, increasing the sentence from five to ten years. Throughout, the applicant was represented by senior counsel Mr. S. Halyk Q.C. The applicant decided not to seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court on any of the grounds raised in the original application and instead decided to apply to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time to apply for leave and to appeal on one or two of the comparatively stronger grounds. HELD: The application for release was dismissed and the sentence was increased from 5 to 10 years. The Court was not satisfied that the prospective appeal as a whole was not frivolous and that the applicant's continued detention for the time being was not necessary in the public interest. The present release of the applicant would be inimical to the general public interest, given the history of the past proceedings, the current state of the present proceedings and the fact that it would tend to undermine the administration of justice in the United States, given that there is no prospect of any Russian intervention in the affairs of the C.P.A. without the assistance of the SCC on some of the more serious grounds."
2_2001nssc164.txt,"The applicant applied for an order directing the removal of a ground sign which violated its' Municipal Planning Strategy and Land Use By-laws. The respondents argued that the applicant's by-law violated their rights under s. 2(b) of the Charter. Application allowed; respondents directed to remove the ground sign; if the sign is not removed within fifteen days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents. Although advertising is a form of expression and falls within the scope of sec. 2(b) of the Charter, the purposes of the by-laws (maintaining a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown, minimizing adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reducing safety concerns) were both pressing and substantial and the limiting measures were rationally connected to the objectives. The by-laws had a minimal impairment on the rights of the respondents, as advertising was not prohibited but only limited.","The Town applied pursuant to s266 of the Municipal Government Act for the removal of a ground sign erected in the Town's downtown core zone. It was alleged that the by-laws restricted the respondents’ freedom of expression by prohibiting overly large billboard type signs and by reducing the proliferation of signs with the requirement that the signs relate to the property on which they are located. The by-law also prohibited the use of signs in the business district, minimizing the adverse impacts of signs on adjacent properties and the street scape. The Town acknowledged that the sign offended the Town’s Land Use By-law but argued that it was not necessary to regulate the erection of the signs on private property. The application was allowed and an order was issued directing the respondents to remove the ground sign. If not removed within 15 days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents. Costs to the respondents were set at $1,500."

The applicants challenged the decision of the Labour Relations Board as being patently unreasonable and that the word removal as found in s43(1)(c) read separately or in conjunction with the remainer of the section could not reasonably be interpreted to include closure of a business or part thereof so as to constitute a technological change within the meaning of s43.

HELD: There was an order quashing that portion of the order dated Jan 5/98. It would not be appropriate at this stage to deal with the application for an injunction. Rather, the matter was remitted back to Labour Relations to be dealt with having regard to the prior notice to my finding that the closure of the vacuum division was not a 'technological change' within s. 42(1) of The Trade Union.

Because of disputes over ownership between the plaintiffs and the plaintiff, the latter commenced an action against the plaintiffs seeking declaration as to the validity of the tax sale. The Municipality later sued the plaintiff and the defendant for general damages. The trial judge allowed certain of the purported damages, essentially legitimate cost items relating to the sale, but overturned the trial judge on the claim for legal costs incurred at the first trial, which were set forth as $39,385.82. The grounds for the reversal were that this item of damage was too remote, not foreseeable, and it was not reasonable for that first action to have been embarked upon when the true state of affairs could be discovered upon reasonable investigation. The present action is by the defendants in that first case to recover its legal fees and some other items of loss and general damages with interest. The specific damage alleged may very well have been caused by vandalism or would have occurred in any event to a property left vacant through winter months, the defendants must be held responsible."

HELD: 1) The defendant denied liability for any share in the costs referred to in the Supplemental AFE. 2) The plaintiff was not entitled to information concerning the Well. 3) Costs in excess of the Original AFE were determined by the Court based on the third paragraph of Clause 301 of the CAPL 1981.

6_2003skqb61.txt,"FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001. Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc. The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000. Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship. The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4). Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment. The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate. Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not. To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1).","FIAT: This application by two siblings to act as personal decision-maker and property guardian for their 68-year old mother was opposed by the Public Trustee insofar as they request they be appointed property guardians without the necessity of a bond. HELD: 1) A commercial bond is expensive. The risk is too great for a one-year premium. In many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets which equal or exceed the value of the estate to be administered. The court could order more than one bond be given in order to limit the liability of surety to an amount that the court considers reasonable. 2) This is a routine application by siblings, who are most usually the applicants, and to consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for filing a bond contained in s. 55(1). Almost every application would so qualify, because in most cases the nearest relatives always consent. 3) This conclusion is not reflection on the integrity of the applicants which have no reason to doubt. It is not a reflection on their integrity. The fact is this is one of number of similarly contested cases by the public trustee since the new Adult Guardianship and Co-decision-making Act, S.S. 2000, was proclaimed."
6_1999canlii12377.txt,"A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second. Two passengers were knocked unconscious. One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty. His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances. The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield. The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision. It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.  1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3). The right of way, however, is not absolute. As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor. It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on. Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor. Alcohol was not a factor. Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights. 3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","This was a charge of failing to yield contrary to s. 50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The defendant stopped at an intersection for 15 seconds to allow several south-bound vehicles to go by, and then began his left turn. The plaintiff's passenger was knocked unconscious and received a cut to the head requiring three or four stitches. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty.  1) The defendant's actions did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary drivers faced with similar circumstances and that with respect to the failure to yield the defence of due diligence has been established. The court found as a fact that when the defendant commenced his turn, any vehicle lawfully approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision. 2) On a balance of probabilities the defendant was entitled to assume that it was safe to do so, as there did not appear to be any other vehicles close enough to the intersection to present a hazard."
c_2007skqb269.txt,"FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school. They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed. HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case. 1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case. The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity. There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council. There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided. No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election. The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding. The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made. To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process. 2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair. A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter.","FIAT: The applicants seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing and restraining the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution passed by the Board on May 7, 2007 that the Wilcox Public School be closed effective August 15, 2007. The grounds for the application are that the Board provided inadequate notice of an election for the Wilco school community council and it is alleged the election is nullity. As result there was no council for the Board to consult with as required by The Education Act, 1995. The court also notes that the respondent failed to comply with the requirements of procedural fairness in the manner in which they proceeded to pass the resolution closing the school. HELD: 1) A preliminary review of the facts and law does not suggest a strong prima facie case. 2) Procedural fairness is an appropriate standard to apply in cases where the factual record is largely settled prior to the application being made. 3) The three criteria to be assessed when considering whether or not a mandatory injunction should issue are the merits of the case, whether there is a serious question to be tried, whether the Board has met its statutory obligations, and whether the issuance of an injunction would create greater harm to the respondent. In this case, the court found that 1) the board failed to provide proper notice of the election and 2) it ignored or did not directly respond to all of the submissions made by the persons in opposition to the school closure. There was no suggestion the applicant would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction were not granted. 4) On the facts, the Court found that the applicant did not take issue with the formalities for the meetings, the potential consequences of a court finding of nullity, or the subject matter of the legislation. It was not necessary to decide whether any of these limitations may be disregarded without entailing nullification of an act done otherwise than in the prescribed manner."
2_2004skqb62.txt,"FIAT: The issue to be resolved was whether the petitioner had produced all relevant financial information in order for the Court to determine the amount of maintenance to be paid by her. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs in the amount of $500 to the petitioner. Neither the petitioner's father nor the petitioner's husband was a party to the proceedings. To require them to produce their financial records, in the absence of even the slightest evidence such production would disclose anything which would in any manner assist in determining the amount of child maintenance payable by the petitioner, would be totally unjust.","FIAT. When the 1999 judgment was amended to provide that the primary residence of the child should be with her father, the question of the payment of maintenance by the mother was adjourned pending fulfilment of the requirement that she produce all information relating to her ability to pay maintenance and for her examination by the respondent to determine her income. HELD: The examination was completed and by agreement of counsel the questions to be resolved were whether the mother had produced all relevant financial information, and whether a trial should be directed as to the amount of maintenance payable by her. Counsel for Mr. Overs submitted that the financial records of the trucking corporation, owned by his wife, should be disclosed as they were not kept in the respondent's home and did not have the filing information required for their examination. Whether that submission had any merit was to be heard at viva voce hearing. Neither counsel could find anything to support the assertion that the petitioner should be required to produce her father's business records or to obtain full particulars of the cattle operation in which the petitioner was engaged or the petitioner's income was being canvassed would be determined because the petitioner could not find anything of the sort which would assist the respondent in determining her entitlement to child support. Neither the petitioner nor the respondent could afford to pursue such a course. Neither would they have the benefit of a trial of the issue if the child had not produced all the relevant information and counsel's fees were increased."

Prior to the commencement of the hearing, defence counsel was aware that the Crown did not intend to call this person as part of its case. One month prior to the preliminary hearing, defence counsel requested that the accident reconstructionist be made available as witness. The Crown advised defence that the officer was out of the country on peace keeping mission. The officer was expected back within months of the commencement of the preliminary hearing. HELD: The defence request for an adjournment was granted. The Court could not be satisfied that the officer was not a material witness to the preliminary inquiry. The Court was not satisfied that defence was guilty of neglect in failing to procure the officer's attendance when they had been advised by the Crown that he was out of the country. The length of the adjournment would not be lengthy.","The accused was charged with committing an offence under s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code and, at the time of committing the offence, knew or ought to have known that his operation of the motor vehicle caused an accident resulting in bodily harm to another person. The Crown had declined to call any of the witnesses it had called. The accused came before the Court for preliminary inquiry on July 26, 2010. After Crown called all of their witnesses, asked Defence Counsel if they had any witnesses to call on the preliminary inquiry and he advised that he wished to call Sergeant Barbar as a witness. Defence Counsel opposed the adjournment request. HELD: The Court granted the application for an adjournment so that the Defence could make necessary arrangements to be able to cross-examine Sergeant Barbar when he appears as their witness.  1) The primary purpose of preliminary inquiry is to satisfy the justice that there is sufficient evidence to put the accused on trial, with the result that the Crown has discretion to present only enough evidence to establish a prima facie case. 2) However, it cannot be certain that Sergeant Barbar is not a material witness in this preliminary inquiry. He was present at the accident scene and took measurements, made notes and did some calculations. How he did his measurements, the assumptions and notes he made and the formulas he used to do his calculations may prove very material especially since the Defence has engaged their own accident reconstructionist. 3) The Defence is not negligent in not going to the trouble and expense of preparing a subpoena that could not be effectively served on him in any event."
e_2014skpc35.txt,"The Crown found the accused not guilty. With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address. The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary. Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice. Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present. All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel. Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence. There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 259(4) of the Criminal Code. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The accused provided proof that he was disqualified from driving, that his birthday was September 24, 1990, the date on which he was found eligible to obtain a driver’s licence and that he had been warned that if he lied about his identity, he could be charged with obstructing a police officer. The Crown sought a Certificate of Disqualification and Notice of Intention from SGI for identification. HELD: Although there was no identification in court, the accused was arrested and read his rights to counsel. Subsequently, he was released on an Appearance Notice that forms part of the court record and is clearly signed by the accused. The Court had no doubt whatsoever that the person named on the Appearance Notice was the same person who had stood trial."
e_1999skqb106.txt,"FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.","The plaintiff corporations brought an action against the defendants for negligent and reckless helicopter shuttle operation to and from the work site. The defendants claimed liability insurance for the loss of nine of the 11 crew members who died when their helicopter collided with the plaintiff's vehicle. The plaintiff sought to have the defendants answer questions as to when airfare tickets were reserved, the cost of such tickets, the reliability or safety of the helicopter, and other relevant matters were to be determined. Application dismissed; questions directed at when the helicopter transportation was unsafe were not accepted; the claimed privilege was too broad and prevented the plaintiff from ascertaining the names of potential witnesses; questions about the history of the e-mail system were not relevant as they were not raised by the pleadings; and if the predominant purpose of all such memoranda and expert reports was contemplated litigation, rather than the prevention of similar accident, the plaintiffs would be entitled to ask the trier of fact to draw their own conclusions. The report of the safety officer at the main camp site was not privileged because he was requested to prepare a safety report prior to the accident but did not get around to it until after the accident. There was also an official aircraft investigation report prepared with respect to the helicopter accident which was made available to all parties. The conclusions of the investigation were at issue as was whether liability insurance was obtained through an arranged arrangement, whether the insurance companies were obliged to pay the premiums, if any of the passengers were directly or indirectly involved in the transportation, and if so, if the defendants knew the helicopters were unsafe."

b_1999canlii12440.txt,"In the first application under the Family Maintenance Act the father sought to reduce child maintenance of $250 per child per month to an amount in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines; cancellation of arrears of $13,273.39; and increased access. In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck. HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.  2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears. Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to a support payable prior to 1997. The father's income was sufficient for him to pay child support for 1996 and 1997. Arrears for 1993 to 1995 inclusive were reduced as he was not able to pay according to the order at those times. Upon payment of $5,000 the balance of arrears accrued prior to December 31/98 would be extinguished. 3)The father was to pay child support of $325 per month for the two children. Garnishment of his wages by the Maintenance Enforcement Office were to be limited to $175 per month for arrears plus the current maintenance due. 4)The parties agreed the father should have access not less than one full weekend per month upon two weeks prior notice plus when he was available to attend at the city in a manner consistent with the children's best interests and their need to be available for school.","Two applications before the Court under the Family Maintenance Act s.10 seeking an order providing for the following relief: 1. Variation of child maintenance payable pursuant to the 1993 order by reducing the maintenance payable thereunder from $250 per month for each of the three children to the amounts specified under the Federal Child Support Guidelines as adopted by The Act; 2. Cancellation of arrears of $13,273.39 in maintenance payments accrued under the order; and 3. variation of access provisions of the order with the view of providing him with greater access to the children. HELD: 1) The respondent was not in a position to pay the full monthly maintenance provided by the Order. The principles of law governing child support for infant children are well-known and specifically provided in The Guidelines and The Act. The principle of law applicable to child support in the circumstances is canvassed in Currie v. Currie (1989), 74 Sask. R. 52; 18 RF L. (3d) 20 (Sask. C.A.) (1994), and Merryweather v. Merryweather (1994). With respect to the first issue, the Court was not prepared to hear her application and advised her to apply by notice motion with appropriate supporting affidavits. 2) The petitioner's gross annual income is $22,993. It is agreed that the respondent should have access not less than one full weekend per month between 6:00 p.m. on Friday to Tuesday and 2 weeks prior notice together plus other periods of time when he is available to attend at Saskatoon for the purposes of exercising access in a manner consistent with the best interest of the children including their need to be available for school. 3) The Court was unable to hear the application because the petitioner did not proceed by way of notice motion nor did she file appropriate affidavit evidence in support of her application."
d_2001nssc18.txt,"The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave. The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority. The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority. The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision. Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made.","An application for judicial review of a labour arbitrator's decision that the wording of collective agreement between the parties was wide enough to encompass the situation. The appellant alleged that the reduction of her work hours constituted a violation of Article 9 of the collective agreement. She sought allotment of work hours based on her hotel seniority and recovery of her loss of wages attributable to the reduction in her hours since Ms. MacMaster's maternity leave. The hotel argued that any reduction in work hours should instead have been predicated on hotel juniority, which was greater than that of each of the three other employees on the front desk departmental seniority list. The arbitrator found that the hotel had breached Article 9:01 by reducing hours of work for employees returning from maternity leave by 90% because another employee with greater departmental or higher level returns from leave. She therefore filed a grievance against the employer. The employer appealed the decision. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the portion of the decision that was patently unreasonable and allowing the court to intervene where it did not reasonably expect the employer to intervene, that the decision is patently reasonable. The court found that there were two linguistically possible interpretations of the clause and that the arbitrator could have used them both. The first was the interpretation that the clause refers to a reduction in the number of employees within the department and not the total number of hours."
b_2014skca82.txt,"The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed. The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal. The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so. The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony. The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed. The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous. The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial. The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial. The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial. Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondent from a charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to s. 249(3) of the Criminal Code. The Crown was tried on this charge before judge alone and was acquitted on October 10, 2013. The respondent was acquitted of the charge. In the reasons that follow, the Crown argues that the trial judge did not consider that the appellant's speed was anything more than 93 to 99 kilometres per hour or that it was objectively dangerous in all the circumstances. HELD: The Crown's appeal is dismissed. 1) The Crown has failed to overcome the heavy onus required to overturn appeals from acquittals under s. 676(1)(a). 2) The trial judge correctly stated and applied the elements of the dangerous driving. The Court was not satisfied that the Crown has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's speed needed to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 3) Based upon the opinion of R. v. B.(G.), [2008] S.C.R. 48, Sopinka J. held that a significant fault element is required in order to establish dangerous driving for the purposes of the imposition of criminal punishment. While the conduct of the accused may very well constitute civil negligence, in this case it was not dangerous to the public in all of the circumstances so as to establish criminal negligence. 4) References to proving speed beyond a doubt are troubling, as excessive speed is neither the actus reus nor the mens rea of dangerous drinking. However, this is an error of law which must be met to satisfy the Court with a reasonable degree of certainty that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same. 5) The Court is prepared to accept that an accused who has been acquitted once should not be sent back to be tried again unless it appears that the error of some sort has had a marked departure from the standard of care expected of a reasonable person in his circumstances. In this case the Crown failed to meet that standard."
2001skqb148.txt,"FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs.","Three motions were brought pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(a) and 188. The motions were based on Rule 188 of The Public Officers' Protection Act. With the consent of the plaintiff, it was ordered that the action against the Attorney General be dismissed. The remaining substantive issues were whether the action was barred by a statutory limitation period, whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc, and whether the plaintiff had a prima facie case. HELD: The applications were dismissed with costs under double Column V and the other issues were set aside. 1)The limitation period did not commence to run until after the expiration of the 1 year limitation period. 2)With the exception of claims based on malice, the action should be struck because it was not commenced within the time limit prescribed in s.2(1)(a) of the PPSA. 3)Limitation of Actions Act provisions provide for a determination of a point of law. Section 579(2) is a procedural provision that permits the Crown to re-commence criminal prosecution during the period following the entry of a stay of proceedings without the necessity of laying new Information or preferring a new indictment. There was no admissible evidence to establish that this action was doomed to fail.  3)The statement of claim was not restricted to events prior to the entering of a limitation period but to those which speak of subsequent conduct by at least some of the defendants. It was arguable that the limitation period began to run 1 year after the commencement of proceedings. 4)With respect to the last issue, the Court of Appeal held that it was improper to dismiss the claim simply on the basis of the passage of time. The Act does not alter the substantive rights of the parties to proceed with matter previously stayed."
b_1996canlii5058.txt,"The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act. The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David. First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity. When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate. Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application. The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.  1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable. 3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.  4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable. The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due. Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas. The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment. Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due. 5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose. It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances. DISSENT: The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date. The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation. There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.","Whether money owed under a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) is debt 'accruing due' under s. 5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act or subject to garnishment cannot be determined by reference only to garnishability of promissory notes not yet due. Other cases pertaining to similar debts must also be rationalized. Here, the conditional nature of the debt under the GIC was not a conditional one and therefore not garnishable."
e_2007skqb174.txt,"The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","HELD: The court held that it would not be in the child's best interests for the father to move with the child to the Yukon as he had failed to abide by the terms of his original custody judgment and refused to provide the mother with any information as to the location of herself or the child since the date of the original judgment. The evidence at trial confirmed each of the seven points outlined by the father in support of the child: 1) a material change in the circumstances when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties, which would be necessary for joint custody, was possible; 2) the mother's failure to notify the father as to her whereabouts and prevented the father from exercising the shared parenting which the Original Custody Judgment had ordered; and 3) the evidence of the custodial parent’s reason for moving, only in the exceptional case where it was relevant to that parent”s ability to meet the child”. The court reviewed the seven factors set out in Gordon v. Goertz. Overall, the court found that there was no material change which existed at the time the father was granted sole custody of the Child and that the child had been well cared for by the mother since its return to Saskatoon in 2005. The mother indicated that she would prefer to be closer to her family in Whitehorse. The father had taken the child out of Saskatoon and moved with him to Whitehorse because he felt he could increase his income in the city, which was more remote and with fewer transportation options than Saskatoon, such that there would be more difficulty for the child in finding employment and staying in the community he had come to know."
9_2004skqb324.txt,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","Walgreens applied for an order quashing two orders of the Board made pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing them. The orders required Wal-Mart to discover and produce documents, including those referred to in a subpoena duces tecum. The order also required that the Board produce documents that are irrelevant to the issues before the Board. The Board conceded that two exceptions to the general rule that error of law must appear on the face of the record were that it had not addressed the relevancy requirement in its decision to authorize the applicant to discover documents or to conduct an examination for discovery by means of subpoenas tecum or a series of production orders. HELD: A review of the transcript is essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and to consider each aspect of the breach of Charter allegations. Counsel for the Board acknowledged the limited role it had on judicial review of one of its orders as outlined in CAIMAW v. Paccar of Canada Ltd., 1989 CanLII 49 (SCC), [1989] S.C.R. 983. It is also significant that counsel for the board concedes that the case before them is unique and that the Court must make an exception to the strict rule that it adopt pragmatic and functional analysis in determining the applicable standard of review. The issue is whether the legislature intended the question to be left to the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribunal. Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) is an example of this. The portions of the first affidavit are rampant with opinion and argument. These portions would normally have been struck. However, the Board did not address them in order to get on with the hearing. It declined to comment on the offending provisions."
b_1996canlii5628.txt,"The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years. As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation. The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages. He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages. Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months. Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified. Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears. Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had.","The sales agent for Allstate was terminated as a result of a two-year, non-competition clause in his employment contract which provided for monthly compensation based on the net written premium on new policies written during the previous month together with renewal compensation calculated by reference to the net premium on renewal policies recorded in the terminated employee's account during the two production quarters preceding that particular month. Allstate sought to justify the termination on the basis of cause, but alleged that this did not constitute a failure by the employee to mitigate his damages. Awarding 20 months salary, as damages in the amount of $1,800 to $3,000 per month, that the employee did not pursue the possibility of alternative employment with enthusiasm or commitment and, as a consequence, had not been compensated during his period of employment with the defendant. The defendant rejected the argument that there was no month for which the plaintiff had not received pro-rated amount to November 5, 1991, when Allstate informed the plaintiff's employment contract with Allstate that no further conversions to the Neighbourhood Office Program status or the new compensation contract would be available to agents on staff prior to the introduction of these programs. Rather, the termination of the contract had no effect on the employee's efforts to seek alternative employment."
4_2010nssc85.txt,"The parties were separated and had difficulty communicating. They were together for eight years, and had two children (ages six and three). The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50). She alleged the husband was abusive. The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children. Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times). The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded. If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that. Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan. Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation. A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance. Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.","The parties were in a relationship for approximately thirty years. They had two children, ages 18 and 18. The wife requested an equal time shared parenting arrangement and alleged that the husband was abusive of her. The parties had little face to face communication and the wife frequently did not respond to the husband's reasonable requests involving the children. The children were placed in the wife's sole care and custody. The husband requested that the children primarily be parented by the wife and that she be more involved with the children's education and activities. HELD: The court found that the parties were unable, at this stage in their relationship, to meet the basic requirements for successful shared parenting. While shared parenting is appropriate for the children, it does not necessarily mean joint custody is in the best interest of them. The evidence showed that the wife was frustrated and not able to participate in the parenting process. Although the parties appeared to parent co-operatively, there was a serious issue of conflict between the parties that could be addressed by a joint custodial arrangement. The court referred to this issue in Kruger v. Farnell (2001), where the Court found that both parties were experiencing difficulty in communicating with each other and that the nature and cause of conflict among the parties was one of the factors that created the need for a shared custody arrangement. Children do benefit from joint decision making because they will have the benefit of the expedience, knowledge and analysis provided by each of their parents. However, an appropriate consideration of each parental viewpoint may not occur if there is a power imbalance. These parents do not live reasonably close to one another and have to pursue counseling to learn how to disengage from arguments and how to manage their frustration and anger."

The hotel was convicted on one charge and the remaining charges were held in abeyance pending its appeal. The hotel sought an order staying the hearing scheduled by the Commission to review a decision of the Authority suspending the applicant's tavern permit for three days, pending disposal of the criminal charges. Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The second ground raised a substantive issue and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth. There was nothing inconsistent with the Commission considering a form of disqualification of the applicant's license or permit, while the state exercises its criminal law power with respect to the same set of facts. 2)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence.

The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing would not result in any new facts that were not already known to it. 2)The Commission was not relying on conviction. It will have the onus of adducing evidence related to the alleged breaches of s. 112(1) of the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act, and presumably the defence will consist of denying one or more of the elements implicit in the allegations. 3)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence if the Commissionhearing was allowed to take place as scheduled."
e_2008skqb84.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred. There was no unfairness in the trial process. The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant. He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer. 2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant. The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case. He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen. The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v. Romanowicz (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.).",HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court found that the appellant had not suffered a miscarriage of justice as a result of his non-lawyer agent’s ineffective assistance in the conduct of the trial. The matter was remitted to a jury to determine whether the appellant should have taken the position that he was entitled to representation by his own counsel. The fresh evidence was not directed to a factual issue decided by the trial judge but rather to obtaining an original remedy from this Court on the basis that the agent”s ineffectual assistance resulted in a miscarriageof justice. The law in this area was well established and there was little reason to embark on further analysis of the fresh evidence before the Court.

The applicant argued that she never received any notice of proceedings making it impossible for her to appeal within 30 days. HELD: Preliminary objection dismissed.

e_2006nssc364.txt,"The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter. The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages. The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed. The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle.","The plaintiff, who was pursuing a shoplifter, was run down in a cross walk in a mall parking lot by the van that was being used as the getaway vehicle in the shoplifting heist. The plaintiff had insurance from his employer, ING, under his Section (uninsured motorist) coverage. When he returned to live in the mall, he sought to register ownership of another vehicle with the Registry of Motor Vehicles. His unsuccessful attempt was refused because the public record still showed he was the registered owner of the vehicle that had been involved in the hit and run incident. HELD: The plaintiff's evidence was replete with inconsistencies, contradictions, admitted poor memory and admitted lies in his earlier discovery evidence. The Court was unable to locate either of them.  1) The plaintiff acknowledged that he sold the van to a woman he had just picked up and wanted to exchange for drugs. He said he did not recall the date of the sale but that he recognized it by the distinguishing features earlier mentioned and promptly called the police to pass on its location and license number. 2) The only clear evidence before the court on the identity of the van is that of the plaintiff himself. His first instinct was to look at the rear of the escaping van for any distinguishing features. What he saw was a grey cargo van with a shabby paint job, heavily tinted rear windows and post light mounted just above the left rear bumper. He also said that the engine was smoking and burning oil at the time but he could not discern the license plate identification or even whether a license plate was on the vehicle at all. It was clear that the van was not in driveable condition. 3) There were a number of inconsistencies in the plaintiff's testimony, most of which related to the issues in this case to be decided. It is pertinent to note that the plaintiff was not the only witness who testified that he was struck by the vehicle but that his lawyer prepared a Statutory Declaration to show him that he had sold the vehicle to the woman who had helped him move to a new apartment and that he could see the driver sitting in the driver's seat with the motor running. He did not recognize the driver from the police photo line up entered in evidence as part of the police investigation file and did not allow or authorize a person named Charles Burke (or any other person besides Ms. Marsh) to drive his vehicle. 4) Although the Court was able to locate both of them, there were a few inconsistencies."

At the onset of her trial, the accused took the position that her s. 8, s. 9 and s. 10 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all the evidence obtained after the stop should be excluded. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached. 1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest. 2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there. 3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.","HELD: The accused was found guilty of all counts. The court found that the accused's s. 8, 9 and 10 Charter rights were infringed and that all evidence obtained after the initial stop should be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. There were more than enough incidents of violence to police officers when vehicles have been stopped.

4_1996canlii6648.txt,The applicant sought to have the law firm barred from acting for the plaintiff because a member of that firm had been active in representing the defendant prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers following a change in government. This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors. The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause. 1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff. This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.  2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern. 4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme. It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists. Also such policies may well have changed since 1992.,"The applicant sought to have a solicitor be barred from acting for the plaintiff by reason of a conflict of interest. The solicitor had been active in representing the defendant Crown corporation prior to 1991 when the defendant changed solicitors. This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the contractual issues giving rise to the cause of action were ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitor. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The applicant was being consistent with a prior ruling involving a asimilar attempt to displace the solicitor's present solicitors from certain litigation then existing following the 1982 change of government. 2)The solicitor was not a member of that firm and had not been involved in any of the contractual matters before 1991. As the plaintiff had no direct knowledge of the subject matter of the action, the onus to establish the existence of confidential information justifying the requested order shifted to the party asserting the concern. 3)Much is made by the applicant of the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. By such reference to strategy counsel it seems to suggest that the company has such a strategy and internal policies and procedures that could not be deduced from the pleadings and examinations for discovery by any competent lawyer. 4)The only identifiable strategy adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications, including this one, to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation."
b_2008skpc104.txt,"The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act. There was a complaint to police concerning the accused. He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment. He smelled of alcohol. He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police. Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol. He was causing a disturbance to others. Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place. No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused. The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication. The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go. In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest.

2_2011nsca89.txt,"The defendant, who was in a very small apartment with two other individuals, got up from the couch and proceeded through a doorway behind the complainant, purportedly to use the bathroom. A few minutes later, the complainant found something wrapped around his neck and he was choked until he passed out. When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him. She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back. The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat. Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door. Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay. When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked. She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. Appeal dismissed;  it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility. Although he did not specifically refer to the principles in R. v. Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence. The complainant never wavered in his evidence that the other individual had never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat, which was supported by the other individual's testimony.","The appellant appealed her conviction for robbery alleging error by the trial judge in his assessment of credibility.

HELD: Appeal dismissed. The court found no error in his conclusion that the appellant's culpability for the robbery and the assault had been established beyond reasonable doubt.[1] The appellant took the stand in her own defence. She admitted that at the time of this offence she was on parole. She knew that if she were convicted, her parole would be revoked.

The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions. The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation. The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation. The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions. The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court. The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants. The court dismissed the motion.",The plaintiffs brought a motion to consolidate their claim against the defendants with three other named actions. All four defendants were originally seeking consolidation of an action involving the same defendants and allegations of negligent management with each plaintiff during an overlapping period of time. The motion was dismissed with the exception that the matters be heard together (pursuant to Rule 37.02 of the Rules) because there was little evidence available to assess the degree of overlap in the evidence to be heard on behalf of each plaintiff.  There was also no evidence before the Court to determine whether the proposed trials should be heard individually or in sequence.

They commenced this proposed class action against the Attorney General of Canada (the Government) in December 2005. In January 2007 the plaintiffs' counsel filed an amended statement of claim which added the Government of Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan) as a second defendant. Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim. The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents.

The pleadings indicated that the plaintiffs were alive to the possibility of some of their claims being statute barred. They asked the court to extend the time for commencing the action on a nunc pro tunc basis.
6_2013skca2.txt,"The Crown applied for leave to appeal a Queen's Bench decision that set aside the convictions of the respondents, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. and its sole director, Varga, for operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s. 18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act. The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga. The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands. The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages. In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act. HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1. As the Provincial Court judge's conclusion was correct, the Court held that the convictions must stand and did not interfere with the fines and surcharges imposed upon the respondents.","The petitioner manufactures log-home packages near Weyakwin, under the direction of Garry Varga, the sole director of the company. As a result of what the manufacture of these packages entails, both the company and Varga were convicted in Provincial Court of operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s.18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act, S.S. 1996. In consequence, each was fined and ordered to pay a surcharge. The Attorney General applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for leave to appeal on the grounds the judge misconstrued the licensing provisions of the Act and hence misapplied them. HELD: Appeal allowed. The convictions must stand. The matter need not have been taken up in the context of this case, at least not in the extent and to the effect the judge of Queen’s Bench thought appropriate. The fines and surcharges are nothing in the case to suggest we might interfere with the decision of the trial judge, so they stand."
c_2013skca113.txt,"HELD: The applicant’s first two grounds of appeal related to the evidence of the respondents’ and police. The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that questions of evidence were of sufficient importance to grant leave. The applicant’s third ground was that the Chambers judge failed to take into account the interests of the public, particularly, the need to deter the public and the need to remove profit from crime to compensate victims. The Court of Appeal did not grant leave on the third ground. The Chambers judge reviewed the relevant case law and did not fail to take those items into account. The last ground of appeal was the fact that the vehicle had already been held for 90 days. The Court of Appeal said that this ground did raise some interest but they were not convinced that this was the case to grant the leave to appeal.","The Director of the Director's application for the forfeiture of a vehicle registered to the respondent was brought pursuant to s. of the Act on the ground that the vehicle had been used in criminal activity. The vehicle in question is a 2010 Ford Transit Cargo Van. The Director purchased it in 2010 with money received from her father's estate. Beginning in January of 2013, she and the respondent used it to haul items on an on-call basis. They entered the compound through a hole in the fence and returned to the Vehicle with two pails full of copper wire. In March of 2012, the accused was seen removing copper material from the back of a truck. He was found in the vehicle with rolls of copper in his arms. When the driver threatened to call the police, the parties and the accused fled. The accused were convicted of theft under $5,000 and one count of break and enter. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1) With respect to issues (a) and (b), the Director was not at all sure that the Chambers judge overlooked the interests of the public or failed to consider the need to deter crime, undercut the profitability of crime or so forth. He conducted a relatively thorough review of the case law in the course of establishing the framework governing his decision-making process. This included Saskatchewan (Director, Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009) v. Mihalyko, 2009. 2) The Director had raised a point of some interest but was not persuaded that, in the context of this case, questions of evidence are of sufficient importance to engage the Court."
5_1999canlii12498.txt,The applicant sustained a lower back injury in an automobile accident in February 1995 which resolved within ten days to two weeks. In June 1995 he began to experience pain in his back which slowly worsened until he was hospitalized in October 1995. He was diagnosed with a large central and right sided disc herniation. SGI denied his claim for income replacement benefits as a non-earner under s.117(1) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. In issue was whether the accident caused the disc herniation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The plaintiff had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities. Two family physicians supported his contention but the medical director of rehabilitation services for SGI and the orthopaedic surgeon who treated the applicant were both of the opinion the herniation was not caused by the accident.,"An application under Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for income replacement benefits contending that the accident caused the disc herniation. The respondent, Saskatchewan Government Insurance denied the claim for benefits. The applicant applied to the respondent for review of its decision and appealed to the Court pursuant to s. 197. HELD: The application was dismissed. There was no doubt that for a period of time after the disc hersiation, the non-earner was unable to hold the employment he could have held at the time of the accident and would be entitled to an income replacement benefit if the heriation was caused by the accident. The onus is on the applicant to establish his claim to the benefits on a balance of probabilities. His appeal is dismissed."
d_2017skpc77.txt,"HELD: The accused was not guilty of either charge. Although the accused was lawfully stopped, the roadside demand was valid and the accused declined to exercise his right to counsel on two occasions following his arrest, the observation period at the detachment was not conducted properly. The officer was sometimes focused on other things. As the observation period comprised part and parcel of a breath test, the breathalyzer test was not properly administered and the Crown could not rely on the accuracy of the readings.","HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2, over.08. The Crown cannot rely on the presumption of accuracy in s. 258(1)(c) of the Criminal Code. The evidence does not support a finding of guilt on count #1. The observation period at the detachment was properly conducted. The police officer never saw the accused put anything in his mouth; he never heard the accused burp or belch; and he was in close proximity to the accused. Both samples were 100 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, and the breathalyzer instrument did not detect any mouth alcohol. The accused indicated that he understood his right to counsel but that he did not wish to call lawyer."
b_1997canlii11437.txt,"A month following the birth of the plaintiff's only child by caesarian section, she underwent a hysterectomy on an emergency basis. She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her. The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics. 2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part. The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix. Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted. The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage. ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4: The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes.","The plaintiff gave birth to a healthy baby girl on August 25, 1992. She was admitted to the Victoria Union Hospital by ambulance as a result of the sudden onset of profuse vaginalbleeding. The defendant, who had performed the caesarian section delivery operation, was called in to attend to the plaintiff's needs. The plaintiff alleges that the hysterectomy, which was not performed, was negligent in the performance of his professional duties and services upon her with the result that the hemorrhage became inevitable. Central to the defendant's allegations of negligence is that the likely cause of the ongoing or recurring bleeding was the retained products of conception, which the surgeon failed to remove from her uterus by a dilation and curettage procedure. HELD: 1)The surgical care and surgical care of the plaintiff was to be the primary source of the bleeding. 2)Given the large number of medical and hospital records pertaining to this case, the court could not in no way preclude a party wishing to challenge the accuracy of the records or entries from doing so. 3)The hospital records, including the nurses' notes made contemporaneously by someone having personal knowledge of the matters then being recorded and under a duty to make the entry or record, should be received in evidence as prima facie proof of the facts stated therein. These records should be entitled to the same standard of care as the records. 4)The plaintiff was awarded judgment for irretrievable loss and for the pain and suffering resulting from her treatment and surgery. 5)Costs were awarded in the amount of $50,000."
d_2002skpc138.txt,"The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing. HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples. The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed. The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer. Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition. He should not drink and drive.","The accused, a 28 year member of the RCMP, failed to comply with a demand made to him by a Peace Officer pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code requiring him to provide then or a soon thereafter as is practicable such samples of his breath as in the opinion of a qualified technician are necessary to enable a proper analysis to be made in order to determine the concentration, if any, of alcohol in his blood. HELD: The accused was convicted of failure to provide a sample. The Court found that the accused was not diligent in attempting to obtain counsel as he was not aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks and that his breathing was erratic. The accused did not communicate the contents of the message on the answering machine to the police officer thus not allowing the officer to consider a longer waiting period than the 10 minutes he did allow."
b_1996canlii6726.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties. The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division. The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens. The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted. The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production. If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys. A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing. The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act. The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times. On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a). 5)The second and third tests were not met. The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value. It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do. If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent. There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan. The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued.","FIAT The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from certain oil production properties, those proceeds now being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta, and a further order preservingand detaining all future production proceeds from those properties. HELD: 1)The applicants failed to meet the first test of a prima facie case, the irreparable harm which could only be alleviated by requiring positive steps at the interlocutory stage, such an order was appropriate.  2)The court must be careful to see that the defendant knows exactly what he has to do and this means not as a matter of law but as matter of fact. 3)If the applicants are required to pay full compensation, they must also demonstrate that they have a strong probability that grave damage will accrue to him in the future. 4)The Court must also consider the factors to be considered in the third test, which is whether the applicants have met the requirements set out in s.33 of the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (the BLA) or if they have not. 5)The issue here is not whether the properties are declining in value, but whether this decline in value will occur at such a rapid rate as to rob the applicants of the fruits of potentially successful litigation, and therefor cause them irreparable damage. These are the test results of the BLA. The applicants must demonstrate that the Crown's willingness to wield its statutory powers under the O&G to ensure these environmental obligations are met. If these liens are substantially the same as those of all the claimants, then whatever prima-facie case they might otherwise have is weakened by this confusion."
7_2016skpc104.txt,"Criminal Law – Evidence – CredibilityCriminal Law – Evidence – Expert Evidence – Blood Alcohol ConcentrationCriminal Law – Impaired Driving – Blood Alcohol Level Exceeding .08 The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)). As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours. When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off. The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house. The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD. He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired. He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him. He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples. The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal. The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving. The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes. The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45. An alcohol expert and the accused testified. The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to. The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007. HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence. The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis. The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions. The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping. There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face. The accused was found guilty of the evading charge.","The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol (under s. 253(1)(a) and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08) and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer. HELD: The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was impaired. The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving was over 80 mg% and his level of intoxication was borderline. The Court accepted the evidence of alcohol expert Mary Ellen Scott and the accused's contention that he was not trying to evade this police officer. The issue was whether there was a reasonable excuse for not stopping (i.e. because the accused said he wanted to reach his driveway where he would not have his truck seized by the officer and that this factor, taken together with the time since this day, has effected his recollection of this day and what he drank.  1) The accused was found not guilty on the impaired driving charge (count 1), on the over.08 charge and on the charge of failure to stop (breath demand) and, in the case of the one witness who testified that he had been drinking alcohol throughout the day and that he did not want to get away from the officer when he turned on his emergency lights, but was concerned about losing his licence and having his vehicle seized by virtue of the officer's powers under the Traffic Safety Act.  2) The Court was satisfied there was reasonable excuse (i).e. the accused stated that he only had six beer cans on his table when he got out of his vehicle. The officer did not specifically count the beer cans and put them in his notes. The ASD test was required to give him the grounds to make an Intoxilyzer demand. 3) There was no doubt the accused attempted to escape the police officer (Cst. Cobbledick in his vehicle, after receiving his rights to counsel and the police warning, but did not mention any consumption of vodka or hard liquor. He read the breath demand to him at 3:03 a.m. He then drove him back to Kamsack, where he provided samples of his breath of 110 mg% in the morning and 100 mg% at night. While he said he was drinking alcohol that evening and night, he also denied he was trying to avoid the officer(s) when he stopped for him; rather he was just trying to make it back to his driveway as he believed this would"
2_2011nssc500.txt,"The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction. After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building. Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand. The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged. A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket. Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level. The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall. Accused found guilty on both counts; the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation. Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.","The accused was charged with two counts under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and one count of possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. The police observed the transaction from an observation post less than 130 feet from the incident and from a position of some elevation. Constable Marriott had the use of expensive binoculars to view the encounter. The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused stashed the drugs in the rock wall after the transaction and did so minutes before his arrest. The accused denied having control of the drugs and said they were not accessible to any other individual but to him. The Crown argued that the presence of a large plastic baggy with a small plastic bag in it could be seen by the Court as the accused gestured to another place to avoid detection. The defence argued that this was not a common practice in street level drug trafficking and the evidence gathered at the trial did not support that conclusion. Awarding the accused $50,000 for the offence, that the transaction was constructive, done knowingly by the accused for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The court rejected the Crown's argument that the stash location was public and that it could not easily be seen one foot off the ground in the corner of the building, but Constable Marriott’s evidence concerning what he observed of the drug transaction was reasonable and consistent with drug trafficking practices."
5_2013skqb237.txt,"The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety. There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop. The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device. The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer. At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood. A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings. A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them. The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused. The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook. The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one. The accused did not recall this waiver. The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty. The accused's readings were .11 and .04. The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results. HELD: The appeal was not successful. Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b). The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure. The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned. The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective. The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached. The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(1)(a) the Criminal Code and driving with a blood alcohol content over.08. The accused had consumed four or five drinks. There was no other observable signs of impairment. The officer asked the accused to enter the police vehicle where he asked him to provide a sample of his breath into an approved screening device. When the accused complied, the instrument registered failure. As result, the accused was arrested for impaired driving and read his right to counsel as follows: You have the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. Legal Aid duty counsel is available to provide you with immediate legal advice if you have a reasonable opportunity to do so. The police officer did not turn to the accused in an attempt to reduce the number of names. There really is no similarity between the name 'Vaughn' and 'Vagnan'. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The trial judge addressed the factors and correctly applied the test. As there was no error, the court took comfort in the fact that patterns emerge with respect to particular types of evidence. 2) The exclusion of the certificate, and any evidence as to breath samples given by the accused, all being subsequent to the Charter 10(b) breach is the proper remedy. Where the trial judge has considered the proper factors, appellate courts should accord considerable deference to his or her ultimate determination."
9_2009skqb313.txt,"The appellant appeals a demolition order pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act issued against his property. Issues on appeal was whether the board erred by considering material which had not been before city council, whether the board committed a jurisdictional error by failing to disclose evidence to the appellant prior to considering the appeal, and whether the board was biased against the appellant. HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds. The board's order is confirmed. Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of 6 months from the date of this court order. The applicant is granted a 6 month period to remedy the problems identified. 1) The board complied with the directions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure had been made to the appellant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. The board has ensured that the appellant knew the case he had to meet. No error of law has been committed. 2) The appellant had all the information considered by the board disclosed to him. 3) There is no evidence of bias. Oppositely, the evidence supports the board's conclusion that the situation in the building constituted a nuisance related to the activities around the building, including the safety of the residents and surrounding neighbours. There is no evidence of bias against the appellant personally.",The registered owner of the property applies for an order of vacate and demolish to allow him to remedy his problems with the building. The building inspector at the time of issuing the demolition order had not received complete disclosure of the case he had to meet as the earlier complaints had not led to the order. The inspector now seeks leave from the Court to launch an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act. The board has complied with the direction of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure has been made to the applicant regarding relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The board's order is confirmed. It is not appropriate to restrict either party in putting forward evidence which they consider relevant on these questions. 2) There is no error of law. The Board acted in a reasonable and prudent manner in confirming the November 2004 demolition order. 3) It would be appropriate for the applicant to seek the assistance of a third party to remedy the underlying problems. The third party will be given a period of 6 months from the date of the decision to bring forth his written proposal as outlined in the board's decision.
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","The Director applied under the Seizure of Criminal Property Act for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 of property to the Crown in Saskatchewan. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from William Ross Butler in 2008. Since the plaintiff filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order pursuant to Part II.1. HELD: The Director's application was granted.  1)The legislation is civil not criminal in nature and it is not intended to be a retroactive remedy. 2)There is no retroactivity problem. The evidence on when the Director 'became satisfied' the seized property constituted proceeds of unlawful activity is found in the Affidavit of Tammy Pryznyk sworn December 15, 2016. The Defence counsel did not challenge the Director's qualifications as an expert nor was voir dire sought for such purposes.  3)In accordance with the language adopted by the Legislature for s.35.1, no application or administrative forfeiture proceeding pursuant to the 2009 Act may be commenced after two years from the date of seizure as contended by the Director. The date of discovery is irrelevant as is the need for a finding of criminal culpability. 4)The Director's argument largely focusses on the individual charged with the criminal offence as opposed to the property derived from unlawful activity. 5)Once a property is acquired prior to the coming into force of a statute, it can be said legislation receives retroactive application when the effect of applying it to particular facts is to deem the law to have been different from what it actually was. The legislation is not made expressly retroactive."
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT. The father of one child applied to reduce his child support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under an order of Archambault J. dated March 6, 1996. In his last full year with Ipsco, being the 2000 taxation year, Mr. Pilat's gross annual income was the sum of $52,377. HELD: 1) On all of the evidence it is the father's choice to work a minimum amount each year and, if he should return to school, it will be his choice to attend school and severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. It has been said in number of cases that individuals who are subject to support obligations are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to all the circumstances. These circumstances include the age, education, experience, skills, historical earning capacity and health of the payor; the standard of living experienced during marriage; the availability of work; the payors freedom to relocate; the reasonableness of the career aspirations and the motives behind them, as well as any other obligations of a payor. 2) The father was underemployed. He had not obtained full-time employment with another employer. He has continued to work seasonally as guide for Great Plains Outfitters and has received employment insurance benefits to supplement his income in the 2001, 2002 and 2003 taxation years. 3) The mother requested costs as against against the father for the additional legal expenses associated with having to submit motions to the Court in order to force the father to disclose financial information.  4) Costs were awarded to the mother in the amount of $750."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","This was an appeal from an order of Barclay J. which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the labour Relations Board, and even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs in the usual way. 1)Section 5.3 both confers and limits the jurisdiction of the Board to make interim orders. The question decided by the Board, that it had Power to make the order in question, was clearly a jurisdictional question and so treated it. Accordingly the standard of review is whether the decision was correct, rather than whether it was patently unreasonable. 2)The ordinary meaning of the words of s.5.3 require two conditions for the exercise of the power: the existence of an application or complaint before the board, andthe existence of power in the labour board to make final order in respect of the application. The section contains no words directly limiting the terms 'application or complaint' and 'final order or decision' in s. 5.4. The Board recognized it to be a jurisdiction question and treated it accordingly. The chambers judge arrived at a correct conclusion."

In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial. The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify.

The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend. An adjournment was granted. The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction. Dismissing the application. It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code. Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion. If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ. In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment.

The husband had declared personal bankruptcy since the date of the original orders obtained under the Matrimonial Property Act and Divorce Act. HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to pay maintenance was reduced to $1 per month and the arrears accruing after the date of his assignment into bankruptcy were cancelled.  2)The wife's counsel requested that the court value and divide all of the matrimonial property equally notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because she might pursue a constructive trust claim for her 1/2 share as against the husband's trustee. 3)The court valued all of the matrimonial property and determined that 56% of this value should be paid to the wife, and only 44% to the husband, given amounts he had spent since the separation.  4)The court left unresolved the issue of which matrimonial assets might be exempt under the Bankruptcy Act and therefore available to the wife.","In November 1993 following a trial involving the divorce of the parties, including corollary relief on such questions as spousal maintenance and division of matrimonial property, a division of the property was held. At issue was whether the husband should resume livestock operation on the farm. HELD: 1)The petitioner did pay $2,300 by way of maintenance out of the proceeds of certain barley he sold privately. The respondent claims this was in violation of my original order prohibiting the sale of any assets without consent of the other party or the Court. 2)The wife was entitled to the following set-off: $1,082 for car payments, $300 to legal fees, $1k100 to obtain a Class truck driver's license and the balance to live on.  3)The respondent's claim for set off was allowed since he did not take up farming and his subsequent decision to assign into bankruptcy makes the calculation of what each hopes to recover from the marriage assets problematic at best. Some assets such as the remaining farm lands were clearly exempt although even there it was not possible to say how much would be left to divide between the parties after payment of the current encumbrances on the title. However, one half of the net proceeds to the wife were to be divided based on the value of the farm lands, the parties equity in Saskatchewan Wheat Pool and grain on hand would normally go to satisfy the unsecured creditors of the respondent under his bankruptcy. 4)Each side was to bear their own costs.Division of property was to be based on asset values at this stage problematical and indeed by including some assets which may not be exempt in whole or in part from the bankruptcy proceedings."

The 38 year old had 49 prior convictions. The sentencing judge noted the accused's 3.5 years of sobriety, community support, education and technical trade training, and positive pre-sentence report but failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all, protection of the public. The respondent had no sooner finished parole than he began to commit these crimes.","The Crown appeals a conditional sentence of two years less one-day imposed on the respondent after he pled guilty to the following charges. The Crown appeals conditional sentences of 2 years less 1 day imposed. HELD: 1) The sentence was reduced to 2 years for theft which was obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to s. 355(b) of the Criminal Code; 2) The community disposition was likely to be more effective than incarceration at rehabilitating the respondent. 3) The respondent was 38 years old with 49 prior convictions. The sentencing judge had a negative pre-sentence report and the respondent spent time on remand.

SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply. Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT.

HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was entitled to one set of costs in any event of the application. 1)There were appropriate circumstances in Thole v. McKenna (1988), 36 C.P.C. 159 (Q.B.) for the Court to direct security to the plaintiffs. 2)The defendant had not proceeded with an application at an earlier stage of the proceedings as it wished to provide an opportunity at the pre-trial conference stage for the matter to be resolved. 3)The Court was not in a position to direct the award of security for costs at this stage. The time to bring the application was at least soon after September 1996. The fact that it was not made until now would have left the plaintiffs with the distinct possibility that, ultimately, the court was not going to be asked by SaskPower to have them furnish security. 4)There are appropriate circumstances, per Grotsky J., to deny the defendant an order that the plaintiffs post security in the present instance against either of the plaintiffs even if accept that their claims are joint. In the exercise of my discretionary jurisdiction, the Court would dismiss SaskPower's motion. 5)In the case of joint claims, all of the claims to which was party were joint were joint and therefore security could not be ordered."

The board of revision was directed to hear and determine the assessment appeal. 1)The Committee did not err in deciding the prescribed time period for an appeal could not be extended.  2)The less formal expression 'to give notice to' as used in the Act is a less exacting term than 'to serve notice upon'.

HELD: The appeal from the decision of the Committee will be allowed with costs as usual and there will be an order directing the board to hear and determine the company's appeal. 1)The phrase'may give notice in writing' must be taken by implication to allow for notice to be given by means of registered mail. This is a less formal expression suggesting a less exacting term. Moreover, it is an Act of such commonplace application as to strongly suggest notice might be given via registered mail, applying as it does to almost everyone in every corner of the rural areas of the Province, and falling as it did to be applied by local people with no special training, except for the administrators. 2)Wascana Energy exercised its right to appeal properly or effectively. This was a case where nothing turned on the fact the notice did not arrive a day or two earlier, for the administrator and the board were still able to act upon it in accordance with the requirements of the legislation.  3)The appeal could only be entertained by a person who posts written notice in approved form by registered mail prior to the expiration of the 20 day appeal period. 4)The delay in the appeal process was minor and did not affect the administration of the appeal. 5)It was impossible to think that the legislature intended that the word give as importing the necessity of receipt would have a fatal effect such as that of nullifying the act of service or the notice of intention to appeal or both, and that the board would have had to deal with this matter as a whole."

In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible.

Herzberg was charged with impaired driving, driving with a blood-alcohol level exceeding.08 and dangerous driving.

The application was dismissed. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the matter is remitted to Provincial Court for trial. 1)There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court, whether composed of a judge and jury or a jury alone, does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. Although it is the presiding judge to ensure a fair hearing, there is no law which guarantees that inadvertent, inadmissible evidence will not be introduced. If an error of that nature should occur, the error should be ignored, or, if it is deemed too significant to be ignored by the judge, a mistrial will be declared. 2)The respondent was correct to dismiss the application for stay and to decline to recuse herself.  3)Every individual charged with a criminal offence is guaranteed the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal."

The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit. The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of. HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted. The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party. There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer. There is a causal connection between the cause of action plead in the statement of claim and the third party notice.

The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage to a construction site under the Senator Sid Buckwold Bridge caused as result of his truck leaving the surface of the road at the head of the bridge going over the guardrail and falling into the excavation pit. HELD: The application is purely one of procedure and no substantive rights between the parties can be determined on it. It is not proper to assess evidence or to go into possible defences. The Court reviewed the case of Bucsis v. Rocy and concluded that there was no prejudice to the plaintiff if the Third Party Claim was grafted onto the plaintiff's action. Therefore the application is granted as requested.  1) It is incumbent upon the Chambers judge to ascertain whether the defendant, Rocy (applicant), has filed material which establishes a prima facie claim against the proposed third party, Future Exteriors Ltd. From the pleadings, it would appear that the third party was a major player in undertaking the work which is the subject of the plaintiffs' loss and claim. 2) To refuse the application under s. of The Contributory negligence act, would likely result in the requirement for a second litigation process to be commenced, that being by the defendants against the alleged third party claiming contributory negligence. This would to large extent create a legal process almost wholly duplicating that which is embodied in the litigation to this stage. Courts have been vigilant to attempt to prevent such duplicate processes where the issue of prejudice could be addressed through direction and order from the Court on the combined process as an alternative."

6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","This appeal concerns the application of s. of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. The main issue relates to how the proceeds of sale of property by judicial listing should be applied against a mortgage balance when there are both purchase money and non-purchase money balances. The appellant relies upon the Court's decision in Andrew (CA) and the clear direction that the sale proceeds be applied to the purchase money portion. The respondent then seeks an order entitling it to the deficiency. Hrynewich Holdings respects the spirit and intent of the LCRA and accords with the policy behind the legislation as set out in this judgment. The parties agree that the right of lender to recover the unpaid balance of mortgage securing the purchase price of farmland is restricted to the land to which the mortgage or agreement relates as well as to any collateral security including a guarantee. The Court also notes that s. 25 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act was not intended to give the mortgagor immunity from liability for the portion of the indebtedness that was not purchase money funds and nothing in the section requires a mortgagee to treat its security as securing pro-rated amounts of the purchase, purchase, and Purchase money portions of the debt."
d_1997canlii11011.txt,"An application to vary the terms of a 1995 consent judgment such that the applicant would have sole custody. Alternatively he sought an order preventing the mother from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The father obtained an ex parte order preventing the mother from removing the child from the province until the return date of the motion. The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994. The father had exercised regular and frequent access. She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties. Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home. HELD: 1)Relocation was neither foreseen nor reasonably contemplated by the judge making the original order. The threshold criteria was thus satisfied. 2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence. The child had a close relationship with both parents. The disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community could not be assessed. 3)The applicant's request for interim relief was denied. If the mother proceeded with her move a revision of the access provision would be appropriate. 4)The child's best interest is the proper test to be applied (Cote) having regard to the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon. 5)The applicant became aware in early June of the mother's intention to move to British Columbia and did not object. The timing of the application, a few weeks prior to the proposed move, raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application.  6)Costs were left to the trial judge.",This was an application to vary the terms of a consent judgment such that the applicant would havesole custody of his daughter from the Province of Saskatchewan. In the alternative the applicant sought an order preventing the respondent from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The parties separated in October 1994 and the daughter had been in the care of their mother since that time. The mother had been a stay-at-home mom and raised the daughter with the respondent. She had indicated in her notice of motion that she intended to move to Kelowna to enroll the child in a Christian private school. HELD: 1)The child had a close relationship with both parents and there was nothing to dispute the mother's claim that she was prepared to allow the child to move back in with her if she chose to return to Regina. The timing of the application raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application.  2)The threshold criteria are satisfied. The threshold is met and the court is then required to embark on a fresh inquiry into what is in the best interests of the child. This is not in dispute that the respondent exercised regular and frequent access. There is nothing to question the applicant's claim to a closer relationship with his daughter and relationship with her extended family. 3)The court is not able to say that relocation was either foreseen or would have beenreasonably contemplated by the judge who made the initial order. 4)In this case the court was unable to assess the effect of a disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal from the community.
3_1998canlii1847.txt,"The Workers' Compensation Board applied, by way of stated case, to have the Court answer questions with respect to the interpretation of certain provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act. There were 40 questions in total. The Court was asked to relate the questions to 19 factual summaries presented by the Board concerning cases before it. The Court was required to decide whether the questions were the proper subject matter of a stated case. Dismissing the stated case application, that the questions submitted are hypothetical and speculative. They are therefore inappropriate questions for a stated case, which requires that questions must be responsive to the facts and must not be speculative.","At issue in the trial was whether or not certain provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act, S.N.S. 1994-95 could stifle the incremental development of jurisprudence with respect to claims under that Act. For the respondents, that the stated case procedure was an expeditious method of obtaining judicial opinion as to the correctness in law of certain interlocutory or final decisions or rulings.

8_2001nssc179.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","The plaintiff/defendant sought reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses it incurred for equipment rentals and other activities it claimed were required because of the failure of Roper Ltd. to perform the contract. The defendant counterclaimed for damages arising out of losses it suffered due to delays in the construction of the LBC on the basis that the equipment supplied by the defendant was not the same type and model as it listed in the response to the tender. The contractual obligation to'maintain the banks' was to be construed by the wording in the contract, and any variation in wording between the original invitation for tender and the subsequent invitation for tenders was inconsequential. The plaintiff was awarded the contract by the issuance of a purchase order incorporating the terms and conditions in the tender, the prices bid by the defendants, and as extras for services it performed during the contract for which it had never been paid.  The plaintiff brought this action for reimbursement, and for expenses it claimed to incur due to Roper's failure to perform, the defendant counterclaims for extras for the contract which it was never paid. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement was dismissed. The court found that the defendant did not have to accept the scope of operations in the purchase order as the actual volumes of coal were to be handled during the term of the contract as the estimated volumes were the same estimates as appeared in the bid. The contract was awarded to the defendant, as amended, as the contract between the parties was not subject to the parol evidence rule.  1)Each of the defendants was entitled to a share in the profits the plaintiff earned from the lifting and blending of coal at the VJCPP. 2)Each defendant was also entitled to costs in the amount of $50,000. 3)The plaintiff was required to maintain and service the banks and in order to do this it was necessary to remove snow from the areas in which coal was being banked and areas from which coal were being lifted. In addition to the usual maintenance of banks, the plaintiff was also to arrange its operations to coincide with the schedule of the coal preparation plant and delivery of coal from other sources, as well as the lifting schedule as determined by the Superintendent of Coal Handling. 4)The defendant was to provide the rental of equipment for the lifting of coal by rail. The rental rate applied when equipment was used for purposes other than the maintenance of the equipment itself was not being used. 5)There was no ambiguity as to the nature of the work performed"
8_2010nssc219.txt,"The parties' hostility prevented them from reaching an agreement on interim parenting arrangements for their two-and-a-half-year-old child. There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months). The mother had nothing positive to say about him. They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child. He agreed to abstain from drugs around the child and for 12 hours before access. The mother expressed concern the father was a flight risk because he was from Egypt and had family support outside the country. Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access. The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.",The mother sought to have the father's access supervised. The father had not had contact with the child since January 2010 and was concerned that he would be able to obtain an Egyptian passport for his daughter. The mother had recently moved into her mother's apartment taking the child with her. HELD: 1) The father was not to be under the influence of marijuana while he was caring for the child. The child was at risk of harm if left in his care unsupervised. The only evidence that the father was concerned about threats to harm the child was that he had not seen her in situations where there were peanuts present. 2) The evidence from Veith House did not suggest a real likelihood of the father making the threat. 3) The Father was to attend a course in parenting such as those offered by Family SOS so that he will be better prepared to parent the child in the future. 4) The mother was to take part in a parenting course.
e_1999canlii1479.txt,"The respondent was recruited by the respondents. Her job was to start quality assurance practice. She accepted an offer of employment, giving up her own company to do so. After 15 months she was dismissed. The trial judge in her action for wrongful dismissal and negligent misrepresentation did not find any negligent misrepresentation but awarded damages equivalent to five months notice for wrongful dismissal. The appellant appealed the dismissal of her claim for negligent misrepresentation and the notice period for her wrongful dismissal. The respondent cross-appealed the damage award, claiming the trial judge failed to take into account the appellant's failure to mitigate. Appeal and cross-appeal, that the evidence supports the trial judge's findings, and he did not make any errors in law.","The trial judge found no negligent misrepresentation but awarded damages equivalent to five months notice for wrongful dismissal and also the notice period for the wrongful dismissal. The appellant cross-appealed, claiming the five-month notice period should be reduced due to her failure to mitigate her loss. The trial judge upheld the action against the appellant on the basis that the misrepresentation was not 'negligent' and the term in the contract providing for dismissal on notice was an effective disclaimer precluding any separate action in tort. The Supreme Court confirmed the trial judge's finding that there were misrepresentations by the employer and that they were negligently made. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that the appellant's claim was not based on negligence but on pre-contractual representations concerning the length of time the applicant would be working on the quality assurance practice and that the dismissal was in bad faith. The Court of Appeal reversed the decision and dismissed the action, but set aside the trial judgment in Queen v. Cognos, [1993] 1 S.C.R. (3d) 360. It is not in dispute on the appeal that the Supreme Court of Canada has decided that a partnership is a 'distinct possibility' as defined in the terms of the contract. Rather, it is the reality of the job for which it had been created and passed through the feasibility and costing stage. The contractual provision for termination does not bar an action in a tort manner. There was no palpable or overriding error in determining the appropriate period of notice."
