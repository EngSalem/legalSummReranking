Judge applied the test that the justice of the peace `must be satisfied on reasonable grounds.' Substantial compliance found and warrant upheld.,"The respondent, a justice of the peace, issued a search warrant to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery. The applicants sought an order quashing the warrant on the grounds that the said search warrant was unlawfully and invalidly issued in excess of the jurisdiction of the Respondent for the following reasons: (1) the sole ground upon which the Information was based is hearsay information from a confidential source and no details are provided in support of the informant's opinion or conclusion that such information is reliable; and (2) no reliance could have been placed thereon by the Respondente in determining whether reasonable and probable grounds existed for the issuance of the warrant."
1990canlii2449.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance. The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child. Allowing the appeal, that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act. Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible. It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children. In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born. The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","An unmarried, pregnant, 16 year old applied to the Social Services Department of the City of Halifax for municipal social assistance. She was found to be in need of support as an expectant mother. The applicant's stepfather, who was living with and being supported by her parents, was denied the application. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the Social Planning Department policy in place at the time of her application was not mandatory but rather discretionary. The respondent's stepdad was prepared to provide financial assistance if the applicant was unable to obtain employment, or who was not economically independent. The decision of the Social Security Appeal Board dismissing the appellant's application for certiorari to quash the decision of that board did not apply to the appellant as a person in need as defined by the Municipal Social Assistance Act."
1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The first mortgagee to the project, the second mortgagee, had received a number of irrevocable letters of direction which he acknowledged required him to pay the mortgage brokerage and architectural fees from the two mortgage brokers. The project was financially tight from the very beginning. In early 1986, the first mortgageee, the project accountant, requested that the funds be disbursed contrary to the irrevocables letter of direction dated March 9, 1987. In late 1986, he requested that certain mortgage draws be paid on time, in order to permit sufficient cash flow to the construction project. In the meantime, the plaintiff suppliers and creditors were concerned that the first mortgages would be delayed and that the second mortgages would result in a cash flow problem. The plaintiff submitted these letters of directions in their written representations to the creditors, who were then advised of the potential fluctuation in the proceeds of mortgage advances. The plaintiffs claimed that the solicitor was never in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs nor was he retained by the plaintiffs or purport in any way to act for them or on their behalf. HELD: The first mortgage draw of $78,400 was disbursing funds. The second mortgageee was ordered to pay all future mortgage draws upon the signature of certain individuals only. The third mortgagee was ordered by the court to pay $5,000 in advance to the first two mortgagee and was to be paid in installments of $10,000. The court dismissed the plaintiff's claim under breach of trust. Any claim under a breach of confidence was not allowed."
1994canlii5055.txt,FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel. The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place. He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.,"The accused applied for a review of the terms of his judicial interim release. He and his counsel consented to a judicial interim released order containing certain terms. The accused sought an amendment by adding the phrase'regarding Sgt. Brian Dueck or Carol Bunko-Ruys'. HELD: The application was denied and the existing order stood. The picketing prohibition term imposed by the justice with the consent of the accused was reasonably constituted as a condition of his release from custody. But for this condition the justice might well have ordered that the accused be detained in custody on the ground that there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit a criminal offence if he were not prohibited from picketing prior to his trial.  1)The Court was satisfied in the circumstances and nature of the case that the picketing prohibited term imposed was reasonably justified as acondition of the release of the the accused from custody on a ground that the substantial likelihood he would committed a criminal offense or aninterference with the administration of justice. 2)If the amendment wasgranted as sought by the accused, there still remained a substantial risk he would committing a criminal offences or an interference with the justice system."

The Plaintiff was only 12 at the time. No action was commenced with the result that the original action was now statute-barred. She waited 5 years after she attained the age of majority before taking this action against the Defendants. The Defendants applied to stay the action on the basis that they had never been retained.

An infant 'should not be visited with the sins of the next friends and litigation guardians who preceded him/her in the same action'.,"FIAT. The plaintiff, her mother and the defendants had destroyed their files 5 years after she attained majority before consulting counsel. The plaintiffs had not explained why she waited 5 years, except to say that she did not believe she could do anything as result of the original advice she and her mother received from the judge. The defendants had also destroyed the plaintiff's files. HELD: The application was dismissed and costs were to be paid to the trial judge. 1)The plaintiff's mother was injured in the accident. 2)The plaintiffs' decision to destroy their files did not recognize the contingent element involved in the situation of an infant plaintiff."

He was sentenced to pay a fine of $2,500 or 50 days in default, plus a victim fine surcharge of $250 and three years probation. The terms of the probation order included a direction that the respondent pay restitution to the victims in the amount of $300, that he not have contact with the victims and that he continue treatment with his psychiatrist. The Crown appealed the sentence, alleging that it inadequately reflected the element of deterrence. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge considered the correct principles of sentencing . This was a unique case where it was apparent that the respondent did not commit the offence for the usual reasons and that he required psychiatric treatment.","This was an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed by a Provincial Court judge for a break, enter and theft charge to which the respondent pled guilty. The respondent was sentenced to pay a fine of $2,500 or 50 days in default, plus a victim fine surcharge of $250 and three years probation. The Crown sought to have the sentence retroactive to June 1995. The sentencing judge, however, disagreed with the Crown's arguments regarding the element of deterrence and found the sentence inadequate. He also disallowed the use of a rock to break into a neighbour's house, cutting his hand and dripping blood throughout the house. The appellant obtained full-time employment, obtained employment, and obtained a suspended sentence. He now sought to return to the Armed Forces for another year. The trial judge considered the correct principles of sentencing, which he considered to be the correct foundation of sentencing.

1996canlii6754.txt,"A radio station reported that a 12 year old girl was dragged and sexually assaulted behind a roller rink or between the rink and a store. The owner of the rink claimed financial compensation for a subsequent decline in his business which he alleged was a direct result of the broadcast. The script and reel had been destroyed and it was impossible to recreate exactly what was aired. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing that the defendant published was false, malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. 2)The station followed the CRTC Regulations and was exonerated entirely by its controlling body. The defendant published the news it received from the police, a proven reliable source. 3)Nothing pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff's roller rink operation. The business was on a down side at the time. The assault occurring where it did was not the fault of either party. If it had a bearing on the immediate attendance figure it was minimal and the plaintiff did no promotion whatsoever to increase attendance.","The plaintiff was the announcer for a radio newscast. The plaintiff's employer was the owner of a family corporation and the defendant's radio station reported on the sexual assault. The defendant refused to broadcast the newscasts, saying it was an attempt to ""disrupt"" the public's attention. An eight-week period was observed as the attendance at the defendant station was down for several days. The attendance at that time was recorded by the defendant at his premises and then destroyed. The defendants lawyer brought an action against the plaintiff for loss of profits and lost profits. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded costs of the action. 1)The defendant published the news that it received from the police, the general public and the insurance companies. Nothing was said to the plaintiff that was proven false, malicious, dishonest, dishonest or recklessly published. 2)The plaintiff's evidence was not conclusive. The charts filed as exhibits served more to confuse the issue than to clarify facts in the court's estimation."
1997canlii786.txt,"The parties executed a separation agreement that resolved all matters corollary to their divorce and the Matrimonial Property Act. The respondent husband proceeded with an uncontested divorce. The appellant wife did not oppose the proceeding. She subsequently appealed the corollary relief judgment on the grounds that the underlying separation agreement is unconscionable and unduly harsh. She sought to introduce fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that even with the new evidence, the appellant still failed to demonstrate an adequate excuse for not responding to the divorce proceeding. There was no evidence that the appellant did not understand her legal entitlement at the time the agreements were signed, or that she did not appreciate that a divorce proceeding had been commenced.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children, one of whom was born in the wife's custody and one who was living in the husband's basement. The parties separated in 1996 and the wife moved into the basement of the matrimonial home with the respondent. She was diagnosed as suffering from depression at the time of the separation and had been on medication for depression. The wife had been advised by her doctor that she should take medication for the depression. She underwent an emergency treatment and was hospitalized for several months. The husband and wife separated in 1997. The appellant moved into their basement apartment with the child. The child was later removed from the basement by the respondent's solicitor. The evidence of the wife was found to be relevant and credible. The application to admit fresh evidence was dismissed. The court found that the evidence of a separation agreement was not a sufficient defence to challenge the agreement and was not sufficient to warrant the setting aside of the judgments. The test for admission of fresh evidence in a custody proceeding was not applicable in any event where the parties had entered into a common law relationship and there had been a change in the child's residence and Community Services had become involved with the family."
1997canlii9636.txt,The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.130 of the Land Titles Act and s.56 of the Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act for an order relieving the estate from payment of maintenance ordered in 1972. The respondent objected to the application being brought on behalf of the estate as Olson was neither executrix nor a beneficiary under the Will. The Will had not been admitted to probate. The respondent had divorced testator in 1972 and was granted child support of $60 per month and monthly spousal support of $40. The applicant who cohabited with the deceased since 1978 transferred her home to him in 1980 as joint tenants and he transferred his two and one-half quarter sections of farm land to the applicant. The applicant suggested there was an agreement whereby the respondent lived rent free in the matrimonial home in lieu of support. The respondent received welfare to support herself and the children and had had no funds to pursue enforcement of the unpaid support payments. HELD: 1)The style of cause was amended to show Olson as applicant. She was an interested party within the meaning of s.56 of the EMOA and entitled to bring the application on her own behalf. The respondent was not misled and there was no prejudice. 2)The Land Titles Act was of no assistance to the applicant. The application was to be determined upon s.56 of the EMOA and whether it would be grossly unfair and inequitable to refuse the application. 3)The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge. There was no evidence presented either of consideration being paid nor of what became of the income generated by the land prior to the deceased's death.  4)A trial of an issue was ordered to determine what if any portion of the arrears should remain a charge upon the lands. Some of the evidence conflicted. Viva voce evidence should be heard.,"The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.130 of the Land titles Act S.S. c. L-5 and s.56 of The Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act (EMOA) for an order relieving the respondent Estate (the deceased) from payment of a maintenance order by Johnson J.(as he then was) on November 28, 1972. The decree gave the deceased custody of their two children who were then 10 and and child support of $60 per month. The applicant claimed she received welfare to support herself and the children until 1981. During these years she had no funds with which to hire a lawyer to enforce the support payments which were due to her. HELD: The application failed to be determined upon s. 56 of the EMOA. The question for resolution was whether it would be 'grossly unfair and inequitable' from the applicants perspective to refuse the application and whether such an order can be 'justified' in so far as the respondent is concerned.  1)The applicant presented no evidence of the transfer of the land to her or of what became of the income generated by the land prior to the deceased's death.  2)The respondent was nether the executrix named in the Will nor a beneficiary. 3)The petitioner was entitled to recover arrears of maintenance pursuant to the order of November 29, 1972 but her right to discharge of the order pursuant pursuant to S.56 was denied. 4)The application failed because s.129 of theLand Titles Act is of no assistance to the applicant. This application fails to be resolved upon s.(56) of the Maintenance Order. The issue is whether it is grossly unfair to refuse an application and in so as to the respondent, whether such a order can reasonably be said to be reasonable in so long as the claimant is concerned, whether it can be justified in so much as the Respondent is concerned and whether so an order as to respondent is reasonable. 5)The court should hear evidence viva voce. order the trial of an issue. The respondent will assert her right against a maintenance Order pursuant to sec.56 and assert herRight to discharge the order under s.61 of theEMOA. The costs of this application will be determine by the trial judge."

The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity. He ruled, however, that they could rely on the presumption of accuracy, and placed an onus on the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge committed a fundamental error of law by ruling that when the Crown is forced to rely on the balance of the evidence, the accused must raise a reasonable doubt, a burden that clearly remains on the Crown.","This was an application for leave to appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court of Canada dismissing an appeal from the appellant's conviction under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code.

HELD: 1)The jury may be advised of the prior accident, its date, that proceedings were commenced in this Court and date of those proceedings and that the accident was ultimately settled and the action discontinued. The terms of the settlement and the sum paid were not to be disclosed. Beyond the issue of privilege which was a complete answer to the request, revisiting that action was a more critical problem. The sum paid to settle the first action was not allocated to any head of damages so those issues would have to be transversed as well. 2)The applicant may introduce his prior medical records with respect to the 1985 accident subject to compliance with the usual rules as to notice and admissibility. 3)The statement of claim in that action could not be entered at this trial as it was not evidence.  At best it was a series of allegations made against the prior defendant. The applicant could examine the respondent as to particulars of her claim in the earlier action and refer to material paragraphs. 4)The applicant was restricted to using the respondent's examination for discovery in the prior action for the purpose of cross-examination.  5)Costs were reserved to the trial judge. 6)The previous judge did not intend to reserve his decision with respect to the hearing of this motion and there was no impediment to the matter being reargued and disposed of.","FIAT. The judge reserved his decision with respect to the hearing of the applicant's motion in conjunction with the proposed trial of the action.

The applicant may introduce these records into evidence subject to compliance with the usual rules as to notice and admissibility and the costs of the application. HELD: The terms of the settlement should not be disclosed nor the sum paid to settle the applicant\'s claim.

At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home. Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home. He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98. In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15. HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court. No case law could be found in support of either party. It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.,"FIAT. The parties were married for over 25 years and were now senior citizens. The respondent sought an order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home. The court did not specify a date for the respondent to move from the matrononial home as it was hoped that satisfactory alternate arrangements could be made within reasonable time to avoid the potential of the respondent having to make an interim move to satisfy the time limit in a court order when his preferred accommodations might be available shortly thereafter. HELD: The respondent was granted exclusive possession. The matrimonial home was given to him. 1)The issue resolved around the interpretation of two conflicting rules regarding the execution of a judgment or an order of exclusive possession and the possession of matrimony. 2)Rule 15 was not activated nor was the service and filing of notice of appeal stayed. 3)All matters of this Court were directed to be prepared to re-examine the judgment and to make all applications to the Court of Appeal made pursuant to Rule 15 as amended. 4)The Court was also directed to make certain that all applications were directed strictly to the date the respondent had to move out of the home. 5)All applications should be directed to the court of appeal unless otherwise ordered. 6)The application of Rule 15 was never directed to a reapply nor was a notice of an appeal directed at the respondent. 7)The Rule 15 application was never to be re-directed nor was it directed to reapply unless the court had already decided otherwise. 8)All rules respecting the use of admissibility and correctness were to be adhered to. 9)The order for the exclusive possession was not stayed by the notice of appeals. 10)The provision that directions be given by the court in any event could not be interpreted to mean that all directions should be made in any circumstances other than the one made pursuant the judgment. 11)The matter was then scheduled to be heard in June 1998. In the meantime, notice of appealed was filed on behalf of Mike. On June 19, 1998, counsel for Mike took the position that with the filing the notice OF appeal, the court could still proceed to provide the requested directions. The issue resolves around the interpretive application of two subclauses (1) and (4) of Rule15 of the Courtof Appeal."

HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault. Prior to his trial, the accused gave notice that he would be making an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under s. 8, 9, and 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter had been infringed and sought a remedy. The accused was arrested, charged with the offence, and detained at the police station. At the police detachment, the officer asked the accused if he was okay with being arrested, and the accused answered that he was. During the course of the examination and seizure, the officers found that the blood-like stains on his person and clothes with 'hemosticks' were positive for blood. The officer then put the accused in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. The defence did not call any witnesses on the voir dire. The initial arrest was lawful, was not terminated by the purported 'un-arrest', and continued throughout the search and seizure at the Police station. The continued detention after the purported “de facto” arrest constituted a de facto arrest. The Court found that Epp's detention after he was 'unarrested' constituted a 'de facto' arrest. In the present case, the police officer put the person arrested by him by name but the accused was put in contact by Legal Aid. The police officer connected the accused with a lawyer working for Legal Aid and the defence did nothing to interfere with that contact. The voir net was not breached. The Crown did not establish that the defence breached the accused’s right to a fair trial."
2011skpc153.txt,The accused was charged with dangerous driving. The evidence established that the accused was observed driving a black Mustang that accelerated quickly from a red light. The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.,The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a highway in a manner that was dangerous to the public contrary to s.249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1) The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The officer was stopped behind the accused when the driver of the vehicle was observed accelerating to a rate of speed that was not normal for him. 2) The accused's objectively dangerous conduct was accompanied by the required mens rea. 3) The driving was a marked departure from the standard expected for reasonably prudent drivers. The driving must constitute a marked a departure from that of a reasonably prudent driver.

Furthermore, as the union was not a party to the original proceeding, and was not joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a Supreme Court judge, it does not have standing to file an appeal.","The union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1) and to bring an appeal from orders made in 1999 and 1999 regarding the interlocutory injunction against persons unnamed, as well as an Intended Defendant. The Union argued that the orders of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal were significantly different from those made in Adams. The application to be joined as an intervener was dismissed for the reasons set forth in the 1999 Supreme Court decision. The proposed application was also dismissed for not being joined as a partner or as an interlocutor by the Court. The Court of Appeals did not refer the application to the Union as a result of the earlier orders but rather a notice of appeal under Rule 62.35 and Rule 8.06. The union did not file any affidavits as it opposed the inclusion of the names of the individuals as defendants or intended defendants in the proceeding. The notice of appeals under Rule 8 were dismissed as well."
2_2000skqb301.txt,"Plaintiff, as litigation guardian for his four daughters, alleged that the defendant, in breach of a trust, wrongfully retained $20,000 to which his daughters are entitled. Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account. Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter. The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters. HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had wrongfully, in breach of a trust, retained the sum of $20,000 to which his four daughters were entitled. The plaintiff had four children: Mabel, Brenda, Amanda, Jonathon and Jonathon. Mabel had told her that the money in the bank account was to be held for payment of debts of Mabel's estate, with the balance to be divided between the plaintiff's four children. Mandy had requested that the plaintiff endorse three cheques in blank for the benefit of the four granddaughters. The defendant had then died before Royal Trust Company had completed the instructions by transferring the funds to the credit of the annuity contract of Daisy McIntyre. The incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust and not merely to make a transfer. The purpose of the incomplete voluntary gift was not to convert the $25,000 in the account into an equity in favour of the plaintiff, but rather to create an equity for her benefit. The intended gift was to divide the debts of the deceased's estate and be given to the four grandchildren."
2_2000skqb53.txt,"An appeal from Provincial Court on a Small Claim. The Jabours, the third parties who acquired title to the house, firmly bolted a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Abilities Council by anchor bolts in a concrete slab. The Jabours sold to the Kapronczais who in turn sold the property 2 years later to the respondent, San Diego, but made no mention about ownership of the wheelchair lift. The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift. San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty. Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land. It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty. The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs giving a claim for damages. The Provincial Court judge dismissed the claim against the third party, the Jabours, on the facts.","An appeal from a Provincial Court decision on a small claim. The claim concerned whether something affixed to realty is a fixture that passes with title to the realty. The court dismissed the claim against the respondent, Elsa San Diego, on the facts as found by the Provincial Court Judge. The wheelchair lift had ceased to operate a few months after San Diego acquired the property. The respondent had obtained the property from the Jabours and, two years later, sold the property to the respondent Elsa San Diegans. The vendors advertised the property as being good revenue care home wheelchair accessible. A few months later, the wheelchair lift ceased to function. The respondents (who had a disabled child) purchased the property and, 2 years later sold the respondent to the defendant Elsa SanDiegans. When selling the property, the vendors made no mention to the purchaser, the Abilities Council, about ownership of the wheelchair lifted. The trial judge did not accept Kapronczai's denial that he and Tania knew that the wheelchair was not part of the real estate or was owned by the Abilities council. There was evidence on which the trial judge could find as he did. The appeal was dismissed both as it affects the plaintiff and the third party. The disability lift never became part of a realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it became part part of, and the intention was a prime factor in determining whether something that is affixed does become part of (realty). Furthermore, although it was not a finding of the trial court the manner of the manner in which the manner was conducted was not sufficient to affect the plaintiff's appeal."

Application dismissed; the accused had not met the onus on the balance of probabilities of establishing that the former Superintendent had relevant or material evidence to offer concerning the issues raised by the Charter motions.

The plaintiff brought motions seeking a stay of those charges on the basis his rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated by the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy and by the RCMP during investigations of his activities and of the administration of the bankrupt corporation, which he controlled. The defendant brought several motions seeking an order compelling the Superintendent to testify at the hearings of the charter motions. The Crown applied to compel the Superintendent, under whom the charges were brought, to testify, on the grounds his rights were violated. The application was dismissed. The applicant had not met the onus which rests upon him to satisfy the Court on the balance of probabilities that the Redling has relevant or material evidence to give concerning the issues raised by the Charter Motions. There was no basis to compel him to testify.  The affidavit also raised questions about possible OSB funding of the investigation and/or prosecution of charges against the bankrupt. The evidence presented at the last two pages of the handwritten notes which were attributed to the Superintendent raised issues that warrant compelling the officer to testify concerning the charter Motions and other matters raised by them. The officer who was in the Halifax Office of The Superintendent of the Bankruptcies testified that they did not influence him. The RCMP officers involved have testified that their involvement in the investigation of the activities of the person who was the president and chief shareholder of the company was not influencing him. There is no evidence to support the belief that the OSB, under the Superintendent as Superintendent, did not pursue investigations into other parties with sufficient vigor and that the RCMP somehow dissuaded the RCMP from investigating other parties' conduct and deflected suspicion of wrongdoing to him. Nothing has come before the Court since the Subpoena was quashed (or at any time) supports those beliefs expressed by the plaintiff. Nothing which has come to the Court (or has come Before the Court) since the subpoenae was quashing (or is at any point) supports these beliefs expressed. No likelihood has been established that the officer will provide any evidence concerning the investigation into the conduct of any other person involved in the bankruptcy that would affect his rights with respect to the charges.

Solicitor and client fees totaled over $21,000. Costs fixed at $10,000 plus disbursements; there was no obligation on the defendant to admit liability but considering the amount of legal fees incurred in relation to the amount recovered, it was appropriate to go outside the tariffs.","Counsel had been unable to agree on costs after a four day trial. The plaintiffs were successful in recovering the base amount claimed but did not succeed in their claims for aggravated and punitive damages. The defendant should have admitted liability sooner rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial. Costs should be substantially increased above the usual party and party costs because, as he contended, the defendant ought to have admitted responsibility sooner rather then forcing the plaintiff to trial, and the manner in which the proceeding was conducted set out the factors that the court may consider in fixing costs. The conduct of any party which tended to shorten or unnecessarily lengthen the duration of the proceeding, and any step in the proceeding which was improper, vexatious, prolix or unnecessary, should have been considered.

Children to remain with the mother until the end of the school year, at which point primary care of the children will be granted to the applicant; child support adjusted accordingly. The mother's decision to move was not in the children's best interests and it was done either to frustrate or with a callous indifference to the children's relationship with their father.","The parties, who were married in 1993 and separated in 2002, applied to have the children placed in the custody of their father, who was living in Halifax, replaced by a new, more stable, residence in Halifax. The father had access in Bridgewater, but the mother was unable to exercise access due to the new residence and significant disruption to the father's ability to exercise control of the children.

A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused was on duty in a marked police car when the vehicle struck the complainant. The complainant was crossing the street when the accused's vehicle rolled forward and collided with the complainant's vehicle. The issue to be determined was whether the Crown has proved that the accused drove without due notice and attention applying an objective test in assessing carelessness and whether the accused has then shown, on balance of probabilities, that he exercised due diligence in the context of the circumstances he encountered. HELD: The accused's action was found to be careless driving. The officer who was driving the vehicle was first asked if he could assist the complainant and then later advised him that he would sue the man who had just come out of Super Store. The vehicle rolled to a stop directly in front of the complainant, and the complainant crossed the street on foot directly in the police vehicle.

HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving.

The police did not see the appellant driving; they came across his minivan immersed in a slough in excess of 35 feet off the highway. Based on the tire tracks, the appellant was charged with dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign. In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described. HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. While no accident reconstructionist was available to check the accident scene after the incident, the Crown could have called an expert to testify whether the defence's theory could hypothetically be rational. However, no expert was called. The appeal is allowed and the conviction set aside.","The appeal from conviction for dangerous driving was allowed and the conviction set aside. The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with Fleury's guilt and the circumstANTial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The appeal was allowed, and the convictions were set aside with costs of the appeal. The issue on appeal is whether the circumstance evidence which led the trial judge to conclude Fleury was travelling on Highway #11 was inconsistent inconsistent with an other rational decision. It was the defence's theory at trial, the accused's unwavering statement at the time of the accident that Fleury had not stopped at the stop sign. Fleury argued that, without expert evidence called by the police to prove that it was not possible for Fleury to have swerved in such a manner to create the same physical evidence, the Crown failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The appeal is allowed and conviction is set aside without leaving costs on the appeal panel. 1) The trial was not a rational process, as the expert evidence was not available at the scene of the incident. It seems unlikely that a minivan could make a 90° left turn at substantial speed without the assistance of an expert. 2) The collision was so high speed that only an expert could have drawn such a straight line as to be rational. 3) The accident was so close to the scene that there could be no rational conclusion from which the trial court could have concluded that Fleur was travelling through the stop signal without any other evidence available."

HELD: The accused are sentenced to 40 months imprisonment for the offence of robbery with violence and 4 months consecutive for the offence of having their faces masked. Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months. The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","The accuseds, both 19 years of age, were convicted after trial of committing two offences, namely, robbing cash and miscellaneous items and using violence against a clerk. The accuseds' criminal records were appalling. Most of the offences were committed when they were youth. The charges were based on robbery with violence committed at night. The clerk was forced to the floor by the accuseds. The defendants' previous record included two robbery convictions and one theft related offence. The Crown requested that the accused's sentences be reduced to terms equivalent to time served on remand. The Court of Appeal increased the sentence to two years less a day for the date of appeal. The sentences were based upon the accused having been in custody since January 31, 2007. The sentence that each of them will serve from this date is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. The factors considered in this sentencing decision were the same as in R. v. Alexson: a high speed chase ensued after the robbery on a major thoroughfare in the City of Regina, with the getaway vehicle approaching speeds of 100 kms per hour and driving through red lights. The District Court judge made no reference to the need for deterrence. HELD: The sentences are reduced to 2 years of imprisonment and 2 years consecutive for each offence.  1) The accused's criminal record consists of 2 robbery with a weapon, one charge of assault causing bodily harm and one charge for robbery with intent to commit an indictable offence. 2) The Crown sought 4 months imprisonment consecutive for the robbery with the weapon and 4 months of probation for the assault with violence.  3) The sentences in this case were based solely on the accuseds lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence against the victim, the need to deter not only these individuals but also anyone else who might consider committing the offence of robbery. The offences were met with harsh sentences, which the accused were able to manage. 4) The Court gave each of the accused two credit for time served by remand which was 20 months. The total of these sentences is 44 months."
2_2008nssm16.txt,"The claimant purchaser brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, claiming that although the defendant vendors had advised her that there had been some damage to the chimney base in the residence, she had been told that this was a minor problem which was under repair and she had not been properly advised of a history of repeated flooding.  Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony. Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed; it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation. The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries. There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot. Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.","The claimant claimed damages for a house sale because the disclosure statement did not disclose a history of repeated flooding. The claimant alleged that the respondent had burned out his shop vac cleaning up water in the basement and asked the claimant to borrow the neighbours' shop vac. The respondent denied having any knowledge of the condition of the property in the past and said the respondent did not have the necessary information to establish that the place had flooded in the Past. The parties argued that they had each other's permission to operate their business and had each prepared and submitted their evidence to the court, which was accepted by the Small Claims Court. The court dismissed the claim for non-suit, finding that the statements made by the vendors were not credible representations and that the claimant did not suffer any damage due to any non-disclosure, misinformation or misrepresentation. The Small Claims Act requires that all materials must be examined and the court weighs in favour of the vendors. The Court found that the doctrine of caveat emptor applied to the claims and the fact that the vendors' information was transparently disclosed to the Court was not a factor in determining whether the claim was a valid defence."
2_2008skca172.txt,"The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to ss. 255.(2) and 255(2) of Criminal Code. The appellant argued that cross-examination by the Crown was improper and that his conclusions were unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The trial judge allowed the appellant to be cross-examined on all of his criminal record even though some of his prior convictions were not relevant to the issue of credibility and admission of that part of the record was therefore more prejudicial than probative. 2) The appellant was prejudiced by questions as to how the bodies might have moved within the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath. 3) The questioning about previous criminal convictions by the RCMP was not objected to when it occurred. The issue of whether the appellant was the driver of the truck at the time of the crash was not raised. 4) The cross- examination of the appellant's evidence as to whether he was the only person present at the scene of the accident was found to have had an effect on the trial. 5) The defence did not cross- examine the witness on his own or in the context of his cross-and-examination. The witness's responses were relatively innocuous and did not play major role in the evidence of the accused."
2_2009skpc71.txt,"Mr. Kenny is charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with use of a searchlight when hunting. Specifically, the section reads: 11.1(2) For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The case was decided on the basis of credibility. The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused. The Court stated that, on all the evidence, it was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged.","The defendant was charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with the use of a searchlight when hunting. The defendant was found guilty of the charge. The searchlight was not used for the purposes of hunting. All three occupants of the vehicle were seated next to 30-30 rifles, one of which had one live round in the chamber, four live rounds in the magazine, and one of the two rifles that were seized. The driver and passenger were seated in the back seat of the truck with their two sons. One of the boys was seated next the driver as the driver used it as a spotlight and the other a bird and animal caller. The vehicle was under surveillance on continuous and ongoing basis for approximately 30 minutes. The RCMP were called to the scene of the accident. The Defendant acknowledged that he had been driving through the forest when he picked up his son and nephew. The parties had fallen asleep within minutes of getting into the truck. Defendant found guilty on all of the evidence of his use of the searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife. On all of these facts, the Court was convinced that the defendant was using the search light for the intended purposes of his offence. The evidence was that the Defendant had purchased one million candle lights and a radio with a cassette tape of moose mating sounds and that he returned to the same area to pick up his nephew and niece. The Court was satisfied that the evidence was consistent with an inescapable inference that the accused was using it for the hunting purposes."
2_2011nssc290.txt,"Rule 85.04 – Order for confidentiality The parties moved under Rule 59.60 to have the court seal their file after media asked to view it. They didn't ask to exclude the public from the hearing, nor did they seek a publication ban.  , the file will be sealed. While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does. The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies. A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs. Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough. Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents). Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern. The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place). There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff. The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered. The open court principle was crafted at a time when the internet wasn't a public source of information and manipulation.","The parties had both requested an order to seal the contents of their divorce file. The petitioner had requested that the file be sealed as a condition of its filing. The respondent had also requested that all documents in the file should be sealed in its entirety. The parties had each requested that their divorce files be sealed to protect their reputation, their reputation and the public interest. The applicant and respondent both sought to have their divorce applications sealed. The first step was to determine whether there was a social value or public interest to be had in sealing the file. HELD: The applicant's application was granted. The sealing order was not necessary because the public had a legitimate expectation that personal identifiers would be protected in order to prevent identity theft and that the risk of identity theft was real. The second step was for the parties to provide an affidavit outlining their expectations and concerns. The court would not permit the publication of any information that might be of interest to the respondent. The third step was ensuring that the public would have a fair opportunity to learn about the applicant's past and present relationships with her children and grandchildren. The filing of a divorce application was a completely different matter. The public interest in a public interest and public interest must be one in which the public in general has an interest or has a stake. The only conclusion that could be drawn was that the applicant had not established that there was some social value and public Interest in sealing of the file which would impede the public's access to the justice system. The salutary effects of a sealing order do outweigh their deleterious effects because the court has a general interest in preserving confidential information and there is no important commercial interest for the purposes of this test. The application for sealing of all the documents in this file was granted with conditions. The judge reviewed the factors set out in R. v. Find 2001 SCC 32 and R.v. Spence 2005 SCC 71 and determined that the salutaries of a sealed order do not outweigh the deleteriously effects of one. The applications to seal files were dismissed because the general public in an open court is not completely circumscribed by this order."

He applied to vary the order to correspond to the alleged agreement. The Wife denied any agreement to reduce the original order and sought judgment for arrears in the amount of $55,000.00. HELD: On a review of all material filed, the Court concluded that it was not possible to resolve the matter summarily. The Court directed a trial of the issues between the parties.","FIAT. The applicant applied for an order varying the support provisions of a 1989 judgment. He sought an order requiring a total payment of $570.75 per month for both children.

3_1997canlii11384.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. who was alleged to be of unsound mind. H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing. The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself. An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order. 1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings. 2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected. If the court failed to intervene H.B. will be left in limbo, a victim of the system.","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a child protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. The child was apprehended at birth and is the subject of a Child Protection Hearing. HELD: The order was granted. 1)The Public Trustees Act does not authorize the appointment of the Public trustee as a litigation guardian on behalf of H. B. However that becomes evident when s. 32 is considered in the context of the entire Act. It is intended to authorize the Public Board to protect and administer the property of infants and dependant adult children. Nowhere does the Act authorize the the PublicTrustee to act as the personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. 2)The Act does have a role in the sense of 'panoply' of jurisdictions, which is inexact and inexistent. The Public Truste is the appropriate person to act on behalfof H. b. Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction, this Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of HBC. She requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected (see: Macdonald v. Macdonald). 3)The inclusion of the public trustee in the definition of litigation guardian circumscribed by reference to s32 of the Act. Therefore the Rules do not enlarge the provisions of the act and cannot serve as the basis to appoint the Public as a lawyer to represent the personal interests as opposed to the property interests of a dependent adult or person under mental disability. 4)Costs were ordered."
3_1998canlii1477.txt,"The plaintiff was subcontracted by the City of Dartmouth to build a sports field. The defendant were the project consultants for the City, and were involved throughout the tendering process and construction. Their report indicated a number of significant potential problems. The plaintiff was not made aware of the report when it bid on the project. The plaintiff subsequently became aware of the problems, which made their work more costly. After completing the work, it commenced a claim for the additional work which had to be performed due to the undisclosed site conditions. The defendants were joined by the City as a third party to that action. The plaintiff was successful at trial, but the decision was overturned on appeal. The plaintiff then commenced the present action directly against the defendant, alleging negligent misrepresentation. The defendant applied to strike the action on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. Granting the application, that the present cause of action is the same one litigated in the first action, simply under a different legal concept. To allow the plaintiff to relitigate the same action on the same factual basis would be an abuse of process.","The plaintiff was the successor corporate entity of Turf Masters Landscaping Limited by virtue of an amalgamation of the two companies. Turf masters had obtained a subcontract to perform most of the work on a recreational park and sports field for the City of Dartmouth. The consultants for the city had been involved in a previous action which had been described as a'state of affairs' action. Turff Masters bid on and obtained the subcontract for most of construction without being aware of the prior reports. Shortly after commencing the work, the City and the plaintiff commenced an action against the City, alleging negligent misrepresentation and breach of standard of care. Turfs Masters commenced a second action against City and sought to have the matter heard at one trial. The City refused to defend the first action and Turfmasters brought a claim against the city and city jointly and severally. Turfing Masters applied for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada which denied the application. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The doctrine of res judicata and abuse of process was not applicable to the first application. 2)The Court was satisfied that to allow the defendant to now basically relitigate the same action on the same factual basis on a different legal concept would be an abuse of the process. 3)The defendant's application was also dismissed. 4)The court was satisfied there was no evidence that the defendant's conduct during the first two actions was a form of negligent misrepresentations or that it intended to expand its available damages. Many tens of thousands of dollars by the parties, not to mention court time and resources, would have to be expended on relitigation of the same issue."
3_1999canlii12258.txt,An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children. He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.,"The appellant was granted the right to lead evidence concerning matters relevant to the issues between the parties. The issue on appeal was whether the appellant had custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s. 9 of the Guidelines; whether the payments were included within the guideline as a proportion of the time that they should have been paid; whether they fell within the meaning of s. 7(1)(f) of the guideline; whether these payments were within the standard of living and therefore appropriate in their application; whether such payments fell within s7(1(f) given the income of the children's parents. HELD: The portion of the judgment relating to payments under s7.1(F) of The Guidelines was set aside. The appeal was dismissed. 1)No reversible error was found in the judge's decision, explained in the reasons for judgment to reject the appellant's arguments respecting that issue. 2)No error was explained in his reasons for the decision supported by written reasons. 3)The portion of judgment relating the payments under 7(2)(f)(i) of Guidelines was aside. In all of the circumstances, we can not see that the appellant was deprived of the right of lead evidence on any relevant issue and we must accordingly find that the judge made no reversible error."

The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached. In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary. 1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another. Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles. The R. v. Emke decision is outdated. 3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty. There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with two offences contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and one for driving while impaired contrary to ss. 253 and 253(b) of The RCMP. The accused argued that his Charter rights were guaranteed by Section 21 of the Charter and that his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure guaranteed by s. 27(5) of that Act. The police officer was on his way out of town and stopped a marked police vehicle. The officer observed the vehicle displayed an out of date sticker on it's license plate in violation of S. 27 of the Highway Traffic Act. He engaged the police lights and conducted a search for open liquor. The vehicle hit the curb, bounced off the curb and rolled off the sidewalk. The officers approached the accused who identified himself as a peace officer. He asked him why he had not stopped and he said he was in the lawful execution of his duty. The Crown argued that the officer was mistaken and had jurisdiction to make the demand. The defence argued that there was no good public policy reason for the police force to be excluded from operating in any specific geographic area. The court concluded that the police officer's duty was to protect the public and to assist the administration of justice. The Court also concluded that there would be no good reason for a police officer to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned or to be charged with any offence contrary to the provisions of s. 19 of the Police Act. In reviewing the scheme and object of the RCMP, the Court concluded that this was a random stop and that the officers were acting in the course of their duties. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner to take away jurisdiction granted to officer by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act or the Criminal Law Enforcement Act."

The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths. HELD: The wife was entitled to judgment for $54,000. 1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention. This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home.

The Rentalsman's order required the tenant to pay $2,930.01. The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence. The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process. While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting. The Rentalsman's decision, made after reviewing pictures, repair bills and the statements of house cleaners, who indicated the hours worked and their hourly rate, was not patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the evidence.","A tenant appealed the rental home's Rentalsman's decision. The tenant had claimed damages for rent loss, cleaning costs, damages to the premises and utilities which were not paid. The landlord had also applied to amend his claim to include an amendment to the Residential Tenancies Act to allow him to pay the total sum of $2,930 to the landlord. The Rentalsmann had originally determined that the tenant's claim was patently unreasonable and unreasonable, and therefore his decision was not patently reasonable given the evidence. The tenants appealed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The rental home was properly rented and the amendment was allowed. The rentalsman was not trying to overturn the tenant’s claim based on all the evidence; he was just trying to meet the needs of the tenant. The decision of the Rentalsmans was not unreasonable based on the evidence and was not based on patently unreasonably unreasonable evidence."
3_2003skqb93.txt,"The company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by its creditor pursuant to Part III of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide. He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status. HELD: The Proposal was accepted.  1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA. The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims. Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal. 2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation. Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.  3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing.","The applicant obtained an order granting court approval of a proposal made by it to its creditor pursuant to Part III of Division I of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The applicant sought to amend the proposal to reflect the fact that the pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor than the unsecured creditors who had been awarded the benefit of the previous transfer and that the indemnification of past directors and officers proposed by the terms of the Proposal was inappropriately wide. The proposed amended para. 9.1 of the proposed proposed was consistent with the provisions of ss. 50(13) and s. 50 (6.1) of the Act. Taking into account the applicant's past and present pension obligations, the applicant proposal is reasonable and calculated to benefit the general body of creditors. The creditor's position on the liability and pension obligations of the pension plans is better placed than the applicant’s own position."

HELD: 1) On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The child is now 15 years old. The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.  2) The access was varied in January 2004. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund. If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4) The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working. The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control. The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use. The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review. The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","FIAT. The respondent applied to vary the support and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 judgment. The 1995 judgment provided for the divorce of the petitioner and distribution of matrimonial property estate to the couple, and custody, access and support for the child of the marriage. The petitioner asserted that he was the sole custodian of the child and that if the court ordered a variation it would require that the child be solely custodian. The applicant, now 15, applied to have the 1995 judgment varied. The court dismissed the respondent's application to vary custody and arrears. There had not been a material change to warrant a variation of the 1995 custody order and the respondent was, as of August 2003, 10 months in arrearars of child support. There were no costs awarded."
3_2005nssc122.txt,"The 23 year old defendant pled guilty to two counts of breaking and entering a dwelling house and one count of breaking and entering a shed. He cooperated with the police and provided evidence against his co-accused. He had a previous criminal record, which included convictions for mischief, theft, break and enter, breach of an undertaking and possession of stolen goods. Defendant sentenced to four years imprisonment; in assessing the appropriate sentence, the court allowed a credit for time already served (which was served virtually throughout in protective custody), a credit of 25% for the fact that the defendant had pled guilty and a further reduction of one and a half years for the defendant's assistance in pursuing the successful prosecution of his co-accused.","The accused, who was charged with aggravated assault, broke into two residences and stole property including a metal pipe. He also entered into plea agreements with the co-accused and the defence. The accused plead guilty to three counts of break and enters. The charges were based on an incident where the accused was driving his vehicle off the road and went off the highway. The Crown sought a period of six years incarceration. The co-occused, who had a Grade X education, had sporadic employment over his adult years. The defence argued that the accused had less than perfect upbringing and co-operated fully with the police, including testifying at the trial of his co-defendants. The sentencing guidelines were set out in R. v. Parker, 1981 CanLII 3363 (ON SC), 61 C.C.C.(2d) 544. The Court of Appeal preferred a sentence of four years and six months in a federal institution, followed by a 10 year prohibition from possessing or consuming a weapon. The sentences were based upon the factors set out by the Court of appeal in Rountree. The offences were committed in respect of a number of residences. The defendant was driving a vehicle when he entered the premises. He was charged under s. 279(2) of the Code and was convicted of breaking and entering. The parties then entered two more residences and took property valued at between $5,000 and $10,000. The third count involved a knife not a firearm. The sentence for the co -accused who was convicted in the first offence was 10 years imprisonment with a fine of $100,000, the sentences for the break and enter were reduced to 10 years and 6 months in federal institution. The amount of time that the Crown must spend in custody was reduced to reflect the fact that the defendant had spent several years in custody."
4_1999canlii12738.txt,"The accused is on trial for armed robbery and the central issue is identity. The Court admitted a letter into evidence in which the accused attempts to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi for him. HELD: Accused found guilty. The accused was correctly identified. The Court drew an adverse inference against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by. The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's purpose in writing the letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry. The letter is direct evidence of where the accused was not at the time of the robbery and is corroboration for the identification evidence of the Crown witness.",The accused was charged with robbery. The accused asserted that he was not at the club at the time of the robbery but that his girlfriend and his girlfriend were nearby. HELD: The accused was convicted of robbery. 1)The letter was not an alibi but was an attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibibi by perjury. 2)The accused admitted that he wrote the letter to his girlfriend as a favour to the Crown. He did not meet the burden of proof that he did not attend the club. 3)The defence alleged that the accused's failure to identify the accused in the photo ID line-up was a form of fabricating. 4)The allegation that the defence intended to fabricatify the evidence was proven with a precision not found in the absence of a reasonable doubt that the person identified in the picture ID line up was the accused. 5)The admission by the accused that he wasn't at the Club at the relevant time was not a reasonable inference that he conspired to fabricace an albibi. The admission by him that he only attended the club two hours before the robbery was a sufficient inference that the allegation that he committed the robbery is a fabrication. 6)The evidence was reasonably reliable. The only thing that could have been wrong was that the picture of the accused with a mustache was not drawn together with the other evidence.

HELD: The application was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Court is still of the view the proposed appellants would have little chance of success on appeal. Costs are a discretionary award and there was material on file upon which the trial judge could base his decision. The appellants failed to first apply to the trial judge to obtain leave to appeal as required by Queen's Bench Act s.38.,The proposed appellants applied to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal of a Queen's Bench trial judge order awarding costs to the proposed respondent jointly and personally. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs on double column V. The parties had not taken out the order and thus had retained jurisdiction to decide the matter. The proposed appellant principles would have little chance of success on appeal as costs were a discretionary award and there was material on file upon which the trial judge could base his decision.

He questioned the validity of service by mail arguing personal service was required. HELD: Whether the appellant was validly served is an issue that will properly presented to and determined by the Court hearing the appeal. Bringing an application under Queen's Bench Rule 271 would have been a more expeditious procedure. The stay was granted since this was the type of appeal that can be expedited. The monies paid into court will remain in Court pending the hearing and determination of the appeal. Costs were reserved to the Court hearing the appeal.,The appellant appealed an order granted in Queen's Bench granting him child support. He argued that personal service was required. He also questioned the validity of service by mail. The Queen'sBench file indicates that the application was served by mail addressed to his home address an address which he designated as his address for service upon electing to represent himself. Whether the appellant was validly served under the Queen's bench Rules is an issue that will have to be properly presented and determined by the division of the Court hearing the appeal. HELD: The appellant was granted stay under rule 15 of the Queen’s Bench Rules. He was directed to pay child support in the amount of $633 per month. He would have also been directed to arrange for the respondent to pay costs. The appellant would have taken enforcement proceedings under rule 271 but instead chose to apply for an order under rule 14 staying execution and garnishment proceedings under the Rules.
4_2004skqb19.txt,"The applicant applied by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents, Zurich and Sovereign, were obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against the applicant. The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident. What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence. Further, the work/product exclusion clauses in the policies relieve the respondents from any duty to defend.","The applicant applies by originating a motion for a declaration that the respondents are obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against them and others by Genex Swine Group Inc. (the 'underlying action'). The applicant specifies that each of the respondents issued comprehensive general liability policies in favour of the applicant. The respondents take the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend (and to pay defence costs) for the claims brought against the applicant in the underlying action. HELD: 1) The applicant is entitled to rely on the allegations made in the pleadings filed against it. It must look beyond the choice of labels, and examine the substance of the allegations contained in the pleadingings. It is only where there is genuine ambiguity or doubt that the duty to defend must be resolved in favour the insured. 2) The applicants are negligent and breached their contractual and other duties owed by the applicant as a result of the application and the use of the Galvalume alternate. 3) The defendants are negligent, and breached the contractual and Other duties owed. 4) The mere fact that Genex alleges both negligence and breach of contract is of no moment to alter the applicant's duty to protect. The application and breach are dismissed. 5) The defendant is also liable to pay costs in the amount of one-half of the claim. 6) The liability is only set out in the terms of the policy. The defendant has a duty to vigorously defend and the onus shifts to the applicant to establish that the claim is not covered by reason of an exclusion under the policy in the circumstances. The liability lies with the insurer."
4_2005nssc253.txt,"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.",The plaintiff made a significant claim for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment under Rule 31.01. The defendant argued that there were significant other factors that would contribute in significant way to her current health problems. The plaintiff argued that she had not been able to establish the motor vehicle accident resulted in her suffering injuries. The summary judgment application was allowed and the costs of the appeal were set aside. The court read the affidavits of the plaintiff's doctors and read the material attached to the defendant's affidavit. It was not the function of the court to determine the matter of an interim payments to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them. The Court was satisfied there had to be an 'air of realty' to the defendants' argument. There had to been a significant change in the plaintiff from the injury which resulted in the loss of valuable service and that the plaintiff ought not to be successful in her application for summary judgement because she has not been unable to establish that the motorveh accident resulted into her suffering injury. The plaintiffs injuries were minor and there was no 'air to reality' to their argument. The defendants argued that their prior conditions would all contribute in a significant way in the cause of the accident resulting in her suffer injuries. They also argued that the plaintiffs prior medical history would contribute to her ongoing health problems and that there was a credibility issue to be tried. The applicant argued that it would be impossible for the court not to accept the plaintiff because of her recent minor injuries. Summary judgment issued against the defendant with damages to be assessed. The costs of this appeal and of the application before Judge Burke were ordered to be costs in the Cause of the action.
4_2006nssc88.txt,"The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","The mother had been paying child and spousal support since the parties' separation in 1993. The father had made arrangements for monthly payments of $2,000 to be made directly to the mother and to the father by the mother. The mother had difficulty obtaining employment and had difficulty paying the father's maintenance. She claimed she had no financial contribution to the children's education and that the father had taken advantage of the arrangement to reduce the payments to $2 per month. The parties' income had declined since the separation and the mother had taken action with Maintenance Enforcement. She alleged she had been unable to obtain employment and that she owed the father $69,500 in matrimonial debt and any other debt in his name. The husband had paid support by way of post-dated cheques directly to her and the wife destroyed any cheques she received from Maintenance Enforcement which she had not received in the previous amount. She also claimed she owed $2k in spousals and child support. The standard variation clause is contained in the Separation Agreement and refers to s. 17 of the Divorce Act. The payments documented in 2001 were consistent and in 2005 were $2 million. The wife claimed she received no money in September and October, 2005 as result of the mother's failure to obtain a second opinion on her position in the workplace. She was unable to locate employment and her income was reduced to $1,000 per month by the father. She had no savings, pre-separation RRSP's or equity in the home. The family history of the children leaving their mother's care and moving in with their father and being supported by their father was not reliable. There was no change in the father’s support since they had moved from the mother’ s home. He paid support directly and indirectly. The court reviewed the history of their children leaving the mother-and-children’ care and moved to live with the father and wife. The oldest daughter graduated high school in 1999 and was working in the private sector. She said she had lost her job and was unable afford to move. She believed she was entitled to some form of employment. She attributed her failure to learn how to manage a job and to avoid debt by the husband to her children. She did not establish any employment prospects or any other income source. She assumed she was owed child and child maintenance. The respondent had no claim to the arrears owed by her and she did not have any claim to any equity in her home. She continued to"
4_2017skqb205.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8 The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim. ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order and seek an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the Enforcement of Money Judgments Act and $40,000 security for costs. The first application was denied. The defendants then applied to amend the order to add the plaintiff as a plaintiff and to amend its Statement of Claim. The second application was granted in part. The court reviewed the legal test and adopted the test used in Duke v. Vervaeck, 2013 SKQB 591(CanLII), 138 Sask 277. The purpose of the Queen's Bench Rule is to protect the reputation of a public trust and to provide protection against concealment and other financial fraud. The preservation order was originally authorized pursuant to the Merchant Bank Order. The Court reviewed the case law in Blanchard & Associates, 2013 SHQB 574 (CanLIII), 138 S.W.L. 1 (Attorney General), adopting the test in Blanche & Associates. The Chambers judge adopted the standard approach for addressing applications arising under s. 7 of The Enforcement of money Judgments (EMJA) which is that the court should not terminate an order obtained by consent. The reverse onus is on the applicant to establish that the preservation ordered was not breached by the defendant. The necessary prejudice has not been demonstrated. The two conditions specified in the EMJA apply to an application to terminate a preservation order pursuant to ss. 20(a) and (b). The Court exercised its discretion to order the plaintiff added as a defendant and the statement of claim amended in accordance with the draft Amended Statement of claim."
5_1994canlii4347.txt,"The plaintiff was found to be two-thirds and the defendant one-third responsible for an accident which occurred when the defendant's car hit the plaintiff as she tried to cross the highway on her bicycle. The court awarded costs to the plaintiff fixed at the amount involved - the quantum of general damages. The parties were unable to reach an amount of settlement. In this matter, the defendant argued that the costs should be fixed at the amount actually recovered by the plaintiff. Awarding the plaintiff one-third of her taxed costs, that to reduce costs by the percentage of fault of the plaintiff and to reduce the amount involved would be a double reduction.","The plaintiff was found two-thirds responsible for the injuries suffered when the defendant's vehicle struck her while she was attempting to cross the highway. Damage to the defendant was determined at $1,255.25. The defendant agreed to apportion costs in the amount of $50,000 to the plaintiff on a Tariff A scale and fixed the amount at $50.00. The plaintiff requested a reduction in the rate of interest and sought damages. Counsel advised that there may be special circumstances that would warrant an exercise of discretion. The court adopted the standard of review and apportioned costs in such a fashion as to reflect the reality of the accident, and in such circumstances the appropriate rate of rate of appeal would be 2.5% per annum."
5_2000skqb565.txt,"FIAT. The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay. There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges.",FIAT. The accused applied for an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing a number of counts and an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay. The Crown had earlier applied to quash a number more counts and had included in them a number that dealt with the possibility of the accused being found guilty under s. 380(1)(a) of The Criminal Code. The application to quashed a number was dismissed as the Crown did not advance its case against the accused more broadly than it did against the co-accused. The Court found that the Crown had not shown that it would be bound by the conclusions of the trial judge in the current indictment. The applicant argued that the new indictment raised substantively the same questions as that made in the original indictment but the Crown chose not to appeal those findings. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that there was clearly no promise by the Crown that it was bound by any of the findings in the previous indictment but that it did consider an application to order the indictment separated pursuant to ss. 590 (the Crown's right to rely upon the findings of the Court in the Schafer case). The Crown was not bound by that promise. It was only reasonable to expect that the conclusions would be different from that already determined by the trial court in the earlier indictment but it was also reasonable to suspect that the latter would be more forthcoming in his evidence and would be less likely to be found guilty. The only thing that could be said to be different was that the Court would have preferred the Crown to remain in the lead in this matter and the Court could not predict that the result would be worse.
5_2001canlii345.txt,"The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act. No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to s38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act, 1997. The accused was stopped by a police officer as he was proceeding through a rural area when he noticed a tractor trailer travelling in an easterly direction. The officer noted that the trailer was overweight and there were three sets of axles on the unit- steering axle, drive axles and tridem axles. No overweigt permits had been issued to the accused and so the officer issued a ticket to the driver. The Provincial Court did not issue a notice to the Minister and the accused did not receive any notice. Traffic signs were posted along a public highway leading to and from Swift Current and various other locations along the grid roads. The Department of Highways had erected signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway. No other notice was given to the general public."

The second is that a Chambers judge may not have jurisdiction to make an order sought after all. The Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to deal with procedural matters but is better equipped to dealwith the evidentiary matters which are likely to arise in the course of the applicant's attempts to place her position before the Court. The Family Division is better able to deal With the evidentiaries matters which may arise in course of her attempts to establish her position on the Court's behalf.

The issue in this application to vary spousal support was whether there had been a material change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support since their 1999 interspousal contract. The wife requested a 50% increase based on the husband's income increase of 50%. She suffered from MS and was unable to work. HELD: Spousal support was varied to $3,500 monthly. The only material change in the wife's means and needs is that fact she is residing with a new partner who resides in her home in exchange for yard work and housework. Although he worked, he made no apparent financial contribution to the household. The wife was awarded costs fixed at $1,000.","FIAT. The issue was whether there had been a material change in circumstances by virtue of a change in either the husband's or wife's employment status or financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support. The husband's position was summarized in his affidavit as follows: $3,000 per month spousals will be varied to $5,500 per month. HELD: An increase was warranted, but not to the extent claimed by the wife. Spousal Support was to be varied at $1,000. The wife's needs were affected by cohabitation with a new partner. 1)The company's retained earnings, year by year, were $2,450 for house repairs, maintenance and yard work, $2200 for travel and auto expenses were now paid by the company. 2)The generous bonuses were based on the previous year's profits. The company's earnings were not adequately or reasonably accounted for in the wife's presentation. 3)An increase was justified, but did not to extent claimed the wife; spousousal and loan support were varied to the amount of $1 million."
5_2006skca7.txt,"This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC. The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC. The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the respondent was subordinate to a mortgage holding by the appellant, the respondent, Farm Credit Canada (hereafter 'the R.M.'), even though the R.Ms. mortgage was registered before the respondent's mortgage. The appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent. HELD: 1) The trial judge held that the respondent had priority over the appellant. The appellant's situation was distinguishable from that described by Baynton J. in Royal Trust, for the fact that the second FCC Mortgage had priority as well as a prior security interest of $3,125,000. The respondent had agreed to purchase the land from the CPR and to purchase from the RMB. The R.m. had agreed that it would be subordinate to the CPR only. 2) The respondent agreed to a postponement in favour of the RMT. The trial court held that, by virtue of the respondent having entered a leasehold mortgage in favourof the RM., the respondent obtained priority over its mortgage of the same type. 3) The appeal was dismissed with cost to the applicant."
5_2007skpc74.txt,"Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.' The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was charged with impaired operation, driving over.08 and breach of his s. 7 rights. The voir dire was held following a voir net on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer. The accused made self-incriminating statements to the officer as a result of his belief that he was reporting the accident. The officer concluded that the accused believed he was Reporting the accident when he gave self- incriminating statements as a reward for reporting the incident. He therefore placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation and for failing to provide a breath sample. The defence argued that since the accused made these statements, even though they were made under compulsion of statute, they amounted to a violation of his rights and were inadmissible. HELD: The evidence received by the officer was as the result of a breach of the accused's s.7 rights. If the accused believes he wasreporting the accident, he gave these self--incrimination statements to police as a matter of course. The admission of those statements would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions of the officer. 1) The arrest was illegal and exclude all evidence obtained thereafter, or at least that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police cannot rely on that information to make the demand. 2) The self- incriminating Statements That Were Made Under compulsion of Statute Have been excluded. The police officer followed up on those excluded statements with respect to impairment. 3) The accused responded to the police officer that he knew his rights, understood the warning and demand for the blood and was cooperative throughout. However, he had no recollection of the police following up on the excluded statements. 4) The evidence obtained, the statements in particular were self-initiating and conscriptive. The evidence must only be excluded based upon the factors expressed in R. v. Collins, R.v. Stillman, 1997 CanLII 384 (SCC), 113 C.C.C.(3d) 321. The Crown conceded that the Crown did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly and if the accused gave self incriminating Statements to the Police officer as A result of this belief, then the trial unfair. The Court held that the officer acted in good faith by following up his excluded statements by providing a warning and a blood demand. 5) The defence appealed. They argued that the statements were made in breach of their rights and that the officers were instructed not to make those statements."
5_2008nssc77.txt,"The claimant brought an action in the Small Claims Court to enforce a default judgment it had been granted against the defendant in Alberta for breach of contract. The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","The claimants commenced an action for breach of contract against the respondent in Alberta Court of Queen's Bench. The respondent did not file a defence and the claimants obtained default judgment for an amount not cited in either parties' submissions. The Respondent commenced an application in Small Claims Court for reciprocal enforcement of the Alberta judgment under the common law, and in the alternative, enforcement of a debt as contract. The claim was reduced from the amount of its judgment to fall within the monetary limits established by the Small Claims Act and the parties agreed the issues on appeal were matters of law and the Standard of Review was correctness. The applicant appealed the decision of the Small claims Court adjudicator wherein he determined that he lacked jurisdiction to hear the action filed by the claimants. Rather than determine a claim based on a fixed amount, it is apparent an Adjudicator would be called upon first to settle a dispute regarding the original Court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract, and a factual dispute concerning attornment. Taking into account the purpose of the legislation, the remedial goals, the underlying values of efficiency and access to justice, and the potential for a complex fact finding process, the present claim extends beyond the authority of the small claims court."

A Registrar may assess any bill for legal services, provided that the application is filed within 30 days or more if a judge makes a discretionary order to extend the period for assessment if it is in the interests of justice to do so. The issue if whether the applicant's two bills fall with the said 30 days or if this is a case where it is appropriate to abridge the time for allowing an assessment. HELD: It is in the interest of justice to order an assessment. The bills were issued in two separate matters. In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue. There will be no extension of time for the first bill. The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it. He was advised that the bill would be adjusted. An initial adjustment was made and when still not satisfied, ongoing discussions about the bill continued. The Court held that the last document received by the applicant was not the final bill as it was still subject to change. In this case, the lawyer has been paid from monies held in trust for the client, the time being abridged is relatively short and neither party has alleged that any prejudice would result.","HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the bill rendered by the applicant was not a final bill and that it was in the interests of justice to abridge the time for an assessment by the registrar. The applicant’s two bills fell within the period of time allowable for an assessing by the registry, and if not, whether it was the interests in the best interests of the justice to allow for an Assessment by the Registrar. The evidence showed that the defendant had discussions with the registrars concerning the appropriateness of the account at the time it was rendered and for a period of period of Time thereafter. Neither party had alleged or established that any prejudice would result from the abridgement of time. The Court found that it would not be in the justice’ interests to extend the time to assess the account.

5_2016skqb384.txt,"Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code for driving with a blood alcohol content of over.08. The trial judge erred in finding there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial court found that there was sufficient evidence, when viewed objectively, to support the officer's contention that the appellant was impaired. The standard of review is correctness and the test for correctness is whether the trial judge made any errors in law. 2) The appellant contends that the trial court erred by failing to consider that other cars had previously made a tight turn as evidenced by other tire tracks in the soft snow. Smokers will light up cigarette not solely for the purpose of masking the odour of alcohol on their breath but out of nervousness or other cause. There was no evidence that the accused's behaviour was out of the ordinary. 3) The appeal court found there was not a palpable or overriding error in the trial decision on whether the appellant had a right to a breath sample. The fact that the respondent had four and one half years' experience as a police officer was not the only factor contributing to the officer’s decision to believe she was impaired by alcohol. 4) The standard for assessing the findings of fact is whether there was a breach of s. 10(b) Charter rights and that the appeal court should not intervene unless it has been required to do so. 5) The court found with respect to the appellant that the failure to provide the appellant with a Prosper warning resulted in a breach pursuant to s. 9(b). The trial officer was only required to consider the other cars that had previously passed the vehicle in the field. The police had an obligation to refrain from eliciting any incriminating evidence until the detainee had been given the opportunity to consult with legal counsel. The appeal judge properly found that the waiver must be free and voluntary and must not be the product of either direct or indirect compulsion. The Standard required for an effective waiver of counsel is very high. 6) The Court found that it was not necessary to consider all relevant evidence in making the determination that there is sufficient objective evidence for the officer to make a breath demand. The Court also found that in the circumstances, the trial officer made the right to be given a reasonable opportunity to contact legal counsel without delay."

The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure. She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy.

There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time. The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old. He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court. The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program. The parties were prohibited from discussing the report process with the child and they were ordered not to influence, coach, sway, or prompt the child towards particular views or statements for the purposes of the report.

5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","The plaintiff and defendant were involved in a lawsuit regarding a sale of three quarters of land in the Rural Municipality of Hazel Dell. The plaintiff and prospective buyer had each made out packages of four or five draft plans for their farm, which they intended to use to explore the market but not necessarily conclude with sale of the land. The defendant and plaintiff commenced this lawsuit after the bidding process closed with the plaintiff not accepting the package offer. The issue was whether the packages were enforceable. The issues were determined through the bidding and post-bidding process and the plaintiff's claim that he had not received the three draft plans but had chosen not to sell the land, and whether the package plans met the plaintiff’s requirements to make the offer reasonable. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $1,050,000.00 and ordered to pay the defendant $625,000 plus $375,000 to settle the contract. The court accepted the plaintiff for his services and that he was not obligated to sell any land to the prospective buyer. The contract was created between the plaintiff and the defendant based on the defendant’ s understanding of the terms of the packages and the fact that they were both in agreement. The Court also awarded costs of the action on the basis of the plaintiff retaining the costs of production. The judgment was also awarded on the amount of the settlement. The plaintiffs’ costs were awarded on a party-to-party basis."

All three counsels submitted that although they had already written their decision, they had not considered it possible that the judge had a closed-minded mind.

The applicant's materials are deficient. Several necessary documents must be filed. In addition, the Farm Land Security Board has not completed its mandatory tasks under the Act. HELD: Application adjourned and leave is given to each party to file further materials. The Farm Land Security Board is requested to provide its report to the Court. Ordinarily, the deficiency in the applicant's motion might merit dismissal, but the Act would then give the respondent a 1 year grace period. This result is unwarranted given that the scheme of the legislation is to encourage discussions between debtor and creditor and the respondent has refused to discuss mortgage issues. Further, the respondent's refusal to provide information should not be allowed to derail the process of financial review by the Farm Land Security Board. No costs to any party.","FIAT. The applicant motion materials filed by the respondent were deficient and ought to include a copy of the notices of intention with proper proofs of service and a certified copy of title to the land in question to establish that the 'equitable mortgage' is registered and that the proper parties are before the court. The Farm Land Security Board ought to complete it mandatory tasks under Section 12 under the Act and provide its report in the format described in s. 12(12)(a) and (b) of the Act.

6_2000skqb202.txt,"An appeal from a decision of the Deputy Rentalsman ordering the landlord to pay $3,414.50 to the tenant. In issue was the jurisdiction of the Deputy Rentalsman to impose an award on the appellant who was acting as a representative for the landlord and not in his own right and who had not received notice that he was to be a named party at a hearing where an award could be made against him and who was unable to prepare and present a defence on his own behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The material clearly showed the appellant received notice that he was named as a party and in fact was the only party named as landlord. An itemized list of the damages claimed was attached to the notice. There was nothing to indicate he was unable to prepare and present a defence. 2)There was no error of law. The definition contained in s.2(d)(ii) was considered in Lachance v. Auzano Asset which held s.2(d)(ii) was determinative of the issue. The Act is intended to provide an informal and efficient procedure for determining landlord and tenant disputes. This goal is facilitated by permitting such individuals as property managers to assume the role and status of landlords (Lachance).","An appeal of a decision by the Deputy Rentalsman ordering the landlord to pay the sum of $3,414 to the respondent. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The correct definition of an agent of the landlord is that of a representative for a landlord. The fact that the appellant received notice that he was named as a party in the hearing notice clearly indicated that he wasn't named as such. There was nothing to indicate that he had not received notice of a hearing where an award could be made against him. The only question left is whether an agent is held liable for damages to a tenant."
6_2003skqb3.txt,"The applicant sought a declaration that the charges against her could not constitute professional misconduct without contravening the Charter and Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; an order of prohibition to prevent the SAPLN discipline committee or Association from hearing the charges; a declaration that the charges are res judicata; an order for particulars; costs. HELD: The application was dismissed in its entirety with taxed costs to SAPLN.  1)No order for further particulars was made at this time. The Hearing Notice particularizes the factual allegations and is specific as to time and their nature. 2)The only matter previously considered by the discipline committee dealt with whether there was any professional misconduct established arising out of criminal convictions for illegal picketing prior to the applicant becoming a member of SALPN. 3)The Act provides an adequate alternate remedy, which should be pursued. There were no special circumstances upon which the court could exercise its discretion to determine the merits of this application or to provide the relief sought.","The applicant seeks an order declaring the charges cannot be professional misconduct without contravening provisions of The Saskatchewan Charter and The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code and an order of prohibition to prohibit the discipline committee from hearing the charges. HELD: 1) The applicant is a member of the Association and is charged with professional misconduct contrary to s. 24 of The Licensed Practical Nurses Act. 2) The facts are alleged to support the conclusion that the applicant is guilty of professional misconduct. 3) The application for a writ of prohibition from proceeding with the hearing of the charges is denied. 4) The court must not entertain an application where there is a convenient alternative remedy available. The procedure on appeal, the composition of the senate committee, its powers and the manner in which they were exercised are probably to be exercised by a body which was not a professional court of appeal and was not bound to act exactly as one nor likely to do so. 5) The Court must not be limited in its application of the doctrine of the 'adequate alternative remedy' as a bar to judicial review. The Act provides an elaborate complaints investigation and discipline process, with access to the courts through rights of appeal for the member being disciplined. The statements referred to are incorrect and he knew or should have known them to be incorrect. He displayed these statements while he was picketing Planned Parenthood. He took photographs of aborted fetuses and showed them to patients and potential patients. He also displayed these pictures of aborted fetus. These facts supported the conclusion the applicant was guilty of Professional misconduct. The Court would therefore seek a writ or order for particulars, costs and filing of an application for an order for prohibition."

The basis of the application is that the parties participated in a Collaborative Law process whereby it is alleged by the respondent that confidential information was shared. The respondent also relies on the provisions of the collaborative law agreement signed by the parties. HELD: 1) The conflict in the facts was apparent and was not resolved by additional evidence. 2) Mr. Sauer agreed to withdraw as counsel so the parties may proceed to pre-trial and a trial without the necessity of a viva voce hearing.,"FIAT: The applicant brings an application for a court order requiring the solicitor to withdraw as solicitor for the applicant. The basis of the application is that the parties participated in a Collaborative Law process whereby it is alleged that Mr. Therrien alleged that confidential information was shared. The applicant submits that it would be a conflict of interest for the solicitor, who has been retained by the applicant, to continue to represent her, as the issues have not been settled. The parties also agreed that it was the only way to resolve the conflicts, which would be by holding a viva voce hearing. HELD: The application is granted. The court ordered the withdrawal of the solicitor as counsel pursuant to the collaborative law agreement and ordered that the matter may proceed to pre-trial and a trial if necessary.

6_2007nsca73.txt,"At the time of the deceased's death, she held a bank account jointly with her daughter. Although the signature card signed when the account was opened could not be found for the hearing, the probate court relied on the evidence of the bank representative (who testified that she had the card when she closed the account and she was 100% sure that the account was a joint account and who was able to present to the court the form of the applicable account agreement) in determining that the monies in the joint account belonged to the daughter.  It was also found, on a strong balance of probabilities, that the deceased intended to make an inter vivos gift to her daughter and, alternatively, that the evidence rebutted any presumption of resulting trust in favour of the deceased or her estate. Another of the deceased's children appealed. Appeal dismissed; the probate court judge did not misapprehend the evidence, lack an evidentiary basis for his findings, rely upon incorrect legal principles or fail to apply or misapply the law.","At issue was the ownership of monies in a joint bank account in the names of the deceased and her children. The appellant and the respondents were children of the late Mrs. Scott. A probate court judge had found in 1993 that the deceased intended to make an inter vivos gift to the respondent, which she did. The respondent and her 10 children were children. When the respondent died, the funds in the joint account were subsequently turned over to the estate. The appellants appealed. Appeal dismissed; the probate judge did not find that any of the witnesses lacked credibility; the evidence was such that he did not have contradictory testimony before him. The standard of review applicable for all factual conclusions made by the trial judge was not palpable and overriding error. The same standard applies to questions of mixed law and fact, unless a question of fact is readily extricable when the standard will be that of correctness. The probate justice erred by making a determination when the evidence wasn't sufficient, and based only on speculation and hearsay rather than as required in law; and by not ruling on allegations of breach of trust and conflict of interest against the administratrix of the estate as required by law."
6_2011nssc48.txt,"The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building. The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions. Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income. Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue. When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs. The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries.","The plaintiff and her partner were in an apartment building when the fire broke out. The plaintiff fell from the building's third floor stairwell and suffered serious injuries. The defendant acknowledged that the fire alarm system in their building was not functioning at the time of the fire but that it was being maintained by the plaintiff and that the smoke alarm system was not working at the relevant time. The fire investigator testified that he had no prior knowledge of the alarm system not working and that tenants would not have had any warning as the doors on the third floor were continuously left in an open position. The smoke detector in the plaintiff's apartment system was found to be not functioning prior to the fire, there were problems with the fire engine, the fire alarms were not functioning properly, the smoke detector was not properly maintained, and the plaintiff suffered serious burns. The plaintiffs suffered serious injury from the fall. The defendants admitted they paid damages to the plaintiffs but denied they were caused by any act or omission by the defendant. Liability and damages at issue in this case. Although there was no evidence the defendant was responsible for the fire and the fire was not occurring at the correct time, the defendant's conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire and breached the plaintiff’s standard of care. The negligence of the defendant, as landlord, was a fundamental principle in determining damages. The common law duty of care arises from the proximity of the relationship between a landlord and tenants of its multi-unit residential building. In this case, the defendants owed a duty of caring to the plaintiff to ensure they were reasonably safe from injury while residing in the premises. In order to determine causation, the plaintiffs must demonstrate that the defendant breached the standard of cares and that damages were caused on a balance of probabilities. Liabilities and damages are at issue. The court found that the defendants breached the common law test by failing to maintain the hallway fire alarm systems, the inadequate installation of fire extinguishers, the failure to adequately monitor fire alarms and the fact that the plaintiff was unable to access the third and last floor without assistance from the fire department. The negligent conduct of the defendants was a material contribution to the damage and liability was imposed because it would offend basic notions of fairness and justice to deny liability by applying but for. The 'but for' test recognizes that compensation for negligent conduct should only be made 'where a substantial connection between the injury and the defendant’ s conduct is present'. The plaintiff”s damages would have been incurred on a case by case basis."
7_1996canlii6810.txt,"An application for an interim injunction restraining the Regina Exhibition Association (REAL) from interfering with GCB's enjoyment of certain leasehold premises in the Jubilee Building and from entering into any lease with Regina Central Bingo (RCBA) and preventing the operation of a bingo hall by RCBA within Exhibition Park except as sub-tenant of GCB. The original five year lease for use of the Jubilee Building as a bingo hall between Fundraising td. and REAL was assigned to GCB with REAL's written consent. GCB further sublet the building without REAL's consent or knowledge. Written notice of renewal was not sent to REAL. The basis of GCB's application was estoppel on the basis that REAL entered negotiations regarding a relocation of the bingo hall and then began to deal directly with CGB's sub-tenant after the renewal date had passed. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)There was no evidence that Fundraisers, the original party to the lease, attempted to exercise the option to renew. 2)GCB did not have a strong prima facie case on the merits. It appeared that there were no negotiations between GCB and REAL. 3)There would not be irreparable harm. Under the current arrangements, the bingo would be operated by RCBA. If successful at trial the damages to GCB can be easily calculated based on the time it was unable to occupy the premises. 4)On balance GCB failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the inconvenience it will suffer by the refusal of the injunction will be greater than that suffered by REAL if granted.","The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction restraining the applicant from entering into any lease with the respondent and permitting the operation of a bingo hall by the respondent except as a tenant. The applicant had entered into written agreements with the applicant for the day to day operation of the bingo halls and had advised the tenant it would advise the tenant of its position on a date well after the renewal option deadline. The respondent refused to provide written notice. The application was dismissed. The court found that the applicant had failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the plaintiff will suffer from the refusal of the injunction. The interlocututory injunction was not granted in the circumstances it would be inequitable to permit the landlord to rely on the failure to give written notice as required in the lease. On the contrary, the applicant failed to show that the inconvenience that the tenant will suffer by the refusal is greater than that which will be suffered by the defendant if the injunction is granted."
7_1998canlii13374.txt,"Associates, which held purchase money security interests pursuant to its 1997 leases, applied under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by Associates and Humboldt Flour Mills in two reefer trailers. Humboldt's security interests were acquired pursuant to a security agreement granted in 1996 on present and after acquired property as amended in 1998 to specifically include the trailers. It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute. Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease. Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.  6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly. To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air.","The respondent applied under s63 of the Personal Property Security Act for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by the respondent and Humboldt entitled to jointly finance the acquisition of two reefer trailers and directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. Humboldingt denied possession. The issue to be determined was what is meant by the term 'possession' in s34(2)(a) and when in thecircumstances of this case, Lake Air obtained possession orconstructive possession of the trailers within the meaning of s34. HELD: The application was allowed. It was ordered that its purchase-money security interests in the two trailers have priority to Humbolds' security interests. 1)The respondent did not haveconstructive custody prior to December 22, 1997 through either GJ Bell or Mid-Canada.  2)It was obvious that before December 22/97 the trailers were not in the physical possession of Lake Air. They were first in the possession of GJBell as vendor and then in the custody of Mid- Canada as installer. As well, the first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the respective trailers were delivered by Associates at the location and on the date set out in the lease. Such a clause was inconsistent with the submission that the respondent had actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. 3)The application was denied. It is ordered that the parties' purchase- money security interests have priority over each other's security interests therein.  4)The issue to determine was what was meant by 'possession' in ss34(1)(a), 'constructive' possession and when, in the circumstances of this particular case, the Lake Air acquired possession or constructive control of the trailer.  5)The wording of the provisions respecting possession and constructive possession were similar to those respecting possession of property."

The accused argued that the pre -trial publicity had prejudiced his right to be tried by an impartial jury of his peers. There was no evidence before the Court on the merits of the case as the trial had yet to begin. HELD: The application for a stayed of proceedings was dismissed. 1)The pre- trial publicity had not in any way prejudiced the accused's right to a fair trial by an unbiased jury. It was only at the stage that the trial could be reasonably expected to be held in which there would be an atmosphere of fear and terror. 2)The applicant had not established that his right had been violated on a balance of probabilities.  3)The application for stay of Proceedings based on the unprecedented amount of prejudicial pre-rial publicity was denied. 4)The Court was satisfied that the post-trial media publicity created an atmosphere that was impossible to detect at the time of its commencement. 5)The court was also satisfied that it would be impossible to determine whether the accused had been sexually assaulted by the accused at the hands of members of the Hells Angels motorcycle gang. 6)The applicants' position was that challenges for cause were desirable and the Court was permitted to challenge prospective jurors for cause."

He was seeking damages against the federal government for alleged abuses suffered while attending an Indian Residential School. The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support. HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel. The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property. The mother was awarded costs of the application set at $350.","The father was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $454 per month. Since the issuance of the order the father had been unemployed by reason of health problems and, as a result, arrears of child support were constantly accruing. HELD: In the event the father receives a settlement in a lawsuit against the Government of Canada involving his claim for abuse suffered at the Indian Residential School, the first $50,000 will be paid into Court with the exception of paying any legal fees and disbursements plus taxes owing to his solicitors. The settlement amount is to be paid within three days of the lawsuit being settled. In the meantime the father is to pay settlement proceeds into Court in accordance with the below order. In this case the father's counsel is to report to the court within three weeks of the litigation involving the claim being settled and the remaining $50k will be disbursed by the respondent's counsel. It is not offensive to direct that the respondent’s counsel, at the time of such settlement, if there is such settlement pay monies into Court.

She now stated that she was unable to return to work due to health problems, including irritable bowel syndrome, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. Both parties accused the other of conduct which diminished matrimonial assets. The wife's mother had advanced the parties a considerable amount of money during the marriage, with the final advance being the subject of an IOU. The husband is to be responsible for the matrimonial debts, with the net proceeds from the sale of matrimonial home to be paid ratably to those creditors; the wife is to receive 35% of the husband's pension entitlement; husband to pay spousal support in the amount of $1,000 per month for a period of ten years with the order open to variation if the wife obtains a C.P.P. disability pension or becomes fit to work or if the husband retires from the military or makes a proposal or an assignment in bankruptcy which has the effect of requiring the wife to pay any of the matrimonial debts.","The parties were married for more than a year and had not resumed cohabitation. The petitioner was a corporal in the Canadian Armed Forces and was in the second year of a three year contract. The respondent was a high school graduate and was working part-time as a cleaner. The parties had two children, aged eight and nine. The wife was working and living in the same apartment as the petitioner and claimed to have a normal life. She required a special diet and a specialised diet. She also required a strict dietary program. The husband withdrew significant amounts of money from his spouse's bank account in order to avoid having to pay matrimonial debts. The court found that the husband was not liable for the debts and, if he was, should be required to pay any of them. The evidence showed that the wife had an unreasonable impoverishment and that she did not want to perform any employment. The pension was not divided equally and the husband's contributions to the pension were not limited to the amount owing to the petitioner. The Court awarded the respondent $1,600 per month in spousal support and ordered the parties to divide the pension according to the criteria set out in the Act. The matrimonial debts were matrimony debts incurred during the cohabitating period. The deceased was a Grade 12 student and had completed high school. She earned $12,000 per year. The couple had two young children. The Postsecondary Education Certificate (PEC) was not issued. The Education Certificate was not an issue. The Certificate was a copy of the Education Certificate and the Education Act (AEC) and was signed by the husband. The affidavit filed by the sister also indicated that the Certificate was an appropriate instrument to be used to divide matrimonia assets. The Part II Certificate was also an appropriate device to be utilized in the trial. The present evidence does not support the claim that the petitioner is entitled to spousals or an obligation to pay back the outstanding debts."

The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act. The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3) The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues.","The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent. The applicant asks that the court has authority to order a subdivision of land outside the requirements of the Planning and Development Act. The respondent argues that the provisions of an agreement must, of necessity, be considered merged in conveyance. The appeal court held that at the time of the purported reservation of title in favour of the applicant, no subdivision of agricultural land was permitted in respect of an area less than five acres. The application in question was tantamount to a judicially ordered partition of land to avoid the effect of legislation. HELD: The appeal is allowed. 1) The respondent's position was to insist on the transfer of proposed parcel G, saying the corrals were a separate issue and he would deal with the school division once the land was transferred to him.  2) The School Division attempted to have all interested parties negotiate an agreement. The original transaction was concluded in 1996 conditional on subdivision approval which the Court was obliged to obtain at its own cost. The agreement was executed by Mr. Erker and the Kerrobert School Division. Mr. Klein opposed the application saying he was a bona fide purchaser with no notice of the Flads' interest and relied on the indefeasibility of his title.  3) The appeal was allowed on the basis of the factors set out in the Planning & Development Act, 1983.

He was suspended from the program since approximately March 2000. There have been a number of legal proceedings between the applicant and the University since then. An appeal committee of the University held that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency training on probationary terms. This decision has not been implemented. At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The applicant is such a student. His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended. The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. HELD: 1) The court found the College of Medicine has not been objectively reasonable in the exercise of its discretion to insist that the appeal committee decision will not be implemented until such time as the applicant obtains third party funding. The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts. 2) The applicant is entitled to relief. The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met. The applicant must enter into a written agreement with the College of Medicine whereby he agrees that the money he was paid while on suspension is prepayment for all of the services he will perform for the College of Medicine in the remainder of his residency, that he will not claim any salary or monetary benefits available to other medical residents pursuant to the PAIRS agreement, and he will indemnify the College of Medicine if it is required to make payments to him pursuant to the PAIRS agreement during the remainder of his residency program. Further, PAIRS will enter into an agreement with the College of Medicine waiving the financial terms of the PAIRS agreement with respect to the applicant for the duration of his residency. 3) The applicant will be responsible for paying tuition fees, administration fees, insurance fees and any other college fees payable by other medical residents but he will be granted a credit for the fees deducted by the College of Medicine during the time he was suspended.","At issue was a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The policy states that in order for a student to return to the college of medicine he must acquire third party funding. The student had been suspended from the program for five years. The College of Physicians and Surgeons appealed the suspension with pay and lost its appeal. The plaintiff now seeks judicial review. He asks that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. 1) The College's policy is that all trainees must be funded by sources approved by the Postgraduate Medical Education Committee. The Court of Appeal has not upheld the decision to place the student on probation. 2) The applicant's third party sponsorship is depleted during the period of his suspension. The applicant must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The University insists he must find another sponsor prior before being allowed back to the program.  3) The plaintiff has not yet exhausted his appeals within the internal laws of the University. Jurisdiction to determine fairness of administration goes beyond traditional legal supervisory or appellate jurisdiction. Juried law, which is to say that systemic forces were at work beyond the control of a student, was not the subject of this particular policy. The fact that the student's funding had been prepaid allowed for the suspension. Funding on an annual basis would have obviated the problem. Jurious jurisdiction to determine the fairness of the administration goes far beyond traditional supervisory/ appellate jurisdiction, which means the applicant was premature in applying to the visitor with respect to this matter, and was not required to participate in the appeal process. Juridical jurisdiction extends beyond the traditional supernumerary resident policy. A decision to impose a probationary period on a student who has not completed his probationary term would have resulted in a serious breach of the College's funding policy regarding supernumbary residents. The court has not determined the appropriate period of time. 4) The Court has not established the scope of the jurisdiction to assess if the internal rules or laws have been properly and fairly applied. The facts are too new to be considered in this context. The application falls to be determined on whether it is reasonable for the College to insist on a third-party funding order before he will be permitted to resume the program on a probationar period. The administration of justice will be satisfied by the results of the appeal proceedings. 5) The court is not in a"
7_2006nspc61.txt,"A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference. The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence. Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present. Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","The accused appeared before a youth court and entered or confirmed guilty pleas to 31 offences involving assaultive behaviour, threats, property damage and breach of court orders in relation to group home placements. The accused appeared to be of the view that her mental health and rehabilitation issues were the cause of her offending. The Crown and the youth court sought a ruling from the court as to whether the public, including the media, should be permitted to attend the pre-sentencing conference. The attending youth court was advised that information and records discussed during the conference were confidential. The applicant applied to exclude the public and the media from the conference. Application granted; the court ordered that the conference be held prior to the sentencing hearing. The purpose of the conference was to provide recommendations on a sentence for the accused. Although a parent is not a party to the proceedings, the court must expect the public to be present and to be able to advise the court on the best practices for addressing the young person's mental health issues and to assist the court in reaching the right conclusion on the appropriate sentence for her. The court found that the public should be encouraged to participate in the sentencing process as it is a public forum and is open to the public."
7_2006nssc131.txt,"The deceased's cousin commenced an action for nervous shock after she observed the accident in which the deceased bicyclist was killed. Since the defendant was an uninsured motorist, the Facility Association defended the plaintiff's action against him; however, the plaintiff also brought an action against the insurer of a motor vehicle policy under which the deceased was insured. At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff. The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.","The plaintiff, a cousin of the deceased, commenced an action to recover damages for nervous shock after being hit from behind by a vehicle. The defendant, an uninsured motorist, was charged with the offence. The plaintiff commenced the action claiming negligence against the defendant, who was an uninsured driver. The defendants settled the claim for nervous shocks after the plaintiff commenced it. The Court concluded that the emotional harm suffered by the plaintiff was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties. The Plaintiff's Section D coverage did not extend to her claim. The Defendants agreed to liability for the emotional injury and the plaintiff's claim was settled. The court reviewed the various insurance policies and found that the Section D provisions of the M/V insurance policy issued by the defendant extend to protect a person who suffered a psychic injury as a result of the 'injury or death' of the defendant; an 'insured person' under the policy; and an 'insurance person' (other than the defendant). It is not the result that the plaintiff would have been required to sue only one defendant to obtain full recovery. It is instructive and in keeping with the case law that a claim for damages surviving under the Fatal Injuries Act does not include a claim that emotional distress must be piggybacked on the bodily injury or death of the person insured."

HELD: Application allowed.  1) The parties agree that the rent for July was paid on July 27. The landlord then immediately applied for and was granted a writ of possession. 2) The tenants advise that the landlord holds the equivalent of one month's rent as security for the payment of the last month rent of the tenancy. The landlord claims it is a security deposit. 3) The tenants claim they tendered the arrears on the basis that the landlord would not apply for a writ of possession and that the arrears were accepted on that basis. 4) The Court of Queen's Bench Chambers judge dismissed the appellant's appeal the same day saying 'the rent for August has not been paid and not paid by required time, appeal is dismissed'. 5) The first issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in finding the Rentalsman had jurisdiction to make the order granting possession on the basis that 'the rent was 15 days in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice' if the landlord accepted the rent in lieu of seeking a writ of possession. The second issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid.","The tenants applied for leave to appeal a decision of the Queen's Bench reviewing a decision the Deputy Rentalsman granted them. The tenants alleged they tendered the arrears on the basis that the landlord would not apply for a writ of possession and that the arresars were accepted on that basis. Because the tenants believed the landlord holds the equivalent of one month's rent as security for the payment of the last month's rental, they indicated they would not have tendered it if they were going to be evicted in any event. The landlord was granted a writof possession and issued leave to file an appeal book and factum. If the tenants do not appear by 4:00 p.m. on August 31/2006 but do not pay the August rent by the end of August 31, or do not vacate the premises in September, the landlord has leave to apply on 48 hours notice to lift any stay of execution.

Based on the applicant's income, his child support payment is reduced from $500 per month to $425 per month.  2) The applicant is in arrears in the amount of $56,365.60.

Mr. McLaughlan has properly proceeded under The Inter-Jurisdiction Support Orders (ISSU) Act in light of his residence and the fact that the original order was made pursuant to provincial as opposed to federal legislation. 2) The applicant appears to be suggesting that his payment of ongoing support, and any payment he must make towards arrear, leaves him in financial difficulties, given he has remarried and has two more children. However, in order to allow rescission, would have to determine he has, firstly, present inability to pay arrearn and, secondly, that he will not in the future be able to pay the arreared. 3) Given that Mr. McClaughlan is currently earning the sum of $45,784 per year, he can afford to pay a reasonable payment towards the outstanding arrerears."
7_2007skqb28.txt,"The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code. At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made. The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) and driving while over.08 contrary to ss. 253B of the Criminal Code. The Crown appealed the acquittal on the charge under s.253(b) of the Code. HELD: The Court held that the delay between the time the respondent was stopped and when the roadside screening demand was made took the demand outside of the 'forthwith' requirement of s. 254(2) of s.(1) of The Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained Shire in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of Shire's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search without a warrant was not reasonable and the accused's right to free speech was violated. The evidence obtained from the roadside demand was excluded under s.(2) s.(3) of S.Ct. 607. The Court concluded that the police officers who responded to a complaint of squealing tires and possible drinking should have been aware of the source of the alcohol and therefore made a screening demand. The roadside demand in this case was not made in a random vehicle stop and the officer reasonably believed that he would be issuing a ticket under the Alcohol and Drugs and Substances Act."

That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","The respondent was granted an order pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act, 2007, SS 2007, P-13.2 requiring him to comply with a number of conditions, including that he had to remove all junk cars and abandoned vehicles from his property, and that he could not afford to store them elsewhere. The respondent applied for an order declaring him in contempt of court for his failure to comply within 60 days of the order being made. The applicant applied for the order which was the subject of these contempt proceedings. The application was initially heard September 25, 2014 but was subsequently heard October 1, 2014 and November 13, 2015. The matter was adjourned to May 11, 2015 and the matter was then remitted to February 2, 2015 with the court to determine the appropriate penalty or sanction to be imposed by the court. HELD: The Court was satisfied that the respondent had not shown any reasonable excuse for his initial failure to compliance with the orders nor for his repeated failures to complete the purging of his contempt. The Court ordered the respondent to pay solicitor and client costs of $15,000.00. The court ordered specific damages for the respondent and sought specified amounts of money to be paid in accordance with the order. The defendant was to appear in court on February 2nd, 2015 to provide an affidavit outlining his reasons for not complying with the Orders. The judge also ordered the defendant to pay costs to the plaintiff. The plaintiff will also be responsible for his own legal fees."
7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","The defendant was found guilty of the second degree murder of his common law spouse, who was his former common law wife. The evidence implicating the defendant in the murder was from the testimony of two former common laws spouses, Susan Saxon and Dwight Windrum. The trial judge did not give a Vetrovec warning to either spouse, but instead asked the defendant to give it to the jury in relation to the testimonyof Ms. Saxon, Ms. Windrum and Mr. Saxone. The defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; defendant sentenced to life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for 12 years; defendant given no reasons for his decision not to give the warning. The exchange between the trial judge and the Crown and defence lawyer over the course of the pre-charge conference was instructive in giving a strong indication that the defendant's evidence is unreliable and that his reasons for seeking to use it were not the only ones to affect the credibility of the witnesses."

The police officer had responded to a call in connection with a disturbance during which the appellant assaulted a third person. Upon arriving at the scene the officer recognised the appellant as someone wanted by the police. The officer told the appellant that he was under arrest because of two outstanding warrants. The appellant assaulted the officer. The officer did not give evidence as to the grounds for his belief that the warrants met the s. 495(1)(c) Criminal Code requirement, i.e., that they were in a format set out in Part XXVIII and in force within the jurisdiction. In his charge to the jury the trial judge indicated that the arrest was for the assault against the third party and did not direct the jury to consider if the officer had reasonable grounds for believing that there were warrants outstanding. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the evidence did not support the conclusion that the officer arrested the appellant for the assault on the third party and it was not made clear to the jury that they must make an essential determination if the officer had reasonable grounds as required in s. 495 of the Code, such that he was acting in the execution of his duty.","The appellant appealed his conviction following a trial in the Supreme Court before a jury on a charge that he did assault a police officer engaged in the execution of his duties contrary to s. 270(2)(a) of the Criminal Code. The police had responded to a disturbance call and found a person who was wanted by the police. When the police asked the person his name, the person gave a fictitious one. The appellant gave a police report to the police which was confirmed by the evidence. The officers responded to another disturbance call which was heard by the occupants of a residence nearby. The complainant confronted the police officer and kicked him hard in the abdomen. The two offences for which the warrants were issued and an offence arising out of the disturbance on LaHave Street were both charges for the police constable. The Crown appealed the conviction. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge mischaracterized the Code as requiring a police constigator to have reasonable and probable grounds on which to base the arrest. The constable was clearly involved in the duty investigating the disturbance. The Court noted that there were outstanding warrants directed to a peace officer in the province of Nova Scotia and that the Crown was entitled to make this arrest without a warrant. The officer was lawfully arresting the person who assaulted the complainant. Pursuant to s686(1)(a), s6(2) ofthe Code, the constable had the requisite grounds for belief in the offences for committal and assault causing bodily harm. The trial judge instructed the jury that they must make the essential determination whether the officer was in the Execution of his duty, in making the arrest, the reasonable grounds referred to in s. 495 of the Code."

The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing, that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record. In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial. As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons.","The respondent hotel manager appealed three orders of the Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia) ordering her to reinstate the individual respondents, to pay them compensation and to reconsider the first two orders. The hotel was owned by hotel employees. The union alleged that the respondent was trying to intimidate its employees to compel them to refrain from being members of a trade union. The Union alleged that in the absence of proper reasons for decisions made, the respondent's employees were being treated as being in danger of being deported. The respondent refused to comply with the orders and the Board ordered the hotel to reinstatement the individual employees and to pay compensation to the union. All five of the respondents did not appear at the appeal. The court reviewed the factors set out in R. v. Burns (1994), 165 N. R. 374 (S.C.A.). It concluded that the Board was not bound by legislation to provide reasons for its decisions and that in fact, in the circumstances the decision-makers (the decision makers) gave no assurance that the ultimate decision-maker, in fact considered the applicant's submissions directly. The Court concluded that this finding was not patently unreasonable. In recent years, with the development of multitude of tribunals with varying degrees of protection from judicial review, it has become fashionable for such tribunalals to give reasons for their decisions. In many jurisdictions, the giving of reasons is now required by statute. In this case the giving is not patented. It is merely an attempt to provide a clear and satisfactory reason for the decision. The reasons given are not required by law."

The sole ground of appeal relates to the failure of the Provincial Court judge to advise the appellant of his rights to trial by French or English pursuant to Section 530(2) of The Criminal Code and the fact that the trial judge did not advise him of his Rights to trial In French is a procedural error.

He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.","FIAT: The child support order of December 11, 1991 was registered in this Court January 27, 1992 pursuant to the Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, 1983. Under that order the petitioner was to pay ongoing child support of $300 per month. Arrears accumulated and he sought to expunge them. The petitioner is part of a family farm operation. He supplements his farm income with working for part of the season at a local sporting store. This generates some rental income. The respondent takes the position the petitioner's line 150 income does not reflect his ability to pay and that by reporting a farm loss each year the petitioner pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. HELD: The respondent is not prepared to rescind any of the arrears. Arreears have accumulated and the petitioner seeks to expune them. Arrebars have accrued and he is paying less tax than he will otherwise pay; the petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further the court is not willing to impute income. Arrez have accumulated. The court was cognizant of the fact the petitioner’s farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farmer loss each yr the petitioner in fact pays less taxed on his income than is otherwise pay in the circumstances. Arrogars have accumulate and he seeks to abrogate them. He is paying at a rate greater than his legal obligation. Arrettes have accumulated; he is expunging them. There is money sitting in the Maintenance Enforcement Office as result of federal intercept."
8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch and filed with the Court of Queen's Bench. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. HELD: The Court has jurisdiction to set aside the certificate. 1) Does this Court have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a true appeal that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. 2) There are at least two bases upon which it can be found that it can reasonably be found the Court is clothed with jurisdiction to exercise its discretion and provide remedy in appropriate circumstances. There are, in the case of adjudicator appeals, at least 2 bases uponwhich it can been found that the Court can exercise its discretionary and provide a remedy in any circumstances. 3) There is no evidence that an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board or an appeal to the Court's Appeals Board is a true appeals. What has been tendered as the basis for the exercise of this Court's discretion is an explanation that the handwritten letter to the Labour standards officer (and not the registrar of appeals) was sufficient compliance, even though at that time the Director's wage assessment had not yet been completed. The Court must have jurisdiction in the circumstances to set up a director's certificate. 4) The Court does have jurisdiction on an applicant’s request, a director’’appeal’, because of the length of the hearing and the time limitation between appeal and hearing. The court was satisfied that the discussion occurred as stated in the affidavits of the labour standards officers. 5) The applicant did not chose to ignore the plain language on the document. This, at the very least, amounts to wilful blindness. In numerous cases wilful blameworthyness has been held to not constitute sufficient reason to set off a director by statute. 6) The court has jurisdiction in situations where a director appeals are a true appealed that questions the decision made of an independent judge after a Hearing. The reasoning of the Court in Farmers of North America is not applicable to these circumstances.

HELD: The Court reviewed the facts and found the tenant had not raised any true issues as to the jurisdiction of the hearing. It was the Court's view that the hearing officer had jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter in issue. The notice of appeal and arguments presented by the tenant all relate to the facts as found by the hearing officer and contain no error of law. There were facts before the hearing officer to support his finding that the tenant had significantly disturbed other tenants. Further, the Court found there was ample evidence to support the hearing officer's decision on all his findings of fact. Appeal dismissed.","An appeal pursuant to s. 72 of The Residential Tenancies Act from a decision of a hearing officer appointed under the Act, who, pursuant to ss. 58, 68 and 70 of the Act ordered that the landlord be given possession of the tenant's rental unit and that a writ of possession be issued to place the landlord in possession of it. The grounds for the application were that the tenant had unreasonably disturbed other tenants within the meaning of ss. 68(2)(a)(i) of the act and that the College had called the police. The College applied for possession of possession of its rental unit. The tenant appealed the decision of the hearing officer. The material available for review was limited to the notice of appeal from the decision by the hearing officers and the decision on the hearing hearing officer and the finding of the officer that the tenants had unre unreasoningly disturbed other tenant. HELD: The tenant's appeal was dismissed significantly on the basis that the findings of fact were not supported by the findings to the contrary. There was evidence that the police were called for the landlord and the College were evicted from the noise and trouble started from the landlord. The applicant had unreasonsably disturbed the other tenants in the meaning the 68(1)(a) and 68(3)(a(i) sections of the legislation provide the right of appeal to the hearing director from the time of the decision. There were also findings of law to support the finding that the applicant had disturbed other occupants within the meanings of ss68(2(a)(a); the fact that the college had a writ to place in possession was not significantly reduced on the fact of fact. The fact that all the tenants' notices of appeal except for the tenant were dismissed were also significantly reduced in their findings to that of fact and was not supported on appeal by the officer's decision. The tenants appealed on the evidence that police were calling for the Landlord and that my doctor thinks or the Rentalsman claims I'm mentally ill.

8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).",The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking contrary to S. 145(3) of the Code. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused was convicted of assault with a weapon and breach an undertaking. The evidence did not meet the statutory requirements of a dangerous offenders designation and the long-term offender designation was the appropriate finding with a term of imprisonment from four to eight years in penitentiary for the predicate offence followed by lengthy supervision order toward the statutory maximum. The predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the criminal Code.
8_2015skqb6.txt,"HELD: This was an extraordinary event for all of the accused and nothing in the evidence suggested that they required rehabilitation or that incarceration would assist in rehabilitation. The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him. The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years. The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth. The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge. All accused were given an 18-month probation period to follow their incarceration. Terms of the probation included counselling as required and no contact with the victim.","HELD: The Court sentenced the three accused pursuant to s. 267(b) and s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code to imprisonment for common assault. The Court found that the three had acted in good faith and were at low risk to re-offend. The offences occurred over a period of 13 days. The three accused admitted to the offence, and gave a statement to the police shortly after their arrest. They were assessed as being at medium risk to reapply for the offence. The accused also admitted to having a pellet gun in their possession. The Crown sought a DNA order, a firearms prohibition and a forfeiture order in relation to the imitation firearm. The first accused was sentenced to 12 days imprisonment. The second accused was given a sentence of 1 year to 18 months. The sentences were varied but the offences occurred quickly and intensely. The third accused, who had a previous criminal record for driving while over.08, had been in custody for 13 days prior to his arrest. The offence was considered a fit for imprisonment."
8_2016skqb154.txt,"HELD: The order was granted. Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care. Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","HELD: The court found that the children had made a remarkable turnaround and that their parents, both of them foster parents, were genuinely committed to their welfare. The Ministry had taken an active interest in the children for almost three years. The mother had no contact with the children prior to writing the letters to the court. The father had been in the foster parents' home for approximately two years. They had been involved in their home life, their school life and their treatment with the mother. The children had been exposed to violent and sexual acts by their father. The parents had been unable or unwilling to provide for their children's needs and physical harm was likely to occur to them. The child protection worker was retained by the Ministry to complete a parenting capacity assessment report. She was involved in setting up the visits. The court concluded that the parents had not taken sufficient steps to deal with their anger, violence and alcohol issues. The evidence showed that the father had taken no measurable steps to address his anger, aggression and alcohol problems. The Court concluded that these children were in need of protection and that permanent protection was in their best interests."

Yellow Quill First Nation applied for intervenor status. The trial judge found, without giving reasons, that the project was a development as defined in the Environmental Assessment Act and the application for mandamus was adjourned sine die. HELD: The appeal was granted and the order set aside without costs. 1)The proposal was not a development as defined in s 2(d) of the EAA. The Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Environment and Resource Management were of the opinion that the KSS project was not a development as defined in the Act as it did not come within any of the criteria listed in s2(d). 2)The Environmental Assessment Branch was of the opinion that no significant impacts on the environment would occur or if they do, mitigation measures would be implemented to reduce or eliminate the potential for significant environmental impact.  3)It was not necessary to decide whether Yellow Quill or the respondents had standing to privately enforce a public right. 4)In light of the decision the following were not in issue: whether the respondent should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari; the relationship between the Environmental Assessment and Agricultural Operations Act; and whether a proponent of an intensive livestock operation can be required to make an application under the Agricultural Operations Act and to carry out an environmental impact assessment under s9 of the EAA.","The respondents applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for an order compelling the applicant Department of Agriculture to conduct an environmental assessment pursuant to s. 9 of The Environmental Assessment Act. The second issue on the appeal was whether the project was a development as defined by s. 2(d) of the Act. HELD: The application was granted. The chambers judge did not allow the use of affidavits filed by the respondents on an application for final order as he was not required to do so. The majority of the facts deposed to in the affidavits were based on conjecture, speculation and hearsay with no basis in fact. The court found that the proposal was not a development under s.2(d). The respondents requested an order for mandamus compelling the KSS to conduct environmental assessment as required by s9 of the Environmental Assessment act. The KSS project did not seek costs. 1)The Court found that KSS was not developing as defined in s. 3(d), of the The Environmental assessment Act. 2)The KSS proposal was found not a developing as required under s2(D) of The Assessment Act because the project or operation was not development under the Act and the statutory requirements necessary to constitute this project had not been satisfied. 3)The application of HL Pork Producers Ltd. requesting intervenor status was not necessary. 4)The respondents were awarded costs. 5)The court did not permit the use by the respondent of affidavit evidence taken at their highest probative value.  6)The affidavit evidence filed by both parties was admitted. 7)The respondent did not request costs. 8)The issue of costs was whether or not the respondent should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari to set aside the order of the Minister of Agriculture as opposed to applying for declaration that the project is development under The Environmental assessments. The statutory requirements for a declaration that an intensive livestock operation is a development were not satisfied. It was not unnecessary to consider whether the respondents or the respondents have standing to privately enforce a public right."

The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest. The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means. In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care. Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.","The applicant sought 13 orders of production for documents prepared by and in the possession of her service providers. The Minister was requesting the records as part of a protection proceeding. The applicant argued that this was a high threshold for a protection application, and that the documents would not be able to be produced because of their complexity and complexity. Application dismissed; the court found that the requirements of the protection order were high and that obtaining the records would not save costs. The court also found that it would not accept the applicant's repeated requests for documents as proof of the Protection Finding; the records were not relevant to the applicant’s present circumstances and would not assist in the preparation of the parental capacity assessment. The requirement to obtain the records, which must be obtained by means other than obtaining a Order of Production, was not a high priority."

With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday. This order was granted at trial. The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care. HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period. JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court. This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits. CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months. During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return. TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program. KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR. 1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. 2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs. The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. 3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time. KS has quit drinking. TK is now employed. KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction. The parents have a residence. TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health. DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time. TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children. The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser. The success of the involvement of DCR in the life of this family would be enhanced with the assignment of another worker.","The Department of Community Resources seeks orders pursuant to The Child and Family Services Act placing the respondent with the Department until age 18, and placing the child with his grandmother as a Person of Sufficient Interest pursuant to s. 37(1)(b).

The Department of Child andFamily Services seeks orders under The Child & Family Services act placing the appellant with the Minister until age 16, but in view of the appellant's stated intention to return to his parents' home on his 16th birthday, which was granted at trial.

She ultimately decided to continue representing herself. The trial commenced June 26, 2006 and concluded September 29, 2006. The issues are: 1) whether the children are properly placed in the custody of the Minister; 2) whether there is a reasonable risk of physical harm to the appellant if the administration of justice determines that the appellant is in need of protection; 3) whether an order for custody of these children should be made in light of the evidence before the Court in respect to the Apprehension hearing. The child who is the respondent in this case is 11 years old and in Grade 8. The Court found that the child who was the respondent to the apprehension hearing was 12 years old or more. The parties agreed that the Court would consider the best interests of the children if they were placed in their care, and that the administration would consider information as to the respondent's treatment compliance from her mental health professionals and mental health facilities. The court found that 11 years of age and the respondent was 11 years, if the Court had a reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant had a psychiatric illness and that if the child was truly in need for protection, the Court ordered that the children remain in the respondent’s care until the age of 18.

9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","Dr. Huerto appealed from a Queen's Bench ruling that the Government had not used the AU code to regulate his practice. He argued that because the billing code was not in accordance with the physician payment schedule, the application of the AU coding did not amount to a 'payment schedule' uniquely applicable to him. The appeal court found that both the appeal and the cross-appeal must be dismissed. Both appeals and the appeal appeal are based on the principles of the Protocol and the principles outlined in the Medical Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an individualized administrative process and the aspects of the protocol which deal with the AU codes are not inconsistent with the payment schedule. The principles of that Protocol and MCIA are best characterized by the use of the standard definition of 'payment pattern' and the use by the Government of the code is not an attempt to regulate the practice by the government. Rather, it was designed to facilitate the payment of physician services by providing services in a manner unique to the physician."

The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest.","The accused, a young person, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code. Prior to being remanded, the accused was attending a youth centre where he also attended substance abuse and anger management programs. The accused was convicted of the charge, but had a previous record of violent offences. The victim of the shooting said he had been asked to leave the high school he had previously attended as a concern for his and other students' safety after threats had been made against him. The youth centre student appealed his sentence, arguing that his release from custody would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice. Application for release pending appeal dismissed; the accused applies for release from detention pending appeal. The Court of Appeal has a discretion to release the accused pending appeal and under the provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act it is not in the public interest to release him pending appeal; however, given the circumstances of the aggravated assault offence, his record of Violent offences, and the numerous breaches of court orders, release pending appeals is not the best option. The onus is on an appellant under s. 679(4)(a) of S. 671(4) of C.J.A. to establish under s.(1) the serious nature of the offence, the serious form of the offences, the nature of his criminal record, the reasons for sentence given by the judge, the principles of the Y.C.J., the preamble and the declaration of principles are to be considered in determining a release pending appealed."
9_2012skpc49.txt,"The accused plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault. The victims were his granddaughters. The assaults were alleged to have occurred between 1983 and 1991. A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts. The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.","The accused entered guilty pleas to three charges. The first two were sexual assaults. The accused claimed to have been touched by the accused in his sleep. The third was digital penetration. The evidence of the victims was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there was digital penetrative sexual assault. The Crown sought a sentencing hearing pursuant to s. 724(3)(e). The accused agreed to have the hearing and the three aggravating factors (digital penetration, skin on skin contact and digital penetration) determined. HELD: The Court was satisfied beyond areasonable doubt that both victims were sexually assaulted by the defendant on numerous occasions. The Court could not find that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just over their clothing, and there was no evidence of digital penetration by the alleged perpetrators. The second aggravating factor was that the alleged victims did not recall the specific incidents. The alleged assaults were repeated and repeated over a number of years. The defence argued that the offences could be categorized as sexual assaults but the Court was not satisfied that the counts were repeated. The court was not convinced that the allegations were new and the frequency of the assaults varied. The two victims described only a couple of incidents. They could not recall exactly what time they visited the accused. The symptoms of the sexual assault were mild and not related to normal daytime activities. The victims described being in the laundry area and being in his presence. The sexual assaults occurred over several years. HOLD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. The facts were sufficiently credible, beyond a reasonably reasonable doubt, that the sexual assaults were regular occurrences and that the repeated assaults were a common occurrence. The three aggravations were: 1) the accused had touched the victim directly on the skin and under their clothing; 2) the alleged contact was digital; 3) the evidence of both victims was sufficient to prove that the defendant took every chance he could to get more. The only conclusion that the Court could make was that these sexual assaults happened over a long period of time and that these victims recalled events over a few years."

The appellant also argued that the trial judge erred in preferring the evidence of the Crown's witness over his own. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.

The finding of the trial judge that the appellant must have known an accident had taken place before entering the store is contrary to the preponderance of evidence.

The guarantor, who had been previously a guarantor under the Mortgagee Act, had previously been a defendant in the proceedings. Prenoran sought a judgment against all three defendants. The plaintiff brought an application for a deficiency judgement against the guarantors. The chambers judge held that the application could not succeed because the order of October 17, 1991 extending the time from the time within which an application could be made was not one the prothonotary had power to give.

In assessing pecuniary damages, the court accepted the defendant's expert evidence which led to the conclusion the plaintiffs businesses were marginally profitable. The defendants were ordered to pay $30,000 as real, net loss of future income. The court approved a 5% capitalization rate as being appropriate where there was an eight year term to age 65.

As a result of the arbitration award, several lieutenants were demoted to the rank of firefighter. Denying the stay, that (1) there was no arguable issue to be tried on appeal; (2) there was no evidence the applicants would suffer irreparable harm if the stay were not granted; (3) the balance of convenience weighed against the applicants; and (4) there were no exceptional circumstances.","The applicants applied to have the arbitrator's award for 1989 demoted lieutenants set aside on the basis that the employer had failed to act in accordance with the terms of the collective agreement. The union alleged that the demoted liedutenants were acting in an acting capacity until a new routine was devised. The employer sought to use inexperienced personnel as lieutenant. The applicants filed an application for an order setting aside the arbitration award. The Union opposed the award, arguing that the notice went out to the union president indicating that up to fifty fire fighters would be moved within the fire department every two years. The applicant argued that this was based upon the fact that the union had not retained any experienced lieutenancy who had participated in the 1989 demotion. Application for stay granted; the union's position that the decision to allow the demoting lieutenancies to return to their positions was correct; the employer's position was that they were acting as lieutants until a proper new routine had been devised. While the union opposed the use of inexperienced personnel, the employer was aware that such personnel had been used in the past and it was reasonable to expect that they would not be used in an interim capacity. The concern with respect to using inexperienced personnel had dissipated if not entirely disappeared, at least in the short run. The present directions with respectto the utilization of the demote lieutenans in their present positions were adhered to and the court was bound to follow them."

b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","An appeal from an application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend after a motor vehicle accident occurred. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff was on company business and was driving his wife's Honda because his company car had a deflated tire. At issue was whether the chambers judge erred in his determination of which insurer was obligated to defend and whether the trial judge erered in his application of the principles of contract interpretation when he decided the Honda was not a 'temporary substitute automobile' within the terms of the Royal policy. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No matter the scope of the inquiry the judge hearing the application for instructions may engage in, the insurer is under no obligation toDefend. 2)The chambers judge did not raise any material issue that would raise a different issue. He simply said in response to the respondent's argument that the standard suggestion by the defendant was 'off target.' 3)The duty to defend arises only when the pleadings disclose a claim which, if proven at trial, would be covered by provisions in the insurance policy. When the provisions of the policy are 'ambiguous' or clearly do not provide coverage for that which is alleged in the pleadINGS, the applicant has no duty toDefence. 4)The Court concluded that the chambers decision was correct and that the proper focus should be on the claim and not on the insurer's view of the possible outcome. 5)The requirement to defend within the meaning of the'reasonable possibility' of exclusionary provision in the policy is not a sufficient reason to deny coverage to an individual where the claim is clearly beyond the scope the policy has an obligation of defending. 6)The Chamber judge's finding that the claim could fall within the coverage of the duty to protect was not an error but rather one that was consistent with the broad application of a duty to defence in the circumstances of the case."

HELD: 1) The children were to have joint custody with their paternal grandparents. The respondent was to pay child support of $31,800 per month. He was to have reasonable access on alternate weekends. The children would have access on any Friday that is not attached to his access weekend, except when the respondent is working. 2) The petitioner had to be more flexible than the respondent. The parties could not demonstrate an ability to co-parent more effectively. The court accepted the characterization that the parents were very good parents. They were both somewhat responsible for the breakdown in communication and ultimate inability of the parties to show more flexibility. The father bore the larger share of the responsibility for breakdown in communications and ultimate failure of the parents to show greater flexibility. 3) The child support was to be shared equally. 4) The respondent bore the greater share of responsibility for the lack of communication. The parents were to work more hours and were to communicate more effectively (ex. childcare). 5) The father was to designate one day per week as designated by the Maintenance Enforcement Office for two weekends. 6) The mother was to make an application to the Court of Appeal for an order respecting the custody of the two boys. The Court was to consider whether the child constitutes matrimonial property. The mother's request to have more frequent Internet access was insufficient. The child's needs were met. The parenting pattern was consistent with the parties' ability to communicate effectively. They both demonstrated insensitivity to each other's needs and showed a lack of sensitivity. The fact that the parties had not demonstrated a willingness to compromise was not accepted. The evidence showed that the father was insistent on greater contact with his children. It was not appropriate to compromise. The two parents demonstrated a level of sensitivity that was appropriate for a situation such as this. The courts were to order an order accordingly."
b_1999skqb39.txt,HELD: The grandparents were granted access one Saturday every second month from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. It would be in the best interests of the child to have some ongoing relationship with both his maternal and paternal grandparents. The father lived in Alberta and may not be able to exercise the degree of access he was seeking. The relationships were separate with unique characteristics.,"The paternal grandparents sought an order granting them access to their grandson, R.D.G., born December 1995 pursuant to s. 6.1(1) of the Children's Law Act, 1997. The applicants, the paternal grandparents, sought an Order granting them unrestricted access to his grandson, P.J.B., born January 1995 pursuant pursuant to ss. 6(1)(1) and s. 7(1). The paternal grandparents opposed the access and suggested that any access being exercised by the applicants should be exercised during the access periods granted to their son, P.(J.J.)B. HELD: The paternal grandfathers were granted access to the child's grandson, who was born December [96], 1995 pursuantto s.6.1 of the children's law act, 1997, S.S. 1997. 1) The Court was not satisfied that it was appropriate to link the access of the paternal grandmothers with that of the child, and their relationship was separate relationships with unique characteristics to each of them. 2) The access was reduced to one Saturday every two months.  3) The respondent was to fix each access period two months in advance."
b_2000skqb36.txt,"The accused, Cote, applied for remedy pursuant to s.24 of the Charter of Rights stating that he was denied the right to be tried on a fraud charge within a reasonable time. Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay. Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.","The accused was committed to stand trial on one of the fraud charges and shortly after the swearing in of the new Chief, the Crown made another demand for disclosure. The accused sought further disclosure.HELD: The application was based primarily on the accused's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time. The Court found that just over 22 months had passed since the laying of the fraudulent charge and the scheduled trial date of February 28, 2000. The Crown acknowledged that the delay had been substantial and sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay. The facts establish that the accused was not only delayed but also suffered an unnecessary additional 9 months of unemployment, economic hardship and other prejudice in the form of embarrassment from the numerous media reports of the charges but also from the prejudice occasioned by the delay in bringing the accused to trial."
b_2000skqb420.txt,"FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty. In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.  1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure. 2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.  3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence. It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt. His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","FIAT. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the plaintiffs claimed resulted from the actions of the defendant. The defendant was employed by the plaintiff's officer to provide a contingency basis for payment. The plaintiffs' action against the defendant was brought to trial and all of the claims were dismissed. The defendants' officer brought an application pursuant to Rule 483 for summary judgment under Part Forty. The applicant brought an action against that officer and the defendant on the basis that the officer had assured the plaintiff that he would protect the plaintiff with interest if the plaintiff refused to settle. The officer's affidavit was objected to in particular portions of the affidavit that referenced the word protect. HELD: The portions of an affidavit were struck. The only conclusion that can be drawn from the facts is that the respondent guaranteed the payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. The addition of the word 'protect' puts the question beyond doubt. The portions were all directed to the respondent without objection. 1) The only conclusions that can can be derived from the fact is that that the defendant guaranteed the Payment of the Applicant's account Regardless of the outcomes of their Mutual Client's actions (e.g. if the defendant settles before trial with the plaintiff, the result of the settlement will not be reached sooner than later) is that there is a conflict in the evidence as well as the evidence in chief. 2) The plaintiff commenced its action under the General Rules but subsequently amended its claim on April 26, 2000 to continue the action under Simplified Procedure Rules (Part Forty). 3) The court was struck."
b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither the accused nor the complainant had any memory of the sexual intercourse that took place between them. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1) The Court had broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication. The Court reviewed the cases that dealt with the issue of the accused's belief in the truthfulness of consent and found that such a defence was not available in those circumstances. 2) The defence of 'extreme drunkenness' was successful in the rarest of cases. The accused testified that he was so intoxicated that he could not remember anything before the sexual assault took place and he never considered the issue if the complainant was incapable of consenting. The facts were very different from those in the case before and the Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of such a behaviour was not advanced on the basis of punishment. 3) The accused raised three potential defences. He questioned the validity of s. 33.1. He challenged the validity and reliability of the complainant's denial of consent, or honest belief in consent, where the accused honestly believed she was consenting, and questioned the reliability of her evidence. The court had discretion to distinguish in sentences for offences which were deliberately and those committed invol involuntarily due to self- induced intoxication. 4) The evidence raised by the defence was inconsistent with the accused’s evidence as to the state of his mind at the time of the offence. It was difficult to understand how someone who was so grossly intoxicated could be capable of having sexual intercourse such as that of a person who exercises their right to walk along highway at night in dark clothing."
b_2002skqb131.txt,"The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Informations were stayed. The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'. It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court. Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location. The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first. 3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3). There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken. The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances. 4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process. The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress. The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice. The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","The Crown appealed a summary conviction appeal by the Crown that was brought when the trial judge dismissed charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding.08 percent. The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the RCMP was an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs of the proceeding to the Crown in Alberta and $20,000 to the defence in Saskatchewan.  1)The trial judge erred in finding the court lost jurisdiction as he specifically found that if there was loss of jurisdiction it was over the offence. 2)The special plea by the respondent was based solely on the deemed dismissal for want of prosecution in Alberta. 3)The Court was unable to agree that an appearance by the Respondent in Saskatchewan as a result of a summons issued before May 7, 2001 revived jurisdiction over the respondent in Alberta or that the Alberta proceeding was an abusive exercise of process. 4)The Saskatchewan proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for wantof prosecution on May 6, 2001. 5)The application for a stay of the trial was dismissed. 6)The Crown sought to have the matter recommenced in Saskatchewan on the basis of a special plead of autRefois acquito. The Saskatchewan court had not lost jurisdiction over it and could have regained jurisdiction by following the procedure set out in s. 485.1 of the Code. The deemed dismissal did not preclude recommencing the proceedings in Saskatchewan in the future. 7)The court was unable, however, to agree the Saskatchewan proceeding revived jurisdiction in Alberta when it was deemed that the special plea had been applicable in this case. 8)The Alberta proceeding had been deemed to be dismissed for wants of prosecution on the merits. 9)The accused was not subject to further administrative sanctions or further sanctions in either province. 10)The defence was to defend both charges."

The journalists had no prior opportunity to hear its contents because Jones entered a guilty plea. The application was not opposed. The applicant sought an order for mandamus or a declaration. HELD: The presumption is in favour of public access to court records and the burden to contrary proof lies with the person who would deny access. This right is tempered by other factors (see R. v. SJS). Requiring the journalists to attend at the offices of the Attorney General and playing the CD ROM and making their own notes balances the interests of innocent parties whose conversations were recorded.","The Saskatoon Star-Post applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing. The accused entered a guilty plea to a charge of recording and distributing intercepted conversations. The Star-post was permitted to view the conversation on the CD-Rambler but its journalists had no prior opportunity to hear the contents of the CDROM because the accused entered guilty plea. The paper applied for the CD's access. The Attorney General did not oppose the application. It merely sought a court order to release the CD to the applicant. The applicant sought an order for mandamus, or a declaration. The Court of Queen's Bench is the appropriate court to obtain such relief. The presumption in favour of public access and the burden to the contrary proof lies upon the person who would deny the exercise of the right. This right is tempered somewhat by other factors. The Supreme Court of Canada has granted access to the CD in its own premises and own leisure. The Crown advised the applicant it must apply to the appropriate Court with notice to the Crown for an order to obtain access to it. Both counsel agree the exhibit is now under the control of the Attorney General and it is the proper respondent in this proceeding. The court is mindful of the original interests of the media in attending their own business and attending their usual business hours and attending those functions in their own homes and own time. The CD-Rom was filed by the Crown in its sentencing submissions and was not played for the sentencing judge. The journalists had access to view that evidence during their trial. The admission that the applicant had no access to listen to all the conversations on theCD-ROM was grounds for mandawala or declaration. Both sought to minimize harm to the public by noting that the Crown had not entered into an agreement to supply the CD with the audio and text summaries of the intercepted conversations that had been obtained by warrant. HELD: The application was granted. The exhibit was now under control of Saskatoon's daily newspaper and it was the appropriate respondent in the proceeding. 1)The Court of the Queen's Cross is the correct court to get such relief as McIntyre v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General) 1982 CanLII 14 (SCC), and Leader-Post v. Neuls are the appropriate precedents to achieve such relief in this manner. 2)The right is in favour. The burden to be borne by the person responsible for denying the exercise is squarely upon the one who would denied the exercise. The right is also tempered by other considerations. The"
b_2004skqb105.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applied for security for costs in the amount of $50,000. HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000. 1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant.","FIAT. The defendant applied to have the plaintiff's lien vacated. The applicant brought an application to have it ordered to provide security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The application was granted but the plaintiff was required to post security for cost. The plaintiff counterclaimed for $50k. The respondent indicated that he would consider it a step further by posting security for the costs of the counterclaim. HELD: The application for security for sufficiency of claims was dismissed and the order for costs was made in the lesser amount of money of $18,000 (the plaintiff was a non-resident). The court has discretion to order security for such costs where it is reasonably certain that the counter claim is not wholly distinct from the claim. The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily preclude an order for security but, in the circumstances of this case, it appears to be a factor which allows the court to do what is just and fair."

Even if the respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, the appellant failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach. The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit. This loss stemmed from the termination of its distributorship agreement with Mato, not from anything the respondent did.

HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame.

The appellant argued that the breathalyzer demand was valid and that pursuant to s24(2) of the charter, the certificate of analysis could not be tendered as evidence at trial. The Crown appealed both conclusions and sought a new trial. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittal set aside. The acquittal was allowed. The appeal is allowed and set aside with the acquittals and the trial results. The court erred in determining in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. The fact that the appellant was observed leaving the bar was relevant in determining whether it was reasonable for an officer to delay administering the test. In the totality, the trial court erased the evidence. The evidence was not properly assessed or relied upon in the circumstances.

b_2008skqb182.txt,"The tenant appeals the decision of the Hearing Officer granting her landlord a possession order of her rental premises. The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process. The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","The tenant appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer granting the landlord possession of her rental premises. This self-represented tenant included, as grounds of her appeal, 'procedural violations' and'misinformation as to the purpose of the hearing'. HELD: The tenants request an adjournment so that she can make arrangements to personally attend the hearing. 1) The three days notice given to the tenant was insufficient to allow her to make arrangements. 2) The hearing notice was properly served personally. The tenant did not appear. No notice or warning was needed. No one was advised of the possible problems with the boyfriend, who had been incarcerated at the time of the hearings. Since she was not personally present at the hearing, she could not even respond to such evidence or new allegations since she was unaware of them. The Hearing Officer, in accepting this 'boyfriend related evidence' when neither the Hearing Notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rules of natural justice and due process. The decision of whether or not an adjournments should be granted is inherently discretionary. The decisions must be taken with a view to what is necessary to ensure that justice is done between the parties. The discretion must be exercised judicially by the application of proper legal principles. 3) The tenant's request for an adjournion was not properly considered by the Hearing officer.

When he died, the former husband had not changed his will, which left the residue of his estate to his former wife. The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift. The mother of the deceased appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed, the appellant had failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounce a testamentary gift after his death. Even if the former spouse were so bound, there did not appear to be any privity of contract which would allow the appellant, who was not a party to the separation agreement, to enforce it.","The testator had left his wife, the residue of his estate, a few years later. They subsequently divorced. Upon his death, the executrix of his Estate applied for an interpretation of the will and separation agreement. The executrix applied for a separation agreement to determine whether the wife had signed a separation judgment which did not revoke the will or had revoked or changed the beneficiary designation in the Canada Life Policy. The deceased had not changed his will nor had he revoked or renewed the beneficial interest in property he had previously held. The wife appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge relied on Billing, Eccleston, Ecclesiastical and Mason v. Garbine, Brecht & Hall, and concluded that the separation agreement did not revolve around the right to renounce a will or a gift made by a former spouse; the phrase 'to renounce and waive any claim in the estate of the other' in the separation agreements was not used as an argument that the wife was bound by the will; nor was it stated in the will that renunciation would not occur until the death of the spouse; nor were there any warranties as to the validity of the gift; nor did the clause in the corollary relief judgment have any legal effect."

Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","The accused was found guilty of several drug offences after being arrested. The accused had been charged with possession and use of drugs in a home where his mother had advised him that she was fine. The police had entered the accused's home after receiving a distress call from the accused saying that she had been abused. The complainant advised the police that she and the accused were in a fight and her friend was picking her up. The officers entered the home after hearing the scream outside the home. The appellant advised the officers that there was a person lying on the bed and that she wanted her to come pick her up; she said that she could not get out of the house. The trial judge held that the police had a responsibility to enter the home and search, all without a warrant, and that their search of the premises was not a 'distress' call. The evidence heard on that Charter application was considered in the trial proper along with additional evidence obtained pursuant to the warrant. The Court found that the evidence found as result of the searches was excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The case law clearly required that police have the authority to investigate 911 calls but whether they should simply take the word of the person who answers the door that there is no problem inside. In those circumstances, police had to enter a residence, whether invited or not, and to search. The search was justified. The respondent was found to be in possession of drugs. The warrantless entry and search of his home was not authorized and the search was not justified. In the circumstances, the call was not made by the alleged victim or from his home. It was a recorded call. Although the call may have been involuntary and made pursuant to threats of violence, the admission of it in the evidence obtained under the warrant did not constitute a breach of s. 8 of the charter. The admission of the evidence by the respondent was not excluded."

The child was not performing well in her program with no explanation for her poor performance. HELD The burden is on the petitioner to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence. Although the child is a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act during the time she was attending classes, her expenses are excessive.

The Court of Appeal opted to deal with the merits of the application themselves, rather than remitting the matter back to Queen's Bench. While the allegation of fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, the pleading is nevertheless sufficient to answer the requirements of QB Rule 173.

It was not necessary for the applicant, who was employed in an administrative capacity by the First Nation, to turn to the Court of Queen's Bench for an order requiring her to provide further particulars of the alleged fraud.

The hearing officer determined that the landlord's claim for non-payment of rent had been established and that an order for possession as warranted. The hearing officer directed that the order of possession would be deferred if the tenant paid the rent that was owing and future rent. The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem. They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal. HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs. However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient. The Court held that it was impossible to tell whether the hearing officer considered the tenants' evidence at the hearing, made findings of fact in that regard or whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in this situation. The reasons are inadequate to allow a meaningful review of the decision.","The tenants appeal the decision of a hearing officer under s. 72 of The Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.

The decision of the hearing officers is set aside and the matter is remitted to the hearing office for rehearing.[1] The tenants sought to file affidavit evidence in support of their appeal. The tenants were permitted to remain in the premises until the end of May provided they paid the balance owing on the March rent and the full monthly rent. An order for possession was issued on the basis that the landlord honoured her commitment to pay the arrears and future rent. In default of payment an order of possession was to issue. Neither amount was paid. The tenant's application for possession of a rental unit was stayed execution of the order for a possession order pending appeal. Pursuant to s. 7 of the Act, the tenants had filed a separate claim under the same claim a few days prior to the date of the Hearing. Hears of the tenants at the hearing were heard over a period of time. The landlord appealed. Appeal allowed. At least half of the decision-closing argument (i.e. the existence of and efforts made to combat bed bugs) was based on factual argument and not on legal error.

b_2013skqb265.txt,"The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer. The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012. On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant. The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss.","The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies Hearing Officer in finding that the tenancy agreement was not a fixed-term agreement and that the landlord is legally disentitled to compensation pursuant to s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The tenant did not attempt to rent the premises following his receipt of the notice prior to re-renting it. He spent approximately $15,000 on furnishing the unit and himself spent approximately 15,000 dollars on the process. The tenant obtained a new tenant effective February 1, 2013 at $2500 per month. 2) The hearing officer erred in holding that a month-to-month tenancy would follow the primary fixed term negated a fixed term. The one-month notice provision referred to in the term of the lease was applicable only if the tenancy was extended to a month to month tenancy following the end of the fixed term (i.e. if the tenant had not complained to the landlord about the noise). The one month notice provision was applicable in the lease only if it was extended beyond the end term (vi). The rental was $2100. 3) The appellant failed to prove entitlement to rent. The hearing officers erred by holding that the fact a monthto- month tenancy would followed the primary primary fixed- term negates a fixed Term. The 1 month notice provisions referred to by the termof the lease were applicable only in the sense of the term and were not retroactive to the year of the termination.

b_2013skqb395.txt,HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of 10 counts and 7 counts were dismissed.,"The accused was charged with 14 counts of indecent assault and three counts of gross indecency against 14 individuals, all of whom were boys who attended the residential school between January 1, 1959 and December 31, 1967. The residential school was located at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys there. The boys also developed the intermural hockey, competitive fastball and softball teams and the Beauval Warriors, which was the regional champion hockey team through most of the years. There were times when the relationship with various boys crossed the line from appropriate and acceptable behaviour to gross indecencies. The Court was required to take into account the potential distraction of the trier of fact from its proper focus on the facts charged and the potential for undue time consumption. HELD: The Court reserved its decision respecting the application and undertook to render a decision at the time of its final judgment. 1) The Court accepted that there is less likelihood of moral prejudice, reasoning prejudice and propensity reasoning in a judge alone trial as opposed to jury trial as well as a general prejudice. However, there is a risk that the'similar facts' are denied by the accused, resulting in conflict between seeking to admit what appears to be cogent evidence bearing on a material issue and the need to avoid unfairness to the right of the accused to respond. The evidence has a limited opportunity to respond to such evidence. Logistical problems may be compounded by the lapse of time, surprise and the collateral issue rule. 2) The accused truly did care for the boys and were the most important people in his entire life. However the relationship was often tense and there were times that the accused would often be late for work or late for school. The psychological impact of exposure to such exposure can be severe. The impact on the accused personally and professionally is severe. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for sexual assault and the same sentence in each of the 14 counts. 3) The cumulative effect of 50 years of similar facts will have a detrimental effect on the ability of the Crown to bring similar facts to the attention of the general public. The trial judge was required not to allow similar facts evidence to apply to all 17 charges. The issue is actus reus. The length of time between the hearings will likely outweigh the advantages of a jury trial. The preliminary hearing will likely be shorter and the evidence will have to be re-examined. 4) The evidence of the four complainants who"

The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor. The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years. As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800. Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836. The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500.","The tenant sued the landlord for damages for failing to clean, wax and polish the vinyl tile floor in the building, thereby permitting moisture to penetrate between and underneath the tiles resulting in lifting and cracking. The tenant also claimed economic interference. HELD: The tenant was awarded judgment against the landlord in the amount of $6,464 ($3,964 plus $2,500) for failing, waxing and polishing the floor. The court accepted that a part, but only a part was due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor; the water leakage into the building from the ceiling, the basement and the interior walls all contributed to the problem. The evidence does show that a small part, perhaps 25% was due the negligence, as the tenant was contributorily negligent to the extent of 25% of the damage. Leaking of water through the ceiling did necessitate closure of the restaurant, causing reduction of customers who could reasonably be expected to be put off by the unsightly ceiling and floor tiles, and the catchment of the dripping water. The landlord is to apply for a base monthly rent of $7,700 as specified in clause 8(b) of the lease. The tenants may set off this judgment against their base monthly rental of $1,700."

The court applied the rules of statutory interpretation, specifically the presumption of coherence and overlap, to the provisions of the Act and found that the applicant was using s. 186.1 for a purpose that the legislature did not intend. The applicant could have proceeded to dissolution under Division XVI. In s. 210(m) the legislature intended to give the court the ability to order disposition of property of creditors and shareholders but not to deal with a shareholder’s right to distribution on dissolution.","Shareholders approved a plan of arrangement and sought an order approving it pursuant to s. 186.1 of the Business Corporations Act. The plan of arrangements involves a proposed liquidation and dissolution with a provision that if various shareholders of record cannot be found after outreach efforts, their pro rata entitlement to return of the corporation's capital will accrue to and be paid to the remaining known shareholders. The proposal proposed to distribute the remaining property to shareholders of the company, in the form of money or in property, in a manner consistent with the terms of the Act and in which the distribution of the capital would be based. The purpose of the arrangement was to assist in relieving the Shareholders against the losses suffered by them and to provide those shareholders with a reasonable opportunity to identify themselves and to obtain return of their respective original investments. HELD: The Court found that s.186.1 was being used by the FCC for a purpose which the legislature did not intend. The context within which this was provided must be considered. The application was dismissed. The court found no conflict between the power given by the court in s.210(l) to override the mandatory directions in s220(1) and s220 (1) of the SBCA and that the Court could exercise its power under s. 210(l)(i) while comply with the mandatory direction in s210(1). The application for an order for the court to override s220 and s210 (1)(o) did not engage the arguments and issues that were in play in the present situation.

The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change.

The Ministry’s position was that both parties were able and willing to provide the minimum level of parenting required for the child’lls needs. The Court also found that neither parent had demonstrated the kind of permanency that would justify any form of reunification now or in the foreseeable future. The issue was whether the children were receiving the level of parental care that was below the minimal standard that will be tolerated in our society. The respondent’d parents were in the position to allow the child to be placed with them.
b_2018skpc52.txt,"/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry. The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","The accused was charged with angling for or consuming fish in waters closed to commercial and recreational fishing contrary to s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995. The issue was whether the accused was bound by s.7(2) of s.8 of the Regulations, made pursuant to the Saskatchewan Fisheries Act, 1995 and whether his Treaty right to fish for sustenance/food was violated. HELD: The accused was granted a stay of the charge. The Court found that the evidence presented was that the accused admitted to the actus reus of the substantial charge but put forth as defence his Treaty rights to fish in any water and at any time he so chooses. The evidence also showed that the restriction on commercial fishing in the area was not an infringement on his Treaty Right to fish. The only infringement that the Saskatchewan government could be found to be reasonably justified was the reduction of the quota for commercial and outfitter recreational anglers to 5 percent. The accused’s evidence remained uncontradicted by any defence evidence."

The court believed the evidence provided by the two accused and found that it was possible that the lease represented the actual arrangement between them and O.G. and that they believed that there only 400 plants in the greenhouses and they were part of a legal grow operation. The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him. Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G. The accused had explained that the cash seized by the police from their house had been received by them after they sold a trailer.","Criminal Law – Cannabis Business – Home InvasionHELD: The Court of Appeal held that an amendment to an information expanding the time particulars of the offence can be made at trial based upon evidence that indicates the offence may have been committed within the amended timeframe. Since the evidence was to the effect that marijuana plants did not start arriving until early June, grant amendment of the indictment to cover the period March 1, 2016 to September 15, 2016. The Court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused were unlawfully producing cannabis and possessed the cannabis for the purposes of trafficking. The evidence established that the marijuana plants being grown on their property was being grown by another individual or individuals to whom they had leased the property for that purpose. HELD: 1) The evidence was that some 700 plants of marijuana were being grown at the accused's property. The accused were in fact in control of the premises and actively participated in the husbandry of the plants and thus they were both producing and in possession of marijuana. The property was in reference to two greenhouses totalling approximately 8000 sq. ft. 2) The Court held that the evidence of the accused was not a reliable indicator of when construction of the greenhouses would start. 3) The accused's residence was found to be in the vicinity of a large open field. The residence was in the shade of a small, open field and was in good condition. 4) The amount of money found in their possession was $12,000. 5) The court found that it was not in the amount of the cash found in the residence but in the quantity of the marijuana."

A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 236(a) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46 and his guilty plea to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so. The accused had been previously convicted of second degree murder, but his conviction was changed to manslaughter, which was punishable by a term of four years imprisonment or more. The Crown requested a detailed Gladue Report be prepared by the Crown and provided with the court's assistance. The report was extensively researched and produced in detail. The court was satisfied that the Crown had ample evidence that the accused had a long record of criminal offences, and that there were numerous Gladue factors that the Court should have further information on. The sentencing judge also suggested that a concurrent sentence of 1 year, 5 months to be served in a federal penitentiary would be appropriate. The Court reviewed the cases prepared by counsel for the Crown, the defence and the accused and found that a global sentence of 10 years was appropriate in this case to be serve in a provincial penitentiaries. The sentences prescribed were: 1) a concurrent life sentence of 9 years; 2) a 10 year global sentence with no parole eligibility until Gordon has served half of that sentence pursuant to ss. 743.6(1) of The Criminal Code; 3) the sentencing judge suggested that Correctional Service Canada should do their work without being impeded by the Court's arbitrary imposition of such an order that would result in the accused not being eligible for parole until he had served half his sentence. The principles of sentencing were summarized in s. 718.2 of the Code which states that the sentences must be similar to sentences imposed for similar offences committed in similar circumstances. The broad principles of sentence and the principles of justice were examined. The trial judge concluded that a sentence of one year concurrent (1 year) to an eight year sentence for manslaughter was appropriate, primarily as a result of the Court having to recognize the multiple Gladue factor's that have to be addressed. A global sentence for the offence of manslaughter was determined to be appropriate in the case of this case."

The plaintiffs suffered significant loss of income, significant debt, and even further debt of approximately $20,000 due to the delay in obtaining financing. The defendant's conduct amounting to a breach of the agreement was 'wanton or reckless'. The defendants' failure to obtain their financing, which was conditional upon them obtaining financing within twelve banking days, and the fact that the plaintiff had left the province without advising her husband about the possibility of legal action against them had all but ensured that the plaintiffs would not be able to defend their claim for damages for the mental distress in the future."

The parties cohabitated for approximately twelve years. The plaintiff was employed as a medical records techinician, but for most of the years she worked part-time and then became a stay at home mom. The defendant claimed general and special damages and costs. The wife also claimed general damages and special costs. Applying the principles of fairness and justice in a constructive manner, the wife met the three requirements to prove an unjust enrichment including that she had received sufficient income to pay the necessary debts and that the defendant was chargeable as a constructive trustee. The evidence showed that the wife's contributions to the family were minimal, as her income was tied simply to the use of her time and energy. The court found that the evidence showed a causal connection between the husband's business and the wife, that her involvement in his business directly assisted in the preservation of the property and its continuation in his absence, and that there was no juristic reason for the enrichment. The husband's substantial contributions to his business and his considerable income were sufficient to satisfy the three criteria. The fact that the parties lived together for twelve years and had four children did not diminish the wife’s contribution to the husband’ business."
c_1995canlii5774.txt,"The parties applied to the Court to resolve the issues of spousal support and a division of the matrimonial property. The parties had been married 4 years. There were no children of the marriage. The Wife had a university education but was unemployed. She had already received interim support in the amount of $1,500.00 per month for 1 year. HELD: 1)The support order was terminated effective November 30, 1995. 2)The Court determined the value of a resort property owned by the Husband in BC and permitted an exemption for its value as at the date of marriage. 3)The Court refused to permit the Wife to subtract from the value of her assets, the amount owing on a student loan which pre-dated the marriage. 4)With the exception of those items already discussed, the Court divided the value of the matrimonial property equally.","Three issues were resolved as follows: the date spousal support should terminate, the value of the property in British Columbia and whether the wife's student loan was a matrimonial debt. HELD: The husband's obligation to support the wife should end. He was entitled to an exemption for this amount pursuant to s. 23 of The Matrimonial Property Act. 1)The loan was used to pay debts incurred by the wife prior to the marriage. Those debts are not associated with the marriage and the Court found that it was reasonable for the husband to support his wife such a long time. 2)The wife's health was fragile and it was illogical and unfair that he should be required to share payment of one year of support. 3)The court found the value to be $49,000.00 on the date the action was commenced. Therefore, $38,600 was the value divided between the parties."

The evidence at trial indicated that the alleged acts had occurred prior to the accused becoming an adult. He had not been ordered transferred into adult court under s.16 of The Young Offenders Act. HELD: Accused acquitted. 1)The Judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had sexually assaulted the complainant. 2)Because the complainant's evidence suggested that the assault occurred while the accused was a young offender the Judge concluded that the Court of Queen's Bench was without jurisdiction in the matter.,"The sole issue was whether it was proven beyond reasonable doubt that the sexual assaults alleged occurred on or after October 22, 1986, the date that the accused became an adult. The case had not come to the Youth Court by way of transfer from the Youth Courts. A concurrent proceeding was pending in Youth Court. HELD: 1)Jury selection was ordered and the accused was acquitted of the charge. 2)The complainant was not as credible as the accused as she was and although the one or two incidents of improper touching took place after the sexual intercourse incident, she quite frankly admitted that he had attempted to have sexual intercourse with her when she was 9 and he subsequently moved from the Indian Reserve to Prince Albert while he was still young and had no further contact with the complainant. 3)The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt (as it had been concluded) that the offences occurred between the dates of 1986 and 1988 when the accused ceased to be a young person. 4)The evidence was not properly assembled as it could have been. 5)The accused was found not guilty of the charges."

In making his ruling, the Chambers judge found that the respondents were creditors of the bankrupt estate for the purposes of s. 38(1). The respondents subsequently commenced an action against the appellant. The appellant applied to the judge assigned to oversee the case management of the action for an order striking the Statement of Claim on the basis that the respondents were not creditors of the bankrupt estate and, therefore, should not have been granted the order authorizing the commencement of the action. The case management judge held that he did not have the jurisdiction to inquire into the merit of the s. 38 order. He dismissed the action. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that the case management judge did not err. The appellant could not collaterally attack the s. 38 order by challenging a factual finding made in the granting of the order.","The appellant sought to strike the respondent's Originating Notice and Statement of Claim. He argued that the chambers judge had not jurisdiction to grant the s. 38 Order but, when he knew that the correctness of the Order would be tested on the application, should have removed himself as he would not be able to deal with the application in an impartial and unbiased manner without personal prejudice to himself.

c_1998canlii12367.txt,"The decision of the Board of Arbitration was held by the chambers judge to be fundamentally flawed in that the majority brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had discarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions. She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable. Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. 2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'. Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky. The Chambers judge did not follow that approach. Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears. The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation. Such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges.","The Chambers judge found that the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration in the grievance was patently unreasonable. She found that because the words in the collective agreement could not reasonably bear the phrase 'pursuant to' which the majority had chosen, the phrase was'more reasonable' than the interpretation which the respondent had favoured. The resulting interpretation was not necessarily unreasonable."

Both acknowledged that they were aware of the nature and effect of the agreement and each had independent legal advice before signing. The husband paid periodic spousal support until December 1995. The applicant sought to vary the 1993 order on the grounds there had been a change in circumstances in that her annual income was currently less than half of what it had been at the time the order was made and her economic hardship could be traced to the breakdown of her marriage primarily because his job had required them to move from place to place during the marriage.

c_2000skqb232.txt,"FIAT. The husband seeks to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' 1975 separation agreement. This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first. The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years. The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income. In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement. At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent. The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established. Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement. It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income. This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support. The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement. The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent. The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support.","FIAT.

The agreement provided for annual adjustments to the spouse amount payable based upon the increase in the Consumer Price Index. The wife was 67 years old and retired and still had a much lower standard of living than the husband even after taking into account the amount she was receiving as spousals. The fact it had occurred is not that kind of radical unforseen change in circumstance required to be established upon the authorities to support the variation application.

Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced. The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver.

There was insufficient detail on the factors listed in s.98(3)(b). There was no evidence of pattern of persistent violent behaviour and the young person had only 90 days remaining for the community supervision portion of his sentence. There were no new offences committed. The issue was whether the young Person was likely to re-offend. The Court found that this likely event.

The plaintiff appealed the judgment of the Queen's Bench and Appeal and ultimately she sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, all appeals and applications being dismissed. She elected trial by judge and jury and to be self-represented. The trial began April 21, 2003. The first threshold issue to be considered by the jury is whether or not any of the defendants breached their professional duty of care. This is a matter beyond the jurisdiction of the jury to decide based upon ordinary common sense and experience. There is no expert evidence presented by the plaintiff to the jury that will provide the jury with the competence to reach a conclusion on this second most fundamental issue. The standard of care in professional negligence is not one which the jury could decide without the aid of expert evidence. The latter two issues are the main issues which the Jury would have to decide in this case. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the plaintiff had presented no evidence that would have been useful to assist the jury in respect of the prospective deliberations and ultimate verdict in this matter. The Court also awarded the defendant one set of costs only against her, the same to be taxed pursuant to column unless any other provisions of the rules were applicable. The defendant was entitled to costs only. 1)The court reviewed the cases of Hagblom v. Henderson and Campbell and found that matters falling within the ordinary common law sense are beyond the jury's competence to decide. The test to be applied by the court in adjudicating upon an application for non-suit in negligence involves consideration by the defendant of professional judgment and professional principles. The principles of admissibility and the appropriate strategy to address those legal issues are all complex and important professional judgments to be made by the trial lawyer. 2)The plaintiff was given every opportunity, if not encouragement, to call required experts. She chose not to. 3)The trial judge by weighing the evidence and deciding the substantive issue of causation applied the higher test of the balance of probabilities rather than the lower standard for non sufficiency. The jury therefore had no evidence upon which they could possibly render a competent verdict upon the disparate facts relied upon by the plaintiffs in the evidence that she presented."

The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made. Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside. The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints.

The appellant argues that the learned trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal is entered.  1) The court reviewed in detail the steps the appellant had in place. 2) The court was of the view that the trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for this defence. The trial judge applied a standard of due diligence that required the appellant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or action that could have been taken to prevent the company's cashiers from selling cigarettes. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law. Had the appropriate standard of due diligence been applied to the facts of this case, the appellant would have succeeded.","The defendant was convicted of carrying out an unlawfully in conveying a tobacco product contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act. The defendant was a corporation that was charged in an information that stated that it was prohibited from selling tobacco to minors. The information was obtained through undercover inspections. The undercover inspections were conducted to ensure compliance. The evidence showed that the cashiers were regularly asked for and given recognition tests. The tests were conducted in relation to the store's policy on selling tobacco. The trial judge found the appellant guilty of selling tobacco products to minors and found that the appellant had complied with its obligations under the Act. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was quashed, the sentence was vacated and an acquittal entered. 1)The trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for defence of due diligence for a strict liability offence. The system implemented by Westfair Foods Ltd. in R. v. Westfair to prevent the sale of tobacco to a minors was essentially the same as the procedure followed by WestFair in this case. 2)The evidence tendered at the trial suggests that prior to the incident on August 25, 2003, prior to Westfair had an established system created to prevent their cashiers from selling cigarettes to minors, prior the company's cashiers had been required to provide identification to the cashier. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. 3)The court found that it is only reasonable to ask a question of a regular employee once a year to establish a defence of diligence for strict liability offences. The question before the trial judge was whether the appellant took all reasonable care in establishing proper system to prevent them from selling Tobacco to minors (ie. they had a proper system for preventing their cashier from selling the tobacco to underage customers). The trial Judge erred by applying an unreasonable high standard of due due diligence. The defence will be available if the accused reasonably believed in a mistaken set of facts, if he took all necessary steps to prevent its commission, and if he exercised all reasonable steps to ensure its effective operation of the system. 4)The Court found that to establish the defence of a defence such as was decided in RFL v. Wfair Foods, the accused must show on a balance of probabilities that the conduct took place without its direction or approval, that it exercised all lawful care by establishing a proper legal system to preventing the sale, and that it took reasonable steps (e.g. ensuring the effective operation"

In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit from the respondent, developer.

The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed orally. There was nothing in the Chambers judge order or her reasons that indicated that she in any way touched upon the substantive issue, namely the issue whether the purchase agreement was frustrated by supervening events. The issue of frustration was not before the Court in any event. The Chambers judge's finding that the remedy of specific performance was not available did not constitute an adverse finding against the appellant on the issue of frustrated. The miscellaneous interests identified by the Chambers court stand for 'interest in land', 'use of property', and 'design'. The appellant was not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'."
c_2009skpc31.txt,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1. The defendant was the President and sole Director of Chisums. The company assembles log home packages in the Weyakwin district north of Prince Albert. These packages are sold to customers across Canada and around the world. The defendants purchased logs from Wood Products (1985) Ltd. (Lamp Products), through its contractor, Logging (P E), harvest wood from the forest in and around Glaslyn. They sell this wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as ChisUM. The defence argued that the process used by Chisuma was more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. The nature of the business as noted in the Corporate Registry shows that the wood is harvested from Provincial Crown lands. It is further supported by the evidence presented that the logs delivered to Chisam included the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. HELD: The defendant's application to restrict the requirement for processing facility licensing was dismissed. The court found that the defendant was not violating the Act. The issue was whether the Crown had shown that the Forest Resources management Act requires a licence. The requirement for a processing Facility Licence was not reasonable to restrict Chisom to the point that only one processing facility is required to be licenced for the manufacture of forest product. The process detailed in P-1 encompassed the substantial amount of logging that was to be made in the logging industry. The logging process was not an insignificant process, nor is it process removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest land."
c_2009skqb433.txt,"The Ministry seeks an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys Michael and David being placed for adoption. Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care. The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody. HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.  1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys. However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context. There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister. It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted. The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","The parents of two boys, ages 8 and 11, who were apprehended from their maternal grandparents, A.H. and Laura, sought an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoption. The boys' mother opposed the application and petitioned the Court to return the boys to their parents. HELD: 1) The Court found that the parents had a laissez-faire approach to sexuality and that, in failing to detect that, when faced with the prospect of adoption, the parents should have made an effort to retain the boys. They were, therefore, required to be placed with the Minister. The Court ordered the boys placed with their father. The father was to pay a $1,000 finder's fee and was to have the children apprehended. The mother was to retain all of the children's records. 2) The children's parents were to pay the same amount as the father and were to have regular contact with them. The court found that, although the parents' relationship was strained, the children had a positive one. The parents' parenting was exemplary. The children had an exemplary upbringing. The courts of Manitoba have a duty to protect children such that their protection may only be attained through adoption. 3) The court was satisfied that the children were placed with a loving, caring, and caring father. It was also satisfied that, based on the evidence presented by the children, the father had a similar approach to parenting. The best interests standard mandated by s.37(4)(a) is necessarily an individualistic approach. The 'best interests standard' mandated by the Act is necessarily individualistic. An individualistic, individualistic and individualistic ApproachThe Court found the following with respect to the children: 1), that the father's approach to child care was exemplary; 2) There was a continuum of care and attention from the mother to the child and child, and the mother's approach was just as applicable to the foster parents. The child's needs were met in a somewhat unorthodox household where the parents were often in the habit of allowing the boys and their children to roam the house naked and to listen to music while they were with their children; 3) There were no problems with the children engaging in activities with their parents; and 4) The parents were required to supervise the care of the boys in their home. The home was often used as a social gathering spot. The physical plant of the home was a challenge as the children"
c_2009skqb514.txt,"FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008. She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177. 3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.  4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment. As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5) The mother shall have her costs of $600.","The mother has filed a motion requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the 2008 order. As the Gunn J order is premised on the child, Adam, residing with the mother and the child David, residing in the father's home, have moved to the mother's home. In light of the fact that the father has given up his new employment position, it would be unfair to have the father continue to provide support on the basis of an income in the sum of $270,300 when the evidence is clear he will earn less than that amount. HELD: With respect to the capital gain shown on the father’s 2008 income tax return, the Court determined that the capital loss is a non-reoccurring amount which should not be included in the determination of the fathers 2008 Income. It is clear from the evidence that the son has only one source of income, being his new job. The fact that he spent his severance funds on legal fees and to set up his own new home in Alberta is irrelevant. The severance is included as part of the dad’S income. 1) With respect only to the father, who agreed to assume responsibility for the capital gains on the real estate he was receiving as partof the family property division, it was unfair to continue to support on an income of $250,300 that he will not earn in 2009. 2) With regard to the son’ s. expenses, the father was ordered to pay $25,000 per month based on his 2008 income. 3) The father was also ordered to recalculate the amount for the preceding 12 months based on the actual Federal Child Support Guidelines. The father shall pay the difference of $918 forthwith. 4) The mother was ordered ordered to calculate s. support payable for the two children. The amount of support due and owed was based solely on his 2007 tax year and not an averaging of his previous three years. 5) The Court ordered that the amount of s. arrearage be determined on the balance of his income.  6) The amount owing to the respondent mother was to recalculated. If the parties proceeded in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the Father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income which included an intense pre-trial conference."

The accused was grossly lacking in mental abilities, had limited and basic comprehension, had the mental capacity of a young child and these facts were not likely to change anytime soon. The accused had extreme difficulty paying attention to the court proceedings and appeared incapable of doing so. He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD: The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability. The accused said that his lawyer was the judge, could not answer when asked what the judge's role was and he had limited insight into why he was in Court. The accused met the portion of the limited cognitive capacity test which requires an understanding of the nature of the proceedings and their possible consequences and the accused is capable of communicating his version of the events surrounding the allegations, but there is no possibility he could participate in a meaningful way in the trial. According to R. v. Jobb, the limited cognitive capacity test does not require that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to himself, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether an accused can recount to their counsel the necessary facts of the offence to present a defence. The accused in this case was found fit to stand trial because he had a memory of what happened during the alleged offence despite having virtually no ability to participate in the proceeding.",The accused was found unfit to stand trial for various offences.

c_2011skqb100.txt,A judgment issued from the Court along with a writ of execution. The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750. 1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted. There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order from the Court of Appeal requiring the legal office of the president of the corporation to produce to the sheriff of the Judicial Centre of Prince Albert, the shares owned by the president in Jen-Sim Cattle Co. Ltd. pursuant to the June 5, 2001 writ of execution. HELD: 1) The solicitor's lien arises out of s. 66(3) of The Legal Profession Act. The solicitor has no rights greater than those of the client. He owns the shares himself. They cannot be subsumed to the company and thus become liable to a solicitor's Lien as being part of the records of the company. The claim for lien is not made out. 2) The court found that the president's liens were not valid and ordered the law firm to produce and deliver the shares to the Sheriff. The sheriff was unable to enforce the writ because of the actions of the three solicitors. The court ordered the firm to supply and deliver to the court the shares of the plaintiff. 3) The sheriff ordered the lawyer to produce the shares. The lawyer's lian is not valid. 4) Given the totality of the evidence before the court, the court did not consider a valid solicitor's liien to have been made out as the plaintiff had no other recourse. The defendant had no better right to retain documents than his client would have if still in possession of them. The argument that the receiver cannot have rights greater that those of a solicitor cannot be sustained. 5) The defendant was given several opportunities to produce shares and notice that the non-production of the shares would result in a court application by the sheriff for their production. The judge was unable, however, to determine the amount owing by the plaintiff to the defendant."
c_2011skqb478.txt,"The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code. At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: possession of a controlled substance for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act; unlawfully possessing property (or proceeds of property), knowing that all (or part) of that property was obtained as a result of the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to section 354 and 355(a)of the Criminal Code; possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking; breach of probation; breach probation; failure to comply with terms and conditions of the probation and drug trafficking provisions; breach to probation; aggravating circumstances; the accused's pre-trial detention which included the fact that he was found in possession of cocaine and marijuana at the time he was arrested; the amount of cocaine found in his possession was admittedly for the use of trafficking and he was previously convicted of a designated substance offence. The accused had nine prior drug convictions, two for trafficking and one conspiracy to traffic which resulted him receiving a sentence of 5 years in the penitentiary; aggravations included the 34 year old accused's previous drug related record; his previous drug addictions; his failure to take advantage of opportunities to obtain employment and the opportunity to make a living as a software developer; and his failure, in this case, to take steps to enhance his skills and training in the field, to minimize the potential for conflict and to promote the careers of young people in the drug trade. The aggravating circumstance was that the amount in the accused’s possession was a substantial amount of drugs in question for the intended trafficking purpose. The amount of money found in the trailer when it was found was part of the proceeds of crime found to be in his custody when he was apprehended and of which he was being found guilty; the defendant’ s. 719(3) and 3.1 Criminal Code provisions did not apply to this case because the accused was a 34 year-old accused with no children nor was he employed at the relevant time. The court found that the offences were for the commission of trafficking for the offence of trafficking, and that the defendant would have qualified, had he been in the regular prison population, for a one-third reduction in his sentence for good behaviour. The defendant”s pre-sentence detention was aggravating in that it related to his lengthy time on remand awaiting trial and his lengthy pre- trial detention which resulted in him"
c_2012skpc90.txt,"The plaintiffs hired the defendant to perform renovations to their home. The plaintiffs terminated the contract believing the defendant's workmanship was poor and that he caused some damage to their home and created a mess. The plaintiffs sued the defendant alleging damages. The defendant counterclaimed the cost of the work completed but for which he was not paid and compensation for the lost use of his tools. HELD: The Court granted judgment for damages in the amount of $3,822 for necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning expenses and granted the counter-claim in the amount of $580 for unpaid work performed by the defendant and then applied setoff. The Court allowed the cost of issuing the claim and for reasonable cost of service.","The plaintiffs claim damages for $5,975.95 for the removal of a bedroom wall. The original estimate was agreed to by the plaintiffs. The plaintiff alleged that the general contractor, who was not allowed to finish the job, was not able to finish it. The damage was caused by the defendant's trouble light. The plaintiffs claim for lost use of tools. The general contractor denies he performed any workmanlike manner, saying he was not permitted to finish. The table of contents showed that the defendant applied extra drywall mud to the crease between the new and existing walls in an attempt to make them appear flush with the existing walls. The defendant applied another layer of mud to his work surface, splashing mud on the oak woodwork, ceiling, walls and carpet, causing a 'hangover' effect. The tables of contents show that the plaintiffs' claim for the cost of the repair work done by the plaintiff was reduced by 10% or $294. The counterclaim for lost wages is allowed against the claim of the plaintiffs in the amount of $3,342.00. HELD: 1)The counterclaim of the defendant is set off against the plaintiffs claim of $5.95. The $3.342.1 is awarded against the general contractors for the $4,286.95 claim for damages for the loss of wages. 2)The plaintiffs were awarded judgment for $3 million. The claim for punitive damages is dismissed. The court found that the plaintiff's conduct constituted a breach of the contract and negligence, there was nothing malicious, oppressive or high-handed, such that punitive damages are rationally required to punish or deter. The objective of punitive damages was to punish rather than compensate. They are confined to exceptional cases where the defendant’s conduct was so malicious, abusive and high- handed that it offends the court’S sense of decency."
c_2012skqb372.txt,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application for relief in the alternative under Queen's Bench Rules 108(d) and amendments to that rule. HELD: The Court of Appeal does not strike the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution. The delay from June 2010 to May 2012 really is a delay from May 2011 until May 2012 and solely on the head of counsel for the plaintiff for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. The period between May 2000 to May 2010 was a time when matters had progressed on a tighter time line. The Court found that the delay was inordinate and inexcusable. As the defendant is retired from active business, this delay is not causing him any professional embarrassment or damage to reputation. It is not at such an early stage that it would lead the Court on its own to strike. The time delay is only an inexcusible one. The amount of delay is solely attributable to the defendant's counsel for not timely responding to the undertaking. The plaintiff received information in 2006 about an application to produce settlement amounts from his farm. In May 2011, the defendant issued a statement of claim against Neigum, his tenant, and Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company. This was approximately two weeks after the application for this motion had been filed. The defendant applied to strike the claim for wants of prosecution as the delay from April 2010 to June 2012 was inordinately long. The applicant argued that as the settlement documents were negotiated and meant to remain private, blanket privilege attaches to them and they are not disclosable. The plaintiffs argued that they were understood that the action against Mr. Hoeppner would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawana. HOLD: The defendant has made its case and ordered the specific amounts for each structure for which it settled its claim to be disclosed. The stage of litigation is at a point where it could well go to pre-trial conference. Therefore it is not too early to strike on that basis."
c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The issue is whether the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to s810 hearing. The judge ruled that the usual Rules of evidence apply to this s.810 Hearing. The court also held that records kept by the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. Hearsay evidence is admissible. The Crown applied to have the criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and the NPB's reasons for ordering detention admitted into evidence. The defendant opposed the admission of these documents. The Court reviewed the business rules of law and found that the normal rules of trial apply to these hearings. The accused submits these are errors in law in that the ordinary criminal rules of information apply to the s.810 hearings. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)S.8 10 hearings are not criminal trials. The usual rules as prescribed by s. 723 of the Code apply. 2)Hearsay is not admissible in evidence at the provincial court. The normal rules as set out in R. v. Fontaine, 2010 SKPC 16 (CanLII), 359 Sask.R. 277 (O.C.A.). 3)The Court found that s.880.2 does not create an offence but rather it seeks to prevent the commission of a criminal offence. It is preventative rather than punitive. 4)The burden of proof is on the applicant under s8 10.2. The test is both subjective and objective. It must be established (1) that the victim actually fears that the defendant will cause personal injury to him; and (2) reasonable grounds exist for the informant's fear. The first condition is subjective, while the second is objective; namely, the Crown must establish subjectively the informant is belief and whether his belief is objectively founded. 5)The standard of review is correctness on a question of law.

The plaintiff had not proven his claim on a balance of probabilities that the defendant was responsible for the damage to his lawn.,"The plaintiff alleges that the defendant applied a substance in the back alley next to his property which caused damage to his lawn in the Town of Wadena. A Back-Track Investigations and Special Services report supports the plaintiff's belief that damage occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of a substance from the back alley. However, the evidence does not support that. In preceding years, before it was moved to the Statchuk yard, it was used to store tools, machinery and applicators. The floor in it replaced before moving to his yard. The defendant's shed was used as a storage area for tools, equipment and applicator. The evidence does support the plaintiff’s belief that the damage occurred due to the shed and not the lawn. However the evidence did not support the defendant’S claim on a balance of probabilities. The plaintiff was not satisfied on a case of probabilities that the offending substance came from the alley or that it came from its property. HELD: The plaintiff”s claim was dismissed. The onus is not on the defendant to establish an alternative source of the offending substances and this involves proving that the plaintiff was responsible for killing their lawn. The court found that the onus was not on him to establish his claim on balance of probability. The applicant was not required to prove his claim because the evidence conflicted with the facts. While the plaintiff had access to farm chemicals through his employment with Crop Production Services, he had no knowledge of their use and the soil sterilant was probably not the cause. There were no similar issues anywhere else in town where gravel from the same source was used. Defence led evidence of the fact that house was demolished in the area and debris may have been removed through the back lane, suggesting that perhaps this was the cause for the change in weather. The only conclusion that the evidence could have been drawn was that the respondent had been moved into his yard which would have allowed him to move the substance into the alley and into the property. The Court dismissed the plaintiff because it was not concluded that he had anything to do with putting the substance in that alley or from the St.atchuk property."

The appellant sought to recover its losses from the respondent and relied on an exclusionary clause. Allowing the appeal in part, that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct; and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent. In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products. Prior to 1985 that activity, exclusively wholesale, was achieved through a nation wide network of outlets leased from the appellant and operated by agents on a commission basis. Those agents were not required to make personal investment in the franchise, provide staff of two, rather than three, and were financially responsible for the inventory. The appellant knew from the outset that Murphy was not going to operate the franchise full-time, but would rely on former Atlas employees. The trial judge found that the appellant had not conducted an independent investigation of the franchise and found that it was not viable on its own merits.

Allowing the appeal, setting aside the sentence and imposing a sentence of two years in a federal institution, followed by one year probation, with an order prohibiting possession of firearms following release. Although there were some mitigating factors, they were not such as to call for a suspended sentence considering the serious nature of the offence and its prevalence.","The respondent pled guilty to a charge that he stole a sum of money from the complainant when armed with an offensive weapon, a tire iron.

He had a grade 11 education, was unemployed and had an admitted drug problem. He informed the trial Judge that he wanted help for his addiction problem.

He would be prohibited from having in his possession any type of weapon for a period of time commencing on the day the order is made and expiring five years after the time of his release from imprisonment.

Her employment was terminated. The amount of interim custody and access was reviewed in July 1997. Given the petitioner's modest income and the respondent's brother's indemnities 700 the court believed that an attribution of income of $800 per month was fair for the current determination of maintenance.

d_1999canlii1536.txt,"A wife claimed part of the estate of her estranged husband. The Court considered the applicability of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act, the Matrimonial Property Act, and the Pension Benefits Act. Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate, that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed. To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator. This involves a very broad judicial discretion. Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance.","The plaintiff and his wife, who claimed to be the deceased's only surviving child, had been living in India for 14 years. They had been married for 14.5 years. Their son, who was the same age as the plaintiff, was born in India. They lived in Nova Scotia and were together for 15 years. The plaintiff eventually obtained a second estate in the United States. The defendant brought a third estate in Nova Scotia. The deceased's Will was executed in 1997. The parties had each made a separate claim for relief under the Testators' Family Maintenance Act and the Matrimonial Property Act. The cause of death was mixed drug overdose. The evidence led in both respects to the continuing claims for relief sought by the plaintiff. The present-day testamentary capacity of the deceased was in no way affected by the defendant's claim. The fact that the defendant had declared his will in a solemn form to be read by the judge at his Nova Scotia estate estate estate hearing was sufficient to justify a single hearing."
d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposed the application and requested a summary trial. The Plaintiff opposed the Application and sought damages. Rule 488 sets out the test for summary judgement. The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavit material filed but rather, whether despite the contradictory evidence, the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would not otherwise be unjust to do so. The Court accepts the defendant's evidence wherever it conflicts with that of the plaintiff and still concludes the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. HELD: 1) Rule 486 of the Corollary Rules sets out what may constitute just cause in any particular case situation. Assuming all of the defendant’s evidence is true, have to agree with counsel for the plaintiff who characterized the plaintiff’�s conduct as “griping”, whether it related to the plaintiff being asked if he was prepared to assume both jobs, or if he felt qualified to do. Taking all factors into account, the Court considers this an appropriate notice period to which the plaintiff was entitled. 2) In the case of a person in the plaintiff's position, who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice period selected should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there is a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non- management one."
d_2000canlii19583.txt,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused was standing in front of the victim's car when he was punched in the face and the victim fell to the ground. Less than one minute later the victim was run over by a truck. The Crown called two disinterested witnesses to an event. The first was the 15-year-old mascot for the Raider Hockey Club. He was standing on the walkway at the rear of the seats cheering loudly. The second was that the accused and five others encountered the victim on the street. One of the others punched the victim and the other punched the man in the arm. The assault was deemed to be an assault on a bodily harm occasioning bodily harm. The defendant was convicted of assault causing death. HELD: The Court held that the deminimus test of causation did not violate s. 8 of the Charter and that the Court could properly find that the causation factor had been proved. The Court also held that there was a very short period of time elapsed between the assault and the bodily harm which was not a contributing cause. The evidence gathered was sufficient to support the conclusion that the assault was a contributing factor. The court also held in the affirmative that the second question was answered in the negative. While the bodily damage resulted directly from the effect of third parties falling on top of the accused, and the accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to the accused in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions, a very brief period of period of elapsed between assault and bodily harm is what is called 'time and otherwise' (see:'short period of duration between assault, which would have lasted longer if the assault had not occurred]""."

The applicant did not demonstrate an entitlement to injunctive relief on the second and third stages of the three stage test. The applicant demonstrated there was a serious question to be tried but failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm. The delay (the action was commenced February 16, 1998) was considered.

The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had breached the terms of the Technology Licensing Agreement. The defendants had then proceeded to enter into an exclusive marketing agreement with another defendant which prohibited them from marketing any potassium sulphide produced at the plaintiff's plant. The applicant sought injunctions against the defendant, the defendants and all of the defendants except for the plaintiff, the defendant's proposed business partner, the plaintiff Nylen, because they were not the only people claiming under or through the defendant to use the technology. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The defendant was found to have a proprietary interest in the scientific principles of ion exchange and crystallization. The Confidentiality Agreement was not a patented process. The fact that the plaintiff had not obtained sufficient assurances that the technology licensed to it by the defendant was not being used by the plaintiff was irrelevant. 2)The plaintiff was found liable for costs of the action. 3)The court ordered further injunctions and other ancillary relief ordered by way of injunction or otherwise as counsel may advise and the court may allow."

The degree of the overlap between the roles was clearly discernible. The extent to the overlap was discernible in the fact that statements made by the Respondent were often made in the context of other statements made against the respondent, and that the Respondents were often given advance notice of statements made, which they did not receive, and then were not permitted to sign.

Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","The husband applied to have the matrimonial home sold and ordered that the wife's belongings be returned to him after the payment of spousal support was made.

d_2006nssc73.txt,"Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.","The parties were married for four years and had four children. The petitioner had been employed as a taxi driver for many years and obtained a university degree. She worked part-time and then became a social worker. The parties had four young children, aged eight, 13 and 14. The respondent was employed as an executive with the federal government. He lived in the same apartment as the petitioner and had three children, two of which were with his daughter. The wife had recently graduated from university and was working part- time. She was the primary parent of the children. They had difficulty finding a suitable apartment. The husband, who was working long hours and lived in an apartment close to the children's school, often made arrangements to take the children to sporting events or stayed with a friend when they were away. The mother was often late or unable to attend school. The children's daily activities and activities were often disrupted by the husband's constant driving. The court found that it would be in the children best interests to remain in the home with the mother and that it was in the best interests of the parties to have their children primarily reside with the father."

The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping.

The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.",The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The Crown applied to have the initial statements made by the complainant admitted into evidence for the truth of their contents as an exception to the rule which excludes hearsay evidence. The facts were relatively straight-forward and the complainant was the common- law spouse of the accused for seven years. She was upset and crying. The accused asked that the police be called. The complainant was later seen by her neighbour. She said she was afraid of the police and that they would get aggressive. The police arrived within minutes of the complainant arriving at her home. She asked that they be called and she was upset. She also stated that she had fresh red marks on her neck and chest that corresponded with her description of the incident and that she was concerned that her boyfriend had punched her. The evidence was important to the Crown's case and there was no other means of obtaining that evidence. HELD: The test of reliability was met. The statements were admitted into the evidence as admissible. 1) The Court found that the test of necessity was met and the test for reliability was satisfied.  2) The accused's evidence was very important to his case and the court was no longer able to obtain that evidence through hearsay. The inconsistencies in the complainant's statements were aggravating factors. The fact that she is the common law spouse and she had no recollection of the assault and the whole night was blurring. The allegation that she slurred her speech and the police officer's opinion that she wasn't intoxicated to provide a credible statement was aggravating. The Court noted that the accused's subsequent jealous and possessive behaviour was another factor that could be considered supportive of reliability.
d_2007skqb324.txt,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with two counts of breaking and entering in relation to a private communications offence, the sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code and the abduction contrary to ss. 273(1(2)(c) being Schedule B to the Canada Act. The accused argued that the evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception was inadmissible because it was not contained in a sufficient file to warrant an exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: The evidence was in admissible and did not violate the accused's s. 8 rights. Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s.8, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. The Court found that the accused had reasonable and probable grounds to believe the accused committed the offences, the breach was inadvertent and was not the result of bad faith. The evidence did not breach s.24(2) of The accused's Charter rights and he argued that such an intention amounted to pure speculation and fell short of what could be considered reasonable grounds to belief that information would be obtained through the interception sought. The defence argued that because the offence was not specified in the authorization, the evidence ought to be classified as conscriptive. The court also considered the fact that the respondent had a spouse and was prepared to engage in conversation involving their alleged sexual activity that would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. The respondent argued that he had no evidence that he or she was subject to the conversation which was not being intercepted. The issue was whether the evidence should be excluded under s24(1). The Court held that there was no Charter breach and that the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Crown sought to exclude the evidence on a charge of breach of s8 because it is neither a charge listed in the definition section nor section of the Constitution Act nor is it a breach of the Charter. HELD:(1) The evidence is relevant and admissible in that it does not violate s8. Even though the evidence is non-consecutive evidence, the trial unfair. 1) The respondent's application to exclude evidence obtained pursuant to a valid authorization to intercept private communications was dismissed. 2) The Court concluded that there is no Charter breaches and that admitting the evidence will not bring into disuse the administration. 3) The intercept evidence was non-Conscriptive and did in fact not violate its s."
d_2008nssc145.txt,"The intestate's biological child, who was one of the personal representatives of the estate, wished to sue the intestate's former employer to have the pension to which he was entitled at the time of his death paid into the estate. The other personal representative of the estate, who was the intestate's spouse, was in receipt of survivor benefits under the pension and, as such, was opposed to the intended court action. The biological child applied to have his stepmother removed as a personal representative of the estate. Application dismissed; the removal of the personal representative would only be in the best interests of those persons interested in the estate if the intended lawsuit was feasible, which it was not. The estate was bound by the terms of the pension plan, which provided that the respondent was clearly entitled, as the spouse of the intestate, to survivor benefits and the payment of a lump sum into her estate if she died within five years of the intestate's retirement.","The Respondent was a spouse within the meaning of the Pension Benefits Standards Act and the Pension Security Standards Act but was separated from his wife, the biological mother of the applicants. The respondent was employed by Marine Atlantic for thirty-one years. During that period, the estate received no monies from the corporation. The applicants sought the removal of the personal representative, who was a former employee of the corporation, and a pension plan beneficiary, and therefore was not entitled to the survivor benefits. The Respondent applied for an order removing the personal representatives as they were in conflict. The applicant argued that the respondent should be removed as Adminstratrix of the Estate and that the estate should pursue an action in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia against the corporation and the corporation for payment into the estate of the pension plan entitlement earned by the Intestate and for reimbursement by the corporation of the amounts already paid to her. The estate opposed the application. The testator, who had been employed by the respondent for thirty years, was collecting the pension from the corporations at the time of his death. The Intestate was collecting it from the respondent at the respondent's death. Prior to his death, the Testator made arrangements with the corporation to designate himself as single. There is no documentary evidence that the Intisestate took any steps to change the Respondent's status in law to that of an Adminstrator of the estate. The application must fail. The deceased was the spouse of the Int Estate at the relevant time and the applicant was entitled to be paid survivor benefits pursuant to the plan. The intestate determined that the Respondente was not spouse within meaning of both the Pension Plan for Employees of the Corporation and the pension Benefits Standards act and therefore began paying survivor benefits to her prior to his passing. The two children were separated from their mother. The husband was separated and was separated form his wife. The wife was not the biological parent of the children. The parties were in a direct conflict. Priority and duration of the payments was an immediate benefit to the applicant which would be lessened if it were to be borne by the heirs, the Respondence would be required to bring action against herself in her personal capacity. The only reason to remove the applicant as personal representative of theestate was because the estate was in a position of direct conflict and the continuing payment of the survivor benefit is an immediate detriment to her which would lessen if it was to be divided amongst all of the heirs. Unless the Respondents agreed that the pension funds should be paid into the Estate"

The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath.","An appeal from a conviction in the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan that the appellant did, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The trial judge was in a position to test the credibility of the trial judge. In coming to his conclusion he considered the totality of the evidence, the trial Judge considered the facts. The trial court found that the trial officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath, and the appellant’s claim for breach of the Charter must fail. 2) The officer was in the position to assess the credibilityof the trial court due to an error in law. The decision of the judge was reasonable and supported by the evidence. It was not clear that the officer observed the bloodshot eyes of the respondent after making the formal arrest as argued by the appellant. 3) The evidence was not clearly observed by the respondent. The appellant”s bloodshot eye sockets were not observed after the arrest as they were noticeable after the officer had taken the respondent to the police vehicle. The respondent”d been seated in the police car and the officer was observing the appellant when she approached him. The officer”had been in a situation to test her credibility. The court found with respect to the blood-shot eyes that she was not certain if she had reasonable or probable grounds for making the demand.

d_2013skca10.txt,"The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, the Court declared him a long-term offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. He appealed from this sentence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The defendant was found not guilty of all the predicate offences. The Court found that the trial judge failed to give adequate consideration to the opinions of the two expert witnesses who both recommended he be declared a long term offender and that he be sentenced to an an indeterminedate sentence (Life). 2) The Court also found that in addition to the four offences of sexual assaulting, the defendant had also committed two acts of sexual misconduct against a prostitute which were of significant consequence to his risk of re-offending. The defendant had been in custody for more than five years. The offences occurred in an alley, parked in a back alley and they both proceeded to get into the van. The Defendant then drove into a back alleys, parked and drove into the complainant's neighbourhood. The complainant later attempted to escape the vehicle. The trial judge found that both the complainant and the accused had been familiar with the area and that both of these incidents constituted acts of extreme violence. The accused's behaviour was consistent with the pattern of repeated sexual assaults and the defendant was known to be persistent in his aggressive behavior. The court found that it would be impossible for the accused not to participate in sexual offender treatment if he was found to be a long time offender. The evidence established that the defendant vacillated between cooperation and submission. The judge failed both to give appropriate consideration to these expert witnesses' assessment and to the assessment of the defendant's rehabilitation. The appellant's rehabilitation was not complete and he would have to complete intense and long-time sexual offender programming. The issues were determined over a period of time (1) and 2) when the defendant would be free to move on from the sexual assault charges and would have completed his sentence within two years. 3) The Defendant was found guilty of both counts of sexually assault. The predicate offences were the same offences. He was sentenced to a life sentence. The new evidence was all that the Court required of him. The experienced corrections officer who had been with the defendant for four years and the experienced corrections employee who had worked with him for four and one half years were found to have been rehabilitative factors. The fact that the accused was found, even if he had been consistent in his behaviour, was enough to justify a sentence of an indonsequential amount of time. The principles of rehabilitation were not"
d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","The plaintiff union and its representatives republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The union and the plaintiff brought an action to recover general damages of $25,000. The trial judge found that the defamatory statements were protected by qualified privilege and fixed damages at $100,000 (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The plaintiff union appealed the trial judge's finding that the words were capable of bearing defamatories meaning notwithstanding the overarching labour relations context and that the plaintiff's and Union's complaints were entirelyfounded and without substance. The plaintiff's action against the union and union was dismissed. The court reviewed the history of labour relations and found that most of the defamed statements were published on the Union's website. It is not possible to conclude that the statements were defamed by the publication of the publications. The fact that the publications were published in part consisted of using the internet and other materials to communicate with its members, rather than relying upon traditional means of communication, meant that the trial court could not conclude that either the plaintiff or the union's statements had been defamed."
d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff, CN applied to the Court seeking orders that the defendants, Clarke Transport and Clarke Transport, answer certain questions which they refused to answer on discovery. The application raises interesting issues with respect to the proper scope of questioning or examination for discovery. HELD: 1) The Court found that when the defendants apply for the proper portion of the production and questioning to be conducted, matters relating to railcars previously loaded by Clarke are not an issue. The Court determined that the application was premature and unnecessary. The approach taken here of presenting several hundred pages of invoices and other documents and asking the defendant to advise which they say relate and do not relate to the derailment is of such nature and scale that it is not appropriate. The defendants are obliged to indicate their present positions and facts now known or believed to exist. 2) The application is premature and is entirely up to the court to decide whether to accommodate CN. It is clear that the insurance adjuster's file would be subject to a litigation privilege. The court found that the Court should not be required to answer questions that Clarke refused to provide. 3) The applicants' refusal to provide proper responses to questions that were asked of them was entirely within the scope of the Court's discretion. The applicant's refusal to answer specific questions was entirely in the course of preparing for a trial. The plaintiff is not required to assist plaintiffs to do so. 4) The applicant is entirely aware that the plaintiff has asked for a review of the invoicing and other invoiced documents and there are a number of situations in which it may be asked to provide specific answers. The information sought is entirely new information and the defendant is not obliged to provide answers to specific questions. 5) The court concluded that the applicant's failure to provide a proper response to questions which it refused to make available to the plaintiff was of the plaintiff's burden to prove its damages and a defendant is therefore not required or required to doso."

Even if proven, the damages were part of urban life. The plaintiff claimed for injunctive relief ordering the trees to be removed. The Court had no jurisdiction to grant this relief. The amended claim could proceed limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees into the plaintiff’s property and whether the trees invaded the plaintiff’s air space.",The plaintiff sues the defendant and seeks portions of the defendant's action struck. The defendant contends that overhanging trees from the plaintiff's property onto the defendant property invade the plaintiff’s yard. The plaintiff argues that debris from trees falling from the defendant’llow and other debris from the plaintiffs’ yard invade the defendant yard. Both applications were successful and the parties are currently self-represented. The court reviewed the principles enunciated in the Small Claims Act and found that both the plaintiff and defendant”s claims were frivolous and vexatious. The claim for damages from overhangs trees on the defendant parent’d property was dismissed. The issue was whether the claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action. HELD: The plaintiff” s claim was struck. 1) The defendant“s claim was dismissed on the basis that the plaintiff failed to establish what can be regarded as a nuisance (i.e. an inconvenience materially interfering with the ordinary physical comfort of human existence) and that the claim did not disclose a reasonable Cause of Action. The Court was also prepared to strike the portion of the plaintiff who claimed damages from tree felling on his property. 2) The plaintiff was awarded costs.
e_1991canlii4217.txt,"The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act. The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","Continental Seafoods applied for a refund of health services tax paid on refrigeration equipment which was installed in a new facility for pickled whole herring. The contract contained stringent quality specifications. The refrigeration unit was used to cool the pickled herring in a cooler facility for 28 to 45 days at a strictly controlled temperature of 0ºC to 2ºC. The applicant argued that the tax should not have been apportioned based on the use of the refrigeration facility. The Provincial Tax Commissioner allowed the objection in part and indicated that rebate of $14,467.43 would be paid to Continental. The appellant contended that the Minister and the Provincial Tax Commission were incorrect in not allowing the exemption for the refrigerated equipment in full. In issue was whether the tax paid should be refunded based upon the use or of the equipment in production. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the assessment for health services taxed was upheld. 1)In light of the recent changes in legislation, it was appropriate to raise the new point of law in a different way than before.  2)The Provincial Taxation Commissioner's decision to allow a refund on refrigerated refrigeration was not new. In fact, it is an old matter which was not properly addressed on appeal. 3)The use of a cold room in the process performed a function that was part of the manufacture or production of the product."

The Husband claimed that the value of the crop harvested was less than the farm expenses and resisted any change in the previous interim orders made. HELD: Application dismissed.

When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital. As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain. The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code.

The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT. The Crown applied to have the witness declared adverse pursuant to s. 9 of the Canada Evidence Act on the basis that she has demonstrated a hostile attitude towards the position of the Crown and hascontradicted in a substantial way, her prior video-taped statement to police officers made shortly after her arrest. The defence sought to use her prior statement as substantive evidence. HELD: 1)The credibility of the witness was determined with respect to her prior statements as to her conduct during and after her imprisonment. 2)The evidence of the complainant's employment as a probation officer was not an issue. The evidence of her employment as an employment officer was, by virtue of, not an adverse effect of her imprisonment on the credibility of her witnesses. 3)The reliability threshold was not met in the absence of an oath where appropriate substitutes for the oath exist. The reliability threshold is not met on the balance of probabilities. The credibility of a witness who is an unindicted co-conspirator in this matter is determined on thebalance of probabilities on the question of reliability. 4)The witness's prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its witnesses. 5)The statements of persons who are asked to cooperate with police are to be examined in the context of their credibility. 6)The affidavit evidence was not administered prior to the taking of the statement. 7)The affidavits were not given at the preliminary inquiry. 8)The Crown was given appropriate instructions with respect the evidence of an RCMP officer and the evidence a person who has provided consistent testimony. The affidavits had to be obtained in the manner contemplated by Lamer C.J. in R. v. K.G.B. (1993), 62 Cr.AppR. 14 (HELD): The reliability criteria were met. The affidavit was not relaxed on the part of the defence. The requirement of necessity was established. 9)The totality of the evidence did not affect the credibility test. 10)The unconditional statement offered by the complainant was not credible. 11)The circumstantial evidence was insufficient to establish that the credibility interval between the statements was unreliable. 12)The oath was not administer prior to taking the statement which did not establish credibility. The circumstantially supported affidavit evidence did have some support but not sufficient to establish its reliability. 11 (The reliability test was satisfied). 12)Costs were awarded."
e_1998canlii13359.txt,"The accused, employed as doorman and relief bartender at the time of the altercation, was charged with assault causing bodily harm in which the complainant sustained significant injuries to his head and face. Three crown witnesses and five defence witnesses testified as to the altercation in the bar. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The self-defence argument was not accepted. Neither s.34 or s.37 of the Criminal Code justified the assault. 2)The testimony of the Crown witnesses was accepted. The complainant was no threat to the accused in his inebriated state and the accused took advantage of the situation to administer a beating to him. The injuries were not consistent with the scenario described by the accused and the witnesses.","The accused was employed as a doorman and relief bartender at the Penitentiary. He met some friends and associates, and spent the night socializing and dancing. The accused was later employed as an employee as a bartender. He was later seen dancing and drinking. He claimed that the accused had asked him to 'bring it on' and that he had 'picked on' him. He alleged that the other accused had 'whipped him on the back' and said 'bring on the 'bitch' and he 'got violent'. HELD: The accused is guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The facts are as stated by the Crown witnesses, with the qualification that Baikie did indeed attempt to 'get at' the accused whilst being restrained by Layman. He may have thrown punch at the accused or attempted to do so but his efforts were quite ineffectual. In hisinebriated state, he was no threat to the accused and the accused took advantage of the situation to administer a 'beating to' to him. The evidence that the defence used force to prevent the accused from falling out of the rut and thereby preventing him from escaping harm's way is consistent with the accused's being a threat to himself and others. The defence took advantage in the situation and administered a 'bbeating' to the offence."
e_1998canlii13558.txt,"The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy on the grounds that he received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and because his assets had been undervalued. He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants. The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors. Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000. The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy. The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy. HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances. An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application. 2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. The onus will be on the bankrupt to comply with the requirements of the trustee to qualify for an automatic discharge on November 15/98 or an early discharge as provided for in s168.1(2).","The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy. Section 181 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act reads as ""(1) Where in the opinion of the court, a receiving order ought not to have been made on an assignment ought not have been filed, the court may by order annul the bankruptcy."" The bankrupt submits he received wrong legal advice concerning the status of the builders' lien claimants and secondly the undervaluation of his assets. HELD: The application by the bankrupt for an order annulling his assignment is dismissed. 1) An annulment of the assignment would be dangerous because it would result in the bankrupt being bankrupt for a period of time more expeditiously than it would otherwise take. Certain builders' liien claimants have already commenced an action. 2) The bankrupt has been far from a model bankrupt. He has yet to file monthly financial statements and has not made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. One of the conditions for the financing is that the bankrupt get out of bankruptcy. 3) There is likely merit to the bankrupt's contention that the bankruptcy proceedings have been of no value to him. It also appears from the facts that the majority of creditors, who are secured, would also benefit from the bankrupts request being granted. If the bankrupt were granted financing he would likely be far from model bankrupt but would have met the requirement to comply with his obligations. 4) The majority of the builder's lien claimant claimants have been pre-bankrupt and can pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds divided among theclaimants."

The issues before the court is interim custody and primary residence of the child, access by the other parent and interim child maintenance. The parties filed evidence that was considerably contradictory relating to each other and respective abilities as parent. viva voce hearing was held to assist determining the questions of credibility. The mother aged 31 years of age, is employed as secretary. The mother remained at home during the first year of the child's birth then returned to work. The mother suffered from post partum depression following the child's birth and as result attempted to commit suicide. She was hospitalized for three weeks to receive psychiatric assistance. The psychiatrist who treated the mother states the mother is unlikely to have future suicide attempts and has responded well to treatment. The child was with the mother every afternoon during her hospitalization and the mother bonded with her son. The father is currently employed at Ipsco on shift work and is currently living with his parents. The father has had the child since the separation and the child has had little access with his mother. HELD: The child's primary residence should be with the mother. Based on the information before the Court, the mother has always been the primary caregiver of the child and remained at home with the child for the first year of his life. The mother was responsible for the child's day to day needs, health care and child care. As well the father asserts that he was involved in the child's health care needs but was unable to name the child's pediatrician. The father will have access to the child for three days when he is not working including overnight access. The father's gross annual income is $48,897 which results in a payment to the mother for child maintenance in the sum of $393.00 payable on the first day of each and every month until further ordered by the Court. In addition the father will responsible for 75% of the child care expenses.","The parties sought interim custody of their 1 year old son. The respondent claimed that the respondent was clinically depressed and addicted to alcohol. She attempted to commit suicide two separate occasions following his birth. The petitioner alleged that the petitioner, who was an abusive man with an alcohol problem, was addicted to cocaine and had taken narcotics including crack cocaine. HELD: 1) The respondent was to have access by appointment only on the third day of each week. The Court found that the child had been adequately cared for during the first year of his life and that the primary caregiver was the petitioner. 2) The petitioner was to pay the respondent's pro-bono costs of $2,393.96 for the two child care costs that she was to maintain for the three days each week at his work. 3) The Court ordered that the two children remain in the same residence. The court found that it was in the petitioner's best interests to be in the custody of the petitioner to be held in the Custody/Primary Residence. 4) The child was to be cared for pro- bono for three days at his regular work time. 5) The court ordered that a gross income of $48,393 be paid out to the petitioner for the purposes of the interim care costs. The child's medical expenses should be paid in accordance with the petitioner's income."
e_1999canlii6888.txt,"The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales. The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by the defendant. The defendant had sold a number of dairy products prior to the 1988 quota scheme change. The three brothers each formed a new company at that time with the intention of transferring all three assets of their company to the defendant and having them each own a separate company. The purpose of the new company was to be more stable and more profitable. The court found that the agreement was not based on a quota system but on a real estate transaction. The agreement provided that the three brothers would have joint control of the dairy operation with the defendant, with the exception of one brother, and that the defendant would have the exclusive right to sell only the one product per quota. The plaintiff was to have his shares divided equally. The defendants refused to honour the agreement. The plaintiffs sought to have the agreement divided according to the value of the assets in the company and the defendant's proposed sale of the rest of the quota to the plaintiff. The Court found that both parties were in a conflict of interest and that it was improper for the defendant to divide the proceeds of the sale of one product in the first place. The provisions of the 1988 agreement were found to be in breach of the provisions of section 29 of the Trade Offering Act. Section 29 of The Trade Off Offering Agreement was found to have been breached by the plaintiff because the agreement referenced only one product and the words 'fluid milk Quota'. The agreement clearly stated that the two products were to be equally owned and the proceeds would be shared equally among the three. The terms of the 1989 agreement were not disclosed to the court."
e_1999skqb151.txt,"The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","The primary issue was whether the Agreement was a lease or a security agreement. The central issue was between the parties whether the agreement was a leasing or a Security agreement. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. The defendant was awarded costs on the basis of Column D of the Tariff of Costs. 1)The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively show that Mr. Poirier acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. The trade-in value was $23,650.00 being 25% of the agreed value as down payment and $23 in the amount of advance payment of $9,320.67 to be paid at Mr.Poirier's option if he elected to purchase the sprayers. 2)The trade-ins were not nominal amounts but the value of the trade- in did not equal the amount the advance payment and the difference being $679.33 was $10,000. 3)The termination value was not determined by the anticipated value of June 2002 but the trade in was 25% and the value would depend upon market fluctuations. The option payment of a $23k650.01 did not appear to be a nominal amount but in the absence of evidence it was a deferred down payment. The difference being between $10 and $9.33 would be a factor in the Ontario Equipment case. The court must be able to ascertain the probable value of sprayer at the end of the Agreement in June 2002 and, in light of the evidence that it depends on market fluctuations, cannot determine whether the option price would be substantially less than the fair market value in June, 2002 or equivalent to it, or more.  4)The plaintiff was awarded $42,089.00 with costs on a basis of column D of Tariff Of Costs."
e_2000nsca53.txt,"The appellant and respondent lived together in common law relationship for approximately ten years. Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets. They separated in 1995. The appellant brought an application under s. 275 of the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of assets. She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship. The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect. This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter.","The appellant and the respondent lived together for ten years. They had two children out of this relationship. The respondent separated in 1995. The appellant commenced an application under the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of the parties' assets. In conjunction with that application, the appellant sought a declaration that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is infringed by the definition of'spouse' in s. 2(g) of the MPA. The applicant argued that s.2(g] discriminates against her as a common law spouse on the basis of one or more personal characteristics. The parties lived together in a 'common law relationship' for approximately ten years and had two sons. The petitioner obtained a mortgage on the home which was registered in the appellant's name. The application was dismissed. The court assumed the facts to be analogous to the claims made in Miron v. Bona and concluded that the appellant had no rights to any share of it on marriage breakdown. The claim for a differential treatment of the appellant and respondent on the same basis was not advanced. The Chambers judge concluded that both parties were entitled to unequal treatment and that the infringement was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. The issue of the analogous ground proposed in this case marital status touches the essential dignity and worth of the individual in the same way as other recognized grounds of discrimination violative of fundamental human rights norms. This is a matter of defining importance to individuals. It is not matter which party has the right to a similar status quo. The unequal treatment of a spouse on a marriage breakdown is analogous to discrimination within the ambit of s.15(1). The unequal distribution of property among spouses is analogous. The advantages conferred by marriage are not analogous to those conferred by the MAA. The disadvantages inflicted on the unmarried partner have ranged from social ostracism through denial of status and benefits to economic prosperity and growing dissatisfaction with the traditional roles assigned to married women. The pre-existing spousal relationship was in all ways a traditional and fairly long term relationship."
e_2005skqb263.txt,"Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","The accused was charged with second degree murder contrary to s. 235 after she was confronted by the husband who had sexually assaulted her and threatened to kill her if she dropped the assault and sexual assault charges. The Crown tendered statements by the deceased to several Crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents of choking. The defence argued that s. 589 of the Criminal Code should be considered bar to the admissibility of the statements made by the accused to her friends, family and co-workers as well as for the hearsay statements made to her friend, family members and co‑workers. HELD: The evidence is admissible on a principled basis and it should not be admitted in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value and it must not be admit in order for the trial judge to determine the admissible factor. 1) The Court must not invade the province of a trier of fact and condition admissiblilty on whether the evidence is ultimately reliable. However, it will need to examine whether the circumstances in which the statement was made lend sufficient credibility to allow a finding of threshold reliability. 2) The evidence falls within the category of similar fact as similar factEvidence as defined by the relevant Supreme Court principles. The principles identified in Khan were not to be confined to children's evidence in the sense that the two previous occurrences of choking were extremely prejudicial in nature and there is a serious potential for moral prejudice. The evidence could be used to show hostile behaviour by the defendant that would lead to a motive to kill and it could also be used as a basis for adduce the evidence. The Court emphasized the importance of issue identification and held that it must be careful to focus on the issues to be proved. The court was only concerned with finding that the evidence was admissible as a similar fact Evidence in this case."
e_2007skqb225.txt,"The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived. The appeal is made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The imposition of a victim fine surcharge under s. 737 of the code is mandatory subject only to an application under s. 737(5) relating to undue hardship. If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim surcharge, it is also mandatory that the Court give reasons. The sentence is varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $30.","The Crown appealed the sentence of $200.00 for breach of probation and a $30 victim surcharge waived. The sentence was based on the respondent's failure or refusal to comply with a mandatory anger management program. The sentencing judge waived the surcharge. HELD: The sentence is varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim sur charge in the amount of $30. The surcharge was waived notwithstanding that the respondent had not requested an exemption pursuant to s. 737(5) of the Code. The Crown gave reasons for the reduction in the sentence. 1) The sentencing court has consistently and consistently raised the issue of surcharges in the courtroom. This is particularly important in circumstances where a judge has consistently raised surcharges and challenges the entire criminal justice system, particularly in the context of undue hardship. This was particularly true when the sentencing judge had specifically and consistently failed to meet the maximum surcharge imposed on an adult under the Criminal Code. 2) The sentence varied to reflect an order that the sentencing officer must pay a $20 victim surcharges. 3) The maximum surcharges are paid by the Crown in all circumstances. This reflects the fact that the entire system of sentencing judges is employed to ensure that the maximum amount of surcharge is paid. This particular sentencing judge has clearly and consistently exceeded the maximum imposed on offenders. He has consistently failed the victims' financial obligations and has raised important but not essential issues that are of vital importance to the criminal justice community. This sentencing judge was also employed to raise the maximum amounts of surpluses by the entire court system."
e_2007skqb367.txt,"The plaintiff is an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Union. He commenced this claim based on the Indemnity Clause contained in the Union's bylaws. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the union for breach of its by-laws and alleged breach of contract by the union in violating hiring hall rules. The union resisted the claim and brought an application for summary judgment. HELD: The Court has jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff's claim and his application under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgement. 1) The dispute in the Fourth Action involves a contractual debate concerning the meaning and scope of an indemnity clause. This is substantially different from an internecine dispute in a voluntary sports organization respecting the disciplining of high school coach over recruiting practices. Nothing in the Union by-law precludes the plaintiff from seeking relief from the Courts before making a final appeal to the CUPE National office. 2) The essential nature of the debate between the union and the officer is a contractual dispute. This reflects the essence of the union's by-laws. The essential character of the dispute is that the plaintiff is entitled to the benefits of the indemnity by-loan in the union by-lamented by the officer. Nothing within the Union's by laws precludes him from seeking assistance from the Court before making his final appeal. 3) In the absence of a statutory regime precluding the Court's involvement, the debate in the fourth action is totally appropriate for disposition by the Court."
e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children (ages twelve and ten). The respondent applied to vary the period of retroactive child support to reflect his actual income, which was greater than the respondent's s.7 expenses for the younger child. The respondent argued that although he did not receive formal notice of the petitioner's application until October 2008, his counsel did not get the relevant documents until October 8, 2008 and the retroactive recalculation should be limited to three years prior to October 9, 2008. The petitioner also claimed that the respondent should have made more informed decisions about his/her support obligations. The court did not have jurisdiction to consider the application of the respondent for retroactive variation of child support and a readjustment of the claim for section 7 expenses pertaining to the parties' older child."
e_2009skca138.txt,"This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed.","The appellant company appealed a decision of the city assessessor, pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act, that the city had misapplied or misconstrued the importance of the sale of a shopping mall. The mall was owned by the appellant company, which was dissatisfied with the City Assessor's determination of its fair value and appealed the assessment to the Assessment Appeals Committee. The Committee found that the City had not erred in law in upholding the Assessor’s decision to value the mall as an arm’ve length sale, and that the sale price complied with all of the requirements of the Assessment Manual. The appeal was allowed and the assessor was ordered to re-examine the assessment, especially in light of the removal of the Northgate Mall from the array of sales from which the MAF was to be derived. The amount paid by the Committee was not certain of the amount paid pursuant to Document 1.1.6. The importance lies in the fact municipal assessors are highly dependent on the information at his command, including the information supplied to him by the parties to the transaction. Thus the Committee erred by failing to recognize that the mall did not amount to an arm's length sale because the Assessor was not a willing buyer. The sale price was determined in accordance with the terms of the assessment manual. The committee found that, even assuming the Committee’d been right in dismissing the assessment and finding that the sales of the mall in such a fashion as to be reasonable and reasonable, the sale would not have satisfied the Committee members’ duty of adjustment. The assessment was upheld on the basis of the sales verified information provided by the assessessor. The company did not misapprehend the importance, generally, of the Sale Verification Information and the information it yielded. The important lies in fact municipal assessmentors are regarded as highly dependent upon the information provided to them by the party to the sale. The fact the sale involved only 50% interest, making it necessary to adjust the sale prices accordingly. The party that appealed did not find any material error on the part of the Committee."
e_2010skqb108.txt,"The plaintiffs have applied for certification of proposed multi-jurisdictional class action involving Paxil, prescription drug approved in Canada for the treatment of depression, anxiety, panic disorder and other conditions. The plaintiffs claim that Paxil is ineffective and harmful to persons under 18 years of age. The defendant applies for leave to cross-examine the representative plaintiff on his affidavit pursuant to Rule 317 of The Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The decisions reviewed by the Court all support the view that leave to cross-examine under Rule 317 is granted more readily in proposed class actions than it is in other civil proceedings. None support the proposition that proposed representative plaintiff is immune from cross-examination in respect of his or her individual claim. Cross-examination of proposed representative plaintiff may explore matters pertaining to his or her individual claim in the context of issue that must be determined by the court pursuant to s. and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act. A cross-examination of the plaintiff in this case may assist the court in applying the criterion set out in s. 6 and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act. The application for leave to cross-examine is granted.","The plaintiffs applied for certification of a proposed multi-jurisdictional class action involving Paxil (Paxil). The plaintiffs claim that Paxil is ineffective and harmful to persons under 18 years of age. An affidavit filed by the respondent states that there was an increased risk of adverse events including but not limited to suicide, suicidal tendencies, aggressiveness, hostility and mania associated with the use of Paxil but have continuously failed to warn consumers. HELD: The application for cross-examination is granted. The cross- examination is permitted on the basis that an order for cross examination under Rule 317(1) is an exceptional discretionary remedy that should not be granted routinely in any action, including a proposed class action. It will take place at a time and place that is reasonably convenient for the applicant and will not result in an injustice to the respondent. The applicant has assured the court that the proposed cross-examinations will be conducted at any reasonable location chosen by the applicant for the purpose of compiling an evidentiary record and will be of assistance to the court in applying the criterion set out in ss. 6 and 6.1 of the Class Actions Act."
e_2010skqb464.txt,"The defendant contracted with the plaintiff for supply and installation of materials. The defendant was not satisfied with the plaintiff's work, hired a third party to fix the plaintiff's work and refused to pay the plaintiff. The plaintiff sued for payment of the outstanding account HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The Court found enough evidence to conclude that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that there was a breach of the implied condition that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard. As the plaintiff's workmanship constitutes a breach of contract, the defendant's damages are set off against the claim.","The plaintiff obtained a lien under the Builders' Lien Act for the services of the defendant. The defendant agreed to supply and install drip capping, mitring, soffit and facia. The plaintiff contended that the defendant had not provided the materials necessary to perform the job. The lawyer brought a motion seeking leave to enter final judgment against the defendant in the amount of $2,800 with interest to date of judgment and judgment entitling the plaintiff to maintain his lien. The action was set down for summary trial with no examinations for discovery or pre-trial conference and the procedure at trial would be simplified."
e_2012skca69.txt,"The applicant applied for judicial interim release under s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed.","The accused applies for judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. The accused was a Roma and Romanian national who had resided in Canada since his arrival here exactly eight years ago. In 2002, the accused was killed when his car struck and killed a pedestrian in Romania. The victim, a Romanian national, was later apprehended and he admitted consuming alcohol and striking the victim. The defendant was later charged with criminally negligent homicide and leaving the scene of an accident. The Court found that the accused had not committed any wrongs and, although he had been detained by Canadian authorities for approximately 7 weeks, he had not shown that he was fleeing Romania to seek refugee protection. The application for judicial inter-arrival was dismissed on the basis that the Court could not determine that the sureties proffered by the accused were not frivolous. The fact that the defendant had no real property and had identified no significant activities that connected him to the jurisdiction where he resided was not an issue. The court found that it would be non-sensical for the accused not to be returned to Romania given the current circumstances. The issue of the accused's non-appearance was also raised. The appellant's application for interim judicial release was also dismissed. The issues before the Court were: 1) the accused should not be extradited; 2) the Court must determine whether the accused has met the low threshold for non- reappearance that must be met in extradition proceedings; and 3) the onus must be placed on the accused to establish his bona fides. The most recent decision in Németh v. Canada (Justice), 2010 SCC 56 (CanLII), leads one to the conclusion that Canada's legal obligations under the Convention with respect to non-refoulement displace the limiting effect of its legal obligations as a result of his conviction in that country for criminally negligent negligence; 4) the issue of costs should be considered in the application for bail. The appeal of the conviction was dismissed."
