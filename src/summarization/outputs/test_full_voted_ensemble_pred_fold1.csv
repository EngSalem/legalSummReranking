The disputes are generally conducted in civil fashion as evidenced by the Sheas' consent to late filing of the Notice of Contest and the Bowsers' consent of late filing the Rebuttal Affidavit.

The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib. The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence. Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge. The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assault with a weapon contrary to s.268(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused claimed that he struck the accused in self-defence. Absent consideration of defence evidence, the Crown evidence clearly establishes a prima facie case inasmuch as that evidence establishes that the accused intentionally struck and thereby applied force to the complainant causing him to suffer wounds. The issue to be determined is whether, despite the claim of self defence and evidence adduced in support of the Crown, the accused was justified in using force to prevent what he perceived as a trespass upon his property provided he used no more force than was necessary to prevent the perceived trespass.

In light of how Mr. Colley saw Mr. Simmons’ intention to use the rifle or shotgun, I am unable to believe that Mr. Colley could ever have thought that he was facing an imminent attack when Mr. Simmons stepped toward him holding the knife or that Mr. Simmons would throw the knife at him if he retreated fully from Mr. Simmons’ property. [21] In conclusion, I find Mr. Colley guilty of all three charges. However, based upon the principles expressed in the R. v. Kienapple (1974) 1974 CanLII 14 (SCC), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 524 decision, a conviction should enter upon only the S.268 aggravated assault.",0.3838862559241706,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assault with a weapon contrary to s.268(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused claimed that he struck the accused in self-defence. Absent consideration of defence evidence, the Crown evidence clearly establishes a prima facie case inasmuch as that evidence establishes that the accused intentionally struck and thereby applied force to the complainant causing him to suffer wounds. The issue to be determined is whether, despite the claim of self defence and evidence adduced in support of the Crown, the accused was justified in using force to prevent what he perceived as a trespass upon his property provided he used no more force than was necessary to prevent the perceived trespass. HELD: The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault, assault by wounding and possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace contrary to ss.267(a) and s.88.

b_1996canlii7148.txt,"A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident. The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued. An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found. A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation. The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act. SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview. It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event. HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.  1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs. Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate. The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke. On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate. The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction. Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate. Estoppel was not applicable. Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act. The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages. These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1). They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4). Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle. As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).  3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear. A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.  4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.","This was a claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased motor vehicle arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff had taken the vehicle to Saskatchewan Government Insurance (SGI) Claims Centre and an SGI adjuster appraised the damage to the vehicle. The insurer deducted from the replacement cost, 20% for depreciation or 'betterment'. The 20% deduction for depreciation amounted to $503.73. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) of the Act amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair the vehicle, regardless of the cost to repair or replace the exhaust system as fixed by regulations. 2)Where an insurer acts for the purpose of ascertaining the extent of loss or damage, or to substitute a different mode of discharging their liability, the insurer is deemed to have elected to reinstate. This is not an election under which it is bound to pay or reinstate by its conduct. There may be a binding election by conduct where the insurer has so conducted themselves as to mislead the assured into thinking that they intend to reinstate. However, this is not the case here. A reinstatement under a motor vehicle insurance contract is a different election under the Act. An election under a different type of insurance contract (e.g. fire, burglary, plate glass, steam boilers, etc.) refers to the formal preliminary proof of loss and not to the actual value of the property damaged or destroyed. 3)The definition of an 'election' has received its own treatment. It may be made an express term of the policy that the insurers are not called upon to elect, unless and until they have obtained all the necessary information, and all such plans and estimates as may be deemed necessary or expedient. The statutory scheme is quite clear. 4)Reinstatement clauses are included in insurance contracts for the benefit of the insurer. The benefits to the insurer are that a reinstatement clause provides the insurer with an option to choose the least expensive means of complying with the insurance policy. In Lepin, the basis for finding an election to repair was the insurer's conduct as manifested by its control over the repairs and repairers. It is not unreasonable to expect that the insurer would elect to repair a vehicle if and until it had all the materials before them requisite for their guidence [sic] in deciding which of the two courses open to them would be more advantageous. 5)An express election is not necessary. An insurer's election to fix is an election.","This is a claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased

The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver.

The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship.

O. is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley’s life given her previous role in raising the child. [117] I am satisfied that J. O. is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley’s life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley’s parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the Court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. When the Court considers the quality of the relationship that has and continues to exist between Hayley and J. O., I am satisfied that an independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley’s best interests. Though there is a scarcity of evidence about Hayley’s personality, character and emotional needs, the history and intensity of Hayley’s relationship with J. O. weighs in favour of specifying access for J. O. It is not within J. O.’s right of access to interfere with G. K.’s parenting and C. H.’s access as defined and determined in this judgment. J. O. must refrain from any criticism of either G. K., Patricia Kuntz, or C. H. in Hayley’s presence. To therefore balance these competing claims, J. O. shall have Hayley the last weekend of each calendar month commencing 5:00 p.m. Friday and ending 8:00 p.m. the following Sunday where such weekends do not conflict with C.

When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation. HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality. The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff. There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff.

He was entitled to pre-judgment interest on the sum of $61,608 from the date of judgment.  1)The plaintiff was an organic farmer from the Kamsack region of Saskatchewan. At the time of entering into this contract, he had the necessary certificates of conformity required to be certified organic in Canada, the United States and Europe. The documents submitted by Bio Canada, purportedly copies of the German documentation, were not admitted into evidence. 2)There was no legal reason why Bio Canada should not have made payment of the entire sum owing to Wlaswich. There was no evidence that the farmer had complied with his contractual obligations to the company, was required to provide oats with a certain quality standard, or that there was nothing further required of him in order to be paid the money owed.  3)Wlaswich was aware that Bio Canada was reselling his oats. Bio Canada did not explain how they came to pay him $10,000 even though it was not a party to that contractual obligation which was incurred solely by the company. It is clear in Canada that no one but the parties to contract can be bound by it.  4)HELD: Costs of the action were to be taxed on a party-party basis under Schedule I of the Tariff of Costs.","The German miller rejected some of the oats as having a high moisture content, the miller refused to pay the defendant, and the defendant refused to pay the farmer.

d_2013skca22.txt,"The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied.

The Chambers judge was acting in his capacity as an Administrative Judge appointed pursuant to the Court Administration Protocol (CAP) established as part of the settlement of the Indian Residential Schools litigation. In issue is approximately $20 million in legal fees, disbursements and interest which MLG is claiming, and the prospective respondent seeks verification of the claim. MLG challenges the Administrative Judge's order ordering MLG to contact ESI Software, Inc. and arrange for ESI to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as whole from the 'live data' for the residential schools litigation. The parties see the implementation of the VA as at Step 1. Both parties relied on hearsay evidence and an application for directions is simply an informal procedural step to ensure the verification process moves along. Any allegations of delay by MLG are simply unfounded and in applying the test for the granting of leave, the Court of Appeal makes an impugned order clearly within its jurisdiction. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. 1) Contrary to the argument of MLG, the amount of fees to be paid to MLG is reasonable and equitable taking into consideration the amounts and basis on which fees are being paid to other lawyers in respect to this settlement. The Administrative Judge directed the parties to determine how verification could be completed without breaching solicitor client privilege. 2) There was no issue of importance requiring the attention of the Court on the issue of the evidence or information upon which the administrative judge relied.

Dealing with the third argument of the applicant, in the Court’s view there is no abuse of process based on the principle of res judicata. In summary, the applicants have not satisfied the Court that it is plain and obvious that the statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action and would therefore dismiss the application. [25] The appellants apply for leave to appeal, and if granted, appeal from the judgment on the grounds that Justice Tidman erred in law by not striking out the originating notice and statement of claim: [94] In conclusion, it is my opinion, that the claims advanced against the Board, and the individual appellants (other than chairman Darby), clearly arise from actions taken in their capacity as Board, or as Board members, and that those actions are protected by the statutory immunity. [112] In my opinion, Justice Tidman erred when he:
- concluded that all questions of law, including questions where the law is clear, should not be brought before the Court in a s.14.25 application;
- determined that the constitutional question posed by Future Inns had not yet been clearly answered by the courts;
- determined that the extent of the immunity of the Labour Relations Board, and its members, except for the allegations against chairman Darby, was unclear.

9_1994canlii7210.txt,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","The defendants were charged with permitting a private building or facility, to remain on public reserve land contrary to both the provisions of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. HELD: The charges were stayed as an abuse of the legal process and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under Sec. 15 of the Charter. 1) The defendants had been singled out from among a great number of offenders for prosecution for, as they see it, no good reason. 2) Although the defendants' activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as it was an abuse and violation of the rights of the people involved in their equally unauthorized uses of public land, with an eye to their respective self-interest. 3) The only regulation made under subsec. (f), inasmuch as it says that: “A public reserve or municipal reserve may be used for any purpose that would facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area.” 4) The actual wording of the charges to so describe them was that: 1) Prior to the enactment of the interim zoning bylaw in 1986, permission from the Municipality had to be obtained if their zoning bylaws did apply, in law, to public reserves. The municipality did not seek permission from anyone. Rather, it took the position that the expense of maintaining the reserves was the responsibility of the municipality, despite the fact that the Province was the titleholder. The civil liabilities of the interested parties for trespass to public or municipal reserves were not directly in issue. The Municipality stepped into that position. 5) The municipality was responsible for maintenance on public reserves, not policing Sec. 197 and, in some cases, for the development of boathouses and other constructions. In the event of widespread violations, great expense and controversy was predictable. The real question was whether any given council chose to act out of respect for law, or pressures to enforce.","THE ISSUE 1) The Defendants are charged with permitting a private building or facility, to wit: a boat house, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of Sec. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983, and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. 3) They say the bylaws of the Resort Village are inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded “equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination …” under Sec. 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It may be that a municipality might seek to even further restrict permitted uses on the strength of its rights as a land owner, but I do not see how it could have jurisdiction to allow uses not permitted by Sec. 197. 98) Council also took the view that prosecution in respect of boathouses instead of other apparent violators, such as shed owners, was appropriate because it was boathouses that had resulted in the complaint, and they were a very private use, analogous to sheds, whereas with respect to other uses, such as walkways, docks, firepits, etc., it could be argued did not violate Sec. 197, as they could at least be utilized by the public at large. 108) The defendants see the selection of themselves as the only ones to be prosecuted out of such a large number of apparent violators, for no reason that they believe could be viewed as sufficient, as, in itself, unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of Sec. 15 of the Charter. Applications made by the defendants to the Department of Parks for permission to build things on the foreshore, which were based on misleading diagrams, are not material to the public reserve. 141) The case turns, as they themselves say, on the question of whether it is an abuse of the legal process to prosecute them when so many other apparent violators have not been charged, or a case of violating their rights under Sec. 15 of the Charter. 159) Secondly, a restrictive interpretation does not give the defendants a defence to the charge in any event, as their boathouses are not open for use by the general public. 160) In short, they have constructed a private facility on a public reserve. That is not a permitted use under Sec. 197, even interpreting it as Mr. Nanson does, and, accordingly, their boathouses are illegal under Sec. 221(1)(a)(ii). I find that council proceeded against the defendants it chose because it seemed sensible to them to do so, not because of any mala fides. 202) If I am wrong in concluding that the delay did not prejudice the defendants, the delay which I find to be unsatisfactorily explained was by that of the Department of Municipal Affairs, not the council. However, in my view, there were no unreasonable post charge delays in this case, given its complexity. 208) Thus, in my view, there is no reason to stay these proceedings on the grounds that they constitute an abuse of the legal process, least of all when the defendants, along with other apparent violators, deliberately took their chances on being prosecuted. 214) I know of no decision that says that it is discrimination, contrary to Sec. 15, to pick out individuals to prosecute as a test case to ascertain the state of the law, where there is no evidence that it has been done on the basis of improper consideration such as personal characteristics. In my view, there has been no showing of the type of discrimination prohibited by Sec. 15. 222) Picking out boathouse builders rather than shed builders is not an example of discrimination of the type prohibited by Sec. 15, as I understand it and the case law. 223) Thus, in my view, Sec. 15 has not been violated and no stay of the proceedings should be granted on the view that it has been. 226) Thus, in my view, the proceedings should not be stayed, because there has been no violation of Sec. 15 and, if I am wrong in that regard, because, in any event, it is not “appropriate and just” that such a remedy be granted in the circumstances present here.",0.469067405355494,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay.

The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","The defendants were charged with permitting a private building, to wit: a boat house, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. HELD: The charges were stayed as an abuse of the legal process and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 1) The defendants did not deny it, although they did require the crown to prove it, as has been done. They say the bylaws of the resort Village are inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed. 2) The municipality stepped into that position. Moreover, it could be argued that after the enactment of the interim zoning bylaw in 1986, permission from the municipality had to be obtained if their zoning bylaws did apply, in this case, to public reserves. The municipality had set up a situation whereby it created public reserves in front of cottage lot owners, the very people most likely to see themselves as justified in encroaching on public reserves, and the Government's rights as landowner, which would be used as precedent by other cottage owners to justify doing whatever they liked on a public reserve. However, the Department took the position that the expense of maintaining the reserves was the responsibility of the municipality, despite the fact that the Province was the titleholder. 3) The Municipality stepped into the position of assuming the Department's responsibilities for enforcement of landowners' rights, and their benefits to the public, involved in their equally unauthorized uses of public land, with an eye to their respective self-interest. 4) In this case the municipality did not seek to prosecute the defendants. Rather, the charges were made under subsec. (f), inasmuch as it says that: 1) the defendants are charged. The charges are dismissed. 5) There is no evidence to suggest that the municipality was aware of the nature of the reserve, nor that it was prepared to act under the possible authority of them. 6) There are access walkways to such public reserves between cottage lots, set aside on the plan of survey, unless one is familiar with the survey one would not even be likely to realize that public reserve exists, let alone realize how to access it from the landside without trespassing on cottage lots. 7) It was agreed that the boathouse would","THE ISSUE 1) The Defendants are charged with permitting a private building or facility, to wit: a boat house, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of Sec. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983, and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. 3) They say the bylaws of the Resort Village are inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded “equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination …” under Sec. 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It may be that a municipality might seek to even further restrict permitted uses on the strength of its rights as a land owner, but I do not see how it could have jurisdiction to allow uses not permitted by Sec. 197. 98) Council also took the view that prosecution in respect of boathouses instead of other apparent violators, such as shed owners, was appropriate because it was boathouses that had resulted in the complaint, and they were a very private use, analogous to sheds, whereas with respect to other uses, such as walkways, docks, firepits, etc., it could be argued did not violate Sec. 197, as they could at least be utilized by the public at large. 108) The defendants see the selection of themselves as the only ones to be prosecuted out of such a large number of apparent violators, for no reason that they believe could be viewed as sufficient, as, in itself, unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of Sec. 15 of the Charter. Applications made by the defendants to the Department of Parks for permission to build things on the foreshore, which were based on misleading diagrams, are not material to the public reserve. 141) The case turns, as they themselves say, on the question of whether it is an abuse of the legal process to prosecute them when so many other apparent violators have not been charged, or a case of violating their rights under Sec. 15 of the Charter. 159) Secondly, a restrictive interpretation does not give the defendants a defence to the charge in any event, as their boathouses are not open for use by the general public. 160) In short, they have constructed a private facility on a public reserve. That is not a permitted use under Sec. 197, even interpreting it as Mr. Nanson does, and, accordingly, their boathouses are illegal under Sec. 221(1)(a)(ii). I find that council proceeded against the defendants it chose because it seemed sensible to them to do so, not because of any mala fides. 202) If I am wrong in concluding that the delay did not prejudice the defendants, the delay which I find to be unsatisfactorily explained was by that of the Department of Municipal Affairs, not the council. However, in my view, there were no unreasonable post charge delays in this case, given its complexity. 208) Thus, in my view, there is no reason to stay these proceedings on the grounds that they constitute an abuse of the legal process, least of all when the defendants, along with other apparent violators, deliberately took their chances on being prosecuted. 214) I know of no decision that says that it is discrimination, contrary to Sec. 15, to pick out individuals to prosecute as a test case to ascertain the state of the law, where there is no evidence that it has been done on the basis of improper consideration such as personal characteristics. In my view, there has been no showing of the type of discrimination prohibited by Sec. 15. 222) Picking out boathouse builders rather than shed builders is not an example of discrimination of the type prohibited by Sec. 15, as I understand it and the case law. 223) Thus, in my view, Sec. 15 has not been violated and no stay of the proceedings should be granted on the view that it has been. 226) Thus, in my view, the proceedings should not be stayed, because there has been no violation of Sec. 15 and, if I am wrong in that regard, because, in any event, it is not “appropriate and just” that such a remedy be granted in the circumstances present here.",0.5103092783505154,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski).

HELD: 1)The plaintiff's injuries were not pre-existing injuries or to two mishaps that pre-date the collision. 2)The court was unable to accept the expert's opinion as to the cause of the pain. 3)The Court was not prepared to accept Dr. Danilkewich's expert opinion on causation of injury in the lower back.,0.4939271255060728
5_2014skpc78.txt,"Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son. The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband. The parties were separated. The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child. After this RCMP were contacted. On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained. During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it. They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach. Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography. The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO. The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above. However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”. When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home. She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house. She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle. During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures. He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs. Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant. Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included. The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her. The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction. The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources. The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model. The purpose of including the information was not made clear. The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore. The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused. Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him. The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?  HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and invitation to sexual touching contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The accused alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son, specifically massaging her in the nude while an adult male took photographs of the occurrence. During the search, the accused covered her breasts and vagina, in whole or part, and that her son did not touch her on those areas but did so elsewhere. There was also a misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures searched for that suggested an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The affidavit also failed to differentiate information and belief and was potentially confusing for justice weighing the information. The cumulative effect of these errors was that the accused could not, in the form presented, support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially. The above conclusion therefore renders the warrant to search a nullity, and the search unlawful. The search of the computer immediately without further authorization and/or without providing their return to the justice as set out in the final lines of a warrant render the search illegal.","c. Was the search of the computer conducted immediately on the premises legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu, supra, or because of the wording of the warrant itself, that directed that items seized were to be returned to the issuing or another justice? The cumulative effect of these errors, in my opinion, permit a conclusion that the ITO could not, in the form presented, support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially. The above conclusion therefore renders the Warrant to Search a nullity, and the search unlawful. The foregoing does not appear to have been done with deliberate bad faith, but shows poor investigation and negligence in not presenting fully information to the justice, and a low standard in the execution of the warrant. In the present case, it was not only a computer that was unlawfully searched, but the entire home of the Accused that was unlawfully searched. She was excited and confrontational, and as a result was arrested and removed from her house, and told that she would be charged with obstruction, a charge that is not before the Court. The errors and omissions in the ITO go beyond ordinary inadvertence and constitute careless and negligent drafting and poor investigation as outlined. Further, even with the impugned evidence, the outcome is by no means clear and certain.",0.5209302325581395,"Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code.

All evidence of a failure of the defendant to discharge his duty of care to the client and consequently, his negligence is dismissed. 4) The court found that the defendant was aware that the Trimark fund would not recognize a designated beneficiary but that the conclusion of the transaction of the applicant was dependent on it being a non-registered plan. The failure of Nordstrom to act in accordance with the principles articulated in White v. Jones, [1995] A.C. 207 (H.L.), by which remedy, akin to that flowing from the application of Hedley principles, is accorded an intended beneficiary where solicitor, on taking instructions for a will, can reasonably foresee the deprivation of an intended legacy if due care is not taken. 5) The Court found that in addition to the duty owed to the defendant","[2] Garry Mayer by this action claims that the mutual fund ought never to have formed part of his father’s estate. Nordstrom had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of Mayer’s intent to benefit Garry Mayer was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation.

The defendant was not a chartered life underwriter and financial consultant who sold life and investment products through Canada Life Assurance Company and Dataplan Securities Ltd. The deceased was the author of his own misfortune in ignoring advice and where the only evidence of the advice is from the advisor, there is an evidential onus upon the professional to demonstrate that the caution or advice was in fact given and ought reasonably to have been understood by the client.

b_2002skqb72.txt,"Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278. He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time. The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies. He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit. The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time. Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans. The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans. At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001. HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines. Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a). The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees. The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs. The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay. Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month. The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.  3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance. The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2). A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald. It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. 4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due.

The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence.

The cerified cheque did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants had already received payment for their services.  2)In recognizing exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certification the commercial utility of certification at the request of the payee is maintained while providing recourse to a bank where a payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of a certified cheque.","The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of a certified cheque as payment did not satisfy just debt.

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There are exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certified cheques. In considering an application under Rule 173(a) the court may only look at the notice of motion, the attached statement of claims and any document which is referred to in the Statement of claim upon which the plaintiff must rely for the establishment of the claim. The court must assume that all the allegations in the plaintiff’s statement of claimed are true, and so assuming, determine if such allegations are sufficient to disclose a reasonable cause of actions, the bank may successfully defend an action by its customer/drawer for reimbursement. 2)The plaintiff had already deposited the replacement cheque when it was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. 3)The defendant had already received payment for their services. 4)The court found that in this case the irreversable nature and liability of the bank to the holders of a cheque, which it certified at the request of the drawer or holder had the advantage of bringing a certified aque squarely within the framework of the Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-4 and codified the consequences of certification. 5)The Court found that the commercial utility of certification at request of a payee is maintained while providing recourse to bank where payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of a 'certified cheque'. The Court must assume the principles are inapplicable when a certified or 'Countermand of Cheques' is involved.","[1] The defendants seek to set aside a default judgment entered by the plaintiff against them and have the plaintiff's claim struck out.

d_2006skqb35.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules.

Since the Statement of Claim has twice been amended I am satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. [26] It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage of the proceedings to conclude that it is plain and obvious pursuant to Rule 173(a) of The Queen’s Bench Rules that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against Dr. Graham. The result is that paras. 21, 31(f) and (g), 32 (i) and (j) and 33(e) and (f) will not be struck at this time. [32] To the extent that the defendant, Dr. Graham, has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, undertaking number 37 must be answered. An accounting of funds held in trust by the plaintiff, Mark Baert, for the plaintiff, Lisa Dawson, may also impact on the claim by him of loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for Lisa Dawson (para. 27(c) of the Amended Amended Statement of Claim). In the final analysis such an accounting may not provide any usable information, but at this stage of the proceedings is justified. An accounting by the defendant, Mark Baert, pursuant to undertaking number 52 must be provided.",0.32343234323432346,"FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.","The plaintiffs sought an order compelling the defendant to respond to written interrogatories and an order permitting further oral examination for discovery of the plaintiff on issues arising from his responses to the written questions.

Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the Statement of Claim has been amended, special circumstances exist permitting further examination. The Court embarks upon an assessment of the merits of the claim and the motives of the plaintiffs.

It was entitled to attempt to limit the liability of first defendants. 2)The plaintiffs were not entitled to punitive damages.","[4] SMI brought an application pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the former Queen’s Bench Rules to have the claim against it struck in its entirety. 7.1 From on or about May 18, 2011, continuing until the present, the second defendant and third defendants conspired and combined amongst themselves to defraud and to injure the plaintiffs in order to delay or defeat the plaintiffs’ obvious and substantial crop loss because of chemical spray drift. b) On November 30, 2012, the second defendant SMI caused to be disclosed to the plaintiffs two binders of documents thereby admitting relevancy and admissibility of those documents and waiving privilege, if any, in relation to those documents; [6] SMI has argued that Rule 7-9(3) includes implicitly the ability to file documentation referred to in the claim (McCreight v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 ONCA 483 (CanLII), 116 O.R. (3d) 429) where on an identical rule the Ontario Court of Appeal allowed that “...a statement of claim is deemed to include any documents incorporated by reference into the pleading and that form an integral part of the plaintiff’s claim. The plaintiffs make an application under Rule 3-72(1)(c)(ii) which replaces Rule 165 of the former Queen’s Bench Rules: 25 and 28: 25 ...A contract of insurance between an insurer and its insured is one of utmost good faith. There are no cases that suggest that a duty to act fairly and in good faith arises from the issuance of a policy where no claim is made against it. [16] In our adversarial system to impose a duty upon an insurer to act fairly and in good faith to its insured in defence of the claim, while at the same time to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiff in prosecution of the claim, is impossible. [17] SMI is obliged to defend the interests of the first defendants under the policy. An insurance contract may provide a duty to defend, but not a duty to indemnify. For the most part, the objections raised to the affidavit material filed are valid.",0.3929273084479371,"FIAT MILLS The real issue in this application is whether Saskatchewan Mutual Insurance Company (SMI) was in a special relationship of insurer with the plaintiffs that carried a duty of good faith and fair dealing. The plaintiffs are policy holders of the defendant SMI. This policy is not an issue in the action commenced by the plaintiffs and is not relied on for coverage in respect of the claim. SMI is the insurer for the defendants and is involved in this claim by virtue of policy of insurance with the defendants. The defendant farmers had insurance coverage for this type of loss and turned the claim over to SMI to be dealt with. There was no allegation of an increased loss as a result of this claim. HELD: The application for punitive damages was dismissed. 1)The court found that a breach of the contract of insurance between the insurer and the plaintiffs would create a conflict of interest which would require the insurer to breach the duties described above, placing the indemnity insurer in an impossible situation which would not advance the law or the public interest. 2)There was no evidence that the plaintiff's statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action. 3)The Court found that there was no duty to third party by an insurance company to deal with claims arising under one of the policies after their issuance.",0.4876957494407159

The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'. The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay. HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable. If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness. 3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise. The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness. 4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule. The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct. 5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing.","FIAT: An application for judicial review of a unanimous arbitration award by a three-person panel dated December 1, 1994 which reinstated the respondent as an employee of the applicant.

The period from August 18, 1993 to the date that this Award shall be treated as a suspension without pay for approximately 16 months. 2)The Board's interpretation of the mutual agreement with respect to clause 10 was correct. 3)The applicant took issue with the fact the Board refused to apply the doctrine of culminating incident and concluded that the August 14, 1993 incident amounted to a culminating incident. 4)The penalty imposed by the Board for taking into account the respondent's absence from work on August 14/93 together with his previous employment record, the appropriate penalty was not discharge. 5)The application was dismissed with one set of costs.","This is an application for judicial review of a

While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M.

Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time.

In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR). Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH). The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH. The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts. The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies. HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for. The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.  2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue. It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH. The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA). While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act. The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings. The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer. The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer. The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered. They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.","HELD: The application was granted.

The parties were not in dispute that CNH Canada and CNH Capital stand as successors to the respective contracting parties, and have assumed their respective rights and obligations relating to the TD priority agreements. The issues relate only to the interpretation of the respective priority agreements between TD and the CNH companies and to the corporate policy of CNH as to the return of direct ship parts. The contractual provisions clearly entitle the defendant to refuse to restock the inventory of a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers. The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and the credits financed by NHCC that Wheatland has not paid for in full. The defendant's claim is adjusted to $88,724.59. Notwithstanding the possibility of a contrary interpretation, it would have been logical for the agreement to have contained an explicit provision that parts and supplies are not 'Goods' or 'inventory' for the purposes of the Agreement. CNH is acting on behalf of all creditors to determine priority between competing claimants. That is not the same as CNH seeking to change the priorities as between the respective claimants. Parts and service manuals returned by the Receiver to CNH are unique or 'one-off' items CNH contends that the word'specially' as used in s.50(14) of the Agricultural Implements Act refers to any new and used Goods effective upon NHCC having been paid by the dealer in full for them. In this case, the defendant is in default in its obligations to TD. The defendants object to the propriety of a court-appointed receiver taking the side of a competing creditor in a priority dispute amongst creditors. In the context in which the employment of the direct ship inventory model was supposedly for the mutual benefit of the parties, the agreement was not the basis for the parties' claims.","On May 11, 2006, when Wheatland owed TD approximately $470,000, TD demanded payment and gave notice pursuant to s. 244 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.

The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA). While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act. The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings. The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer. The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer. The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered. They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.","HELD: The court found that the goods/parts issue was the cornerstone of the priority agreement and that the agreements provided by the parties were the essential intent of the contracting parties and the impact of the agreement. The parties were not in dispute that CNH Canada and CNH Capital stand as successors to the respective contracting parties, and have assumed their respective rights and obligations relating to the TD priority agreements. The issues relate only to the interpretation of the respective priority agreements between TD and the CNH companies and to the corporate policy of CNH as to the return of direct ship parts. The contractual provisions clearly entitle the defendant to refuse to restock the inventory of a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers. The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and the credits financed by NHCC that Wheatland has not paid for in full. The defendant's claim is adjusted to $88,724.59. Notwithstanding the possibility of a contrary interpretation, it would have been logical for the agreement to have contained an explicit provision that parts and supplies are not 'Goods' or 'inventory' for the purposes of the Agreement. CNH is acting on behalf of all creditors to determine priority between competing claimants. That is not the same as CNH seeking to change the priorities as between the respective claimants. Parts and service manuals returned by the Receiver to CNH are unique or 'one-off' items CNH contends that the word'specially' as used in s.50(14) of the Agricultural Implements Act refers to any new and used Goods effective upon NHCC having been paid by the dealer in full for them. In this case, the defendant is in default in its obligations to TD. The defendants object to the propriety of a court-appointed receiver taking the side of a competing creditor in a priority dispute amongst creditors. In the context in which the employment of the direct ship inventory model was supposedly for the mutual benefit of the parties, the agreement was not the basis for the parties' claims.","On May 11, 2006, when Wheatland owed TD approximately $470,000, TD demanded payment and gave notice pursuant to s. 244 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B‑3, of its intention to enforce its security. [20] Notwithstanding the possibility of a contrary interpretation, in accordance with the submission on behalf of CNH on this application, it seems clear that objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the NHCC security would have priority over the TD security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by New Holland but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. PwC is entitled to recover from CNH Canada and CNH Capital the full balances of the credit accounts totalling $235,336.96. Indeed, they were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH Canada to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer (ss. 50(22)).

The children's mother was deceased and their father indicated that he was unable to meet his children's needs. The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children. They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated. The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access. The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister. HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b). The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change. The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister. The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father.","The agency initially applied for a long term order under s.37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act.

HELD: The agency applied to have each child in need of protection pursuant to s37 of The Act, and in the MATTER of an application to have them placed in the custody of the person of sufficient interest, which effectively means they are not in a position, due to his circumstances, to offer a stable and nurturing environment, certainly not at this time.

On the evidence before me, I find that each child is in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Act.

2_2010skqb444.txt,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence. On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marihuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He applied for an order excluding evidence of cocaine found in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were violated. This decision follows voir dire held to determine the admissibility of the evidence. HELD: The evidence must be excluded. 1) The accused's right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure under the Charter was infringed when he was held at the roadside and 'booked in' before being given access to counsel.  2) The evidence was excluded because the accused had not matched the VIN number on the dash and registration on the door to the door. 3) There was no evidence to suggest that the accused was carrying contraband.  4) The search of the motor home was done without warrant. Warrantless searches are presumptively unreasonable and contrary to the Charter. It is for the Crown to establish, on balance of probabilities, that the search was lawful and that the manner in which it was carried out was reasonable.","[1] The accused is charged with possession of cocaine and marihuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19 as am. He applies for an order excluding evidence of cocaine and marihuana found concealed in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, (the “Charter”) were violated. THE FACTS [2] On the afternoon of June 13, 2007, the accused was driving a motor home on the TransCanada highway near Caronport, Saskatchewan when he was stopped by RCMP Cst. Ian Warner. ISSUES [51] The accused submits that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed. It also satisfies me that neither Cst. Wilson nor any of the other police officers had reasonable suspicion that the motor home being driven by the accused was stolen much less that it was carrying drugs. All of this supports an inference that the detention and arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property was a pretext to justify a search of the vehicle for illegal drugs. In conducting that search police officers were acting on no more than a hunch based on intuition. [69] I find that the search of the motor home incidental to the accused’s arrest for possession of stolen property was an intrusion into his right to be secure from unreasonable search or seizure.
 [80] I have already found that Cst. Wilson, who made the decision to arrest the accused, did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home was stolen. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. [82] I have earlier determined that the observations made by the police officers which caused them to reasonably suspect the accused was hauling contraband in his motor home were a product of their search incidental to his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. Thus, he was not given an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. Thus, although the accused’s s. 10(b) right was breached, there was no causal connection between the breach and the discovery of the drugs. [92] Here, the initial stop of the motor home was justified, but the ensuing s. 8 and s. 9 breaches (i.e. the search of the motor home incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property), were very serious. [93] While I do not believe Cst. Wilson intended to breach the Charter from the outset, I find that his actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. [99] I conclude that the deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the unconstitutional detention and arrest of the accused and consequent search was therefore a significant, but not egregious, intrusion on his Charter protected interests. [110] Accordingly, I find that admitting the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute and that the standards is paramount. For that reason, I find the evidence seized from the motor home on June 13, 2007 must be excluded.",0.4340659340659341,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles.

HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence. On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He applied for an order excluding evidence of marijuana found in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were violated. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The evidence was excluded. 1) The accused's right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure under the Charter was infringed when he was held at the roadside and 'booked in' before being given access to counsel. 2) The Court found that the accused's claim to privacy in the context of his possession of stolen property was not infringed. The Court held that there was no breach of the accused’s right to privacy under s. 8 or s. 10 of The Charter.  3) There was no reasonable expectation of privacy at the time the accused was arrested. The accused had not raised this issue with the Court. 4) The court reviewed the circumstances of the arrest and found that there were no unreasonable search and seizure provisions in the Charter.","[1] The accused is charged with possession of cocaine and marihuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19 as am. He applies for an order excluding evidence of cocaine and marihuana found concealed in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, (the “Charter”) were violated. THE FACTS [2] On the afternoon of June 13, 2007, the accused was driving a motor home on the TransCanada highway near Caronport, Saskatchewan when he was stopped by RCMP Cst. Ian Warner. ISSUES [51] The accused submits that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed. It also satisfies me that neither Cst. Wilson nor any of the other police officers had reasonable suspicion that the motor home being driven by the accused was stolen much less that it was carrying drugs. All of this supports an inference that the detention and arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property was a pretext to justify a search of the vehicle for illegal drugs. In conducting that search police officers were acting on no more than a hunch based on intuition. [69] I find that the search of the motor home incidental to the accused’s arrest for possession of stolen property was an intrusion into his right to be secure from unreasonable search or seizure.
 [80] I have already found that Cst. Wilson, who made the decision to arrest the accused, did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home was stolen. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. [82] I have earlier determined that the observations made by the police officers which caused them to reasonably suspect the accused was hauling contraband in his motor home were a product of their search incidental to his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. Thus, he was not given an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. Thus, although the accused’s s. 10(b) right was breached, there was no causal connection between the breach and the discovery of the drugs. [92] Here, the initial stop of the motor home was justified, but the ensuing s. 8 and s. 9 breaches (i.e. the search of the motor home incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property), were very serious. [93] While I do not believe Cst. Wilson intended to breach the Charter from the outset, I find that his actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. [99] I conclude that the deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the unconstitutional detention and arrest of the accused and consequent search was therefore a significant, but not egregious, intrusion on his Charter protected interests. [110] Accordingly, I find that admitting the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute and that the standards is paramount. For that reason, I find the evidence seized from the motor home on June 13, 2007 must be excluded.",0.43681318681318676,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer.

2008skqb287.txt,"The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case. The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.","The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned 18 years.

However, assuming it is in the best interests of the children, the Minister shall proceed to some unsupervised access at an appropriate time in the future.",0.5630252100840336,"The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case. The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.","The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the Minister's care until each child turned 18 years.

As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s.89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act. The driving occurred when the accused was involved in a motor vehicle accident and engaged in other alleged misconduct, including driving without due care and consideration for others, and failing to identify himself to the other driver before departing from the scene. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The evidence was not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification. The accused's liberty was jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. The Court reviewed the decision of R. v. Kraftchick (2006), 37 M.V.R. (5th) 228, (Sask. Prov. Ct.) (CanLII). The Court applied the principles of McKenzie supra, while not necessarily believing the evidence, that there is a presumption against strict liability offences, and in favour of some element of mens rea or criminal intent that must be established by the Crown.","[1] The accused is charged that he did, on or about February 17, 2006, at Saskatoon, drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then. ANALYSIS Should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence?

[10] During argument, I had suggested to counsel that the driving while disqualified matter herein should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities.

As such the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.",0.5426829268292682,"The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then. The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification? HELD: The accused is not guilty. 1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2) The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time. Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later. At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief. Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope.

The deceased's will was submitted to probate in 1997 and the appellant made a number of specific bequests, including a bequest of $50,000 to her niece, Merilyn Hendry, and bequest to the Zion Lutheran Church. As of the date of this appeal, no part of those funds had been returned. The appellant appealed. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)The grounds of appeal are without merit, indeed, without any modicum of merit. The appeal was brought for the sole purpose of delaying the legatees from pursuing their legitimate rights. As such, this proceeding is an abuse of the appeal process. 2)Solicitor and client costs are awarded in this jurisdiction in rare and exceptional circumstances (Brown v. Metropolitan Authority et al (1996), 150 N.S.R. (2d) 43 (C.A.). 3)The appellant's actions amounted to a serious dereliction of duty which we would class as unconscionable.

The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32.

The amount of damages as to this aspect of the defendant Lilia's claim is adjourned to a date to be determined. It may be that there are no damages incurred by the defendant if she now qualifies for payment from Service Canada. 2) Lilia claims back $2,400.00 which was paid to the defendant in the amount of $500 per month and then 7 days later the first payment would be taken out. There was no loan documentation prepared and/or signed, which would have affected the fact that once she was dismissed by the plaintiff, the plaintiff had an obligation to record accurate working hours in the record of her employment and housing.

She also claims that she was awarded $960.00 being deductions from her December cheque. 4) As there was no evidence to support the claim that Lilia received the $3,500.00 cheque, there is no basis to withhold the $960 from Christos on his last cheque and there if no evidence was put forward by Lilia that supports that claim. The balance of probabilities are not satisfied. 5) The court found that there were no costs awarded to Lilia as a result of her failure to obtain the payments that she had lost.  6) The Court was not satisfied that there was a loan of $1 million.

4_2004skqb280.txt,"This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a). The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","FIAT: This is an application pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act (ISLA) for a declaration of paternity and child support. The parties never lived together but had an intimate relationship which resulted in the birth of a child. Given his health, his education, experience and physical limitations, the parties' financial situation do not support the imputation of income. HELD: 1) Section expenses are often referred to as 'add ons' to Table support. These expenses cover items that are not normally covered in regular child support orders. Some s. expenses such as those relating to child care costs may entitle the court to impute income. 2) The parties' standard of living is below that of the respondent due to the fact she has four dependent children and a very high debt load. The onus will be on the applicant to establish that any continued unemployment is unintentional or, if intentional, that it is reasonable in the circumstances. The applicant must lead cogent evidence to establish why the table amount would cause undue hardship. The evidence in this case does not support finding of intentional unemployment. The respondent has been actively working towards obtaining a position with the provincial government. He has been unemployed since May 2003 and has been working on proposals for the province. His current income is below the amount normally required by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The court cannot be excused from his child support obligations in furtherance of unrealistic or unproductive career aspirations. 3) The evidence establishes that the applicant has the legal responsibility for another child or children and the parties’ financial situations do not warrant such a finding. The Court must establish that the respondent has the ability to seek employment in case where parent is healthy and there is no reason why the parent cannot work.","[1] This is an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act, S.S. 2002, c.

The accident was substantially based on injuries he received in the accident and more specifically, on the treatment provided to him by the other respondent at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital. The plaintiff's wife died shortly after the plaintiff's operation to insert pressure clamps in the presence of an undetected disk hernia. Jurisdiction: the evidence will not be so complex and scientific that the applicant's substantive right to a trial by jury should be denied. The evidence will be limited in time and in the most relevant anatomical area (the thoracic vertebrae region of the spinal column). The medical experts will mainly focus on the interventions of the medical personnel at the medical centres at Neil's Harbour, Sydney and Halifax. However, the principal subject matter will be the medical condition of the plaintiff by virtue of her cross-claim against the plaintiff and her use of radiological investigation to determine if there was disk herniation or impingement into the spinal canal.","[2] Doctor Malik now applies, pursuant to s. 34 (a)(ii) of the Judicature Act R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 240, to set aside the Jury Notice filed by the applicants.

I conclude that the evidence will not be so complex and scientific that the applicant’s substantive right to a trial by jury should be denied.

Dismissing the appeal, that the insurer of a subcontractor on a construction project was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss by the insurer of the principle contractor where the risk was allocated by the contract documents to the principle contractor and not the subcontractor.","This was an appeal from a decision declaring that the respondent Guardian was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss insured against by the appellant Hartford. The Province had entered into a contract with Fraser-Brace for the construction of a hospital. The hospital was never at risk for fire loss and the named insured was Delta with loss, if any, payable to the Province. Hartford sought contribution from Delta's insurer, Guardian. Without acknowledging liability, the insurer paid some $400,000 to Hartford to facilitate progress payments to Delta. The respondent sued to recover its money with interest from Hartford on the basis that the Guardian policy provided that the building was never required to carry builder's risk insurance. The learned trial judge found the building never at the insured's risk; that the policy was void and that Guardian wasn't liable. Hartford ordered the respondent to repay the advances with compound interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)There was no evidence nor even suggestion that Delta caused the fire. Guardian had no obligation to Delta to pay the fire as Delta, under its subcontract with Fraser Brace, was never the risk for the fire loss. As Delta did not cause the fire, it had no liability to the province or Fraser- Brace for causing it fire. 2)The appellant had no contractual relationship with Guardian and the Province, nor between Guardian and Hartford which could give rise to any obligation on Guardian's part to contribute towards the fire losses suffered by the Province and insured by Hartford. 3)The appeal on the main issue ought to be dismissed. There is no evidence and no evidence of the fire causing the fire and the obligation to insure the risk had been allocated to Fraser‑Brace by the contract with the Province for the Fire loss. Delta was not at risk of the loss of the Province's property as there was no allocation of fire risk to Delta by contract documents. In this case it never did.","THE COURT: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent to be taxed per reasons for judgment of Hallett, J.A.; Matthews and Freeman, JJ.A. concurring.

The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance. The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC. He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine.

The defendant was noted for default on this claim and the damages were assessed at $37,717.35, $10,000 of which were punitive. The plaintiff submits that s.102 of the Act should not deprive a citizen of the right to sue a defendant for injuries caused by assault, battery, fraud, or similar torts. HELD: The plaintiff has no cause for action by virtue of her injuries having been caused by an automobile. The plaintiff was precluded by s.102 of the Act from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. Although s.102 of the Act prohibits certain types of law suits, the act provides victims with compensation for injury. No order as to costs.","The plaintiff had applied for an order pursuant to s.55 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act requiring Saskatchewan Government Insurance to pay to the plaintiff the amount awarded to her in a 1998 judgment. The plaintiff had alleged that the defendant, as pedestrian, had pinned her between an automobile and a stationary motor vehicle, thereby causing personal injury to her. HELD: There was a declaration that the plaintiff was precluded, by s.102 of the Act, from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. 1)The Court of Appeal could not reach that conclusion and stated that the limitation period in s. 143(1)(a) of The Vehicles Act, 1983 applied. 2)The plaintiff was awarded damages in the total amount of $37,717.35, which included punitive damages of $10,000. 3)There was no order as to costs.","[1] The plaintiff has applied for an order, pursuant to s. 55 of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. A-35 (the “Act”), requiring Saskatchewan Government Insurance (“SGI”) to pay to the plaintiff the amount awarded to the plaintiff in a judgment dated October 29, 1998. [2] The defendant, on the other hand, has applied for an order setting aside the judgment and striking out the claim of the plaintiff. [11] The plaintiff has further submitted that s. 102 cannot have been intended to deprive a citizen of the right to sue a defendant for injuries caused by assault, battery, intentional infliction of mental suffering, fraud, deceit and fraudulent misrepresentation. [13] That statement may be accurate, but it overlooks the fact that, although s. 102 of the Act prohibits certain types of law suits, it does not result in the victim not being compensated for personal injuries incurred as a result of an automobile. [19] Consequently, there must be a declaration that the plaintiff was precluded, by s. 102 of the Act, from commencing a valid legal action, with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity.",0.5923753665689151,"The plaintiff applied for an order pursuant to s. 55 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act requiring Saskatchewan Government Insurance to pay to the plaintiff the amount awarded to her in a 1998 judgment.

3_2001skqb332.txt,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act. Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.","The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-15. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge found no error in the trial judge's finding that the returns purportedly filed were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is of no moment. The appellants had failed to rectify the omission after such reasonable opportunities. The court placed much emphasis on the discretionary powers of the Minister and the fact that he was the sole director of the corporation. The defect in the summons did not destroy the jurisdiction of the trial court.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.",The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act for failing to file goods and services tax returns. The notice purported to be signed by someone specifically designated by the Minister pursuant to the regulations. HELD: The appeal was refused. 1)The Court lacked jurisdiction to proceed with the matter by reason of alleged defects in the summons or alternatively the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing. 2)There was no evidence to justify the learned Provincial Court judge's finding that returns were not filed. The demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by some person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf.  3)The notice simply required a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is of no moment. 4)The Act does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s. 21 of the Code. The question raised is not arguable merit nor matter of sufficient importance to warrant review by this Court.,"[1] The appellants appeal their convictions for the following two offences under the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-15, as am. (the ""Act""): Count #1 THAT GUNNER INDUSTRIES LTD. of 682 Adams Street, Regina, Saskatchewan and Clint Kimery of 682 Adams Street, Regina, Saskatchewan, on or about the 16th day of November, A.D. 1999, at Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, did, while operating as Goods and Services Tax Registrant, and while subject to the provisions of the Excise Tax Act, unlawfully fail to file Goods and Services Tax Returns as required by section 282 thereof, for the return for the period January 1, 1999 to March 31, 1999; thereby committing an offence contrary to section 326 of the Excise Tax Act. Count #2 THAT GUNNER INDUSTRIES LTD. of 682 Adams Street, Regina, Saskatchewan and Clint Kimery of 682 Adams Street, Regina, Saskatchewan, on or about the 16th day of November, A.D. 1999, at Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, did, while operating as Goods and Services Tax Registrant, and while subject to the provisions of the Excise Tax Act, unlawfully fail to file Goods and Services Tax Returns as required by section 282 thereof, for the return for the period April 1, 1999 to June 30, 1999; thereby committing an offence contrary to section 326 of the Excise Tax Act. [3] The appellants raised a number of grounds for the appeal which may be summarized as follows: There was no evidence to justify the learned Provincial Court judge\'s finding that returns were not filed; That there was unreasonable delay which compromised the appellants\' right to a fair trial; That the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by some person authorized to sign on the Minister\'s behalf. [12] I agree with Mr. McBride that s. 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s. 21 of the Criminal Code. [14] There was evidence to support the trial judge's finding that Kimery was guilty under s. 330. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents which were filed. I agree with the trial judge that the returns purportedly filed were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. [18] In short, there was evidence to support the finding by the trial judge that the appellants\' failed to file returns as required by s. 326. [19] The argument that the appellants were denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by s. 11(b) of the Charter is without merit. Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. [22] Once charges were laid the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable period of time. In my opinion, the fact that the letter of requirement was signed with the handwritten words of Mr. Potven using the name ""R. J. MacIssac"" over the typed or printed designation of ""Director-Taxation"" is sufficient to bring the document within the type described in sec. 244(13). For these reasons, the application is refused. The execution and serving of such a demand is purely an administrative act. It does not require the exercise of a Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of his or her rights by restricting any right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is of no moment.

4_2011skpc13.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care or control. The Court dismissed the charge of care or control over .08 after a non-suit application. During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying. During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech. In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.  The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence. HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document. The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out. While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence. This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1).","The accused applied to the Court pursuant to s. 24(1) and 24(2) of the Charter for remedies, which include a stay of the impaired driving charge, an order for a mistrial on that count, a direction that Mr. Moore be allowed to further cross-examine Crown witnesses and an order excluding evidence. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence as a result of a lack of full disclosure. HELD: The accused's rights were infringed. 1)The officer inadvertently failed to copy the full extent of the Operational Chechleets, and the incomplete copy went to both the defence lawyer and the Crown prosecutor. That said, the prosecutor referred to the original Checksheet during Cst. Pshyk's re-direct testimony and introduced the Checksheet into evidence without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what he had in his file and what had been disclosed to the defence. 2)The Court found that bad faith was the cause of the lack of disclosure on what was a critical point in this case and the time at which this failure was discovered, rendered this trial to be unfair in a way that was not satisfied can be remedied through an adjournment and disclosure order.","[1] Mr. Charron is charged with operating or with being in the care or control of a vehicle while impaired by alcohol on August 25, 2009, at Rocanville.

In making this application, the defence asserts a breach of Mr. Charron’s right to make full answer and defence under s. 7 of the Charter as a result of a lack of full disclosure.

Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act. The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested. The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act.

Child support obligations take precedence over spousAL support.  6) The court has authority to order an interim order.","[1] The wife applies for interim spousal support and an order providing her with an interim distribution of property in the amount of $25,000. [5] The wife seeks an order in the amount of $2,000 per month to equalize the gross incomes of the parties. Where there is a significant disparity in the incomes of each of the former spouses in the immediate post‑separation period, and such economic disparity defines a corresponding disparity in the affordability of lifestyles of the former spouses, spousal support is the appropriate mechanism to diminish those disparities. In addition, there is no dispute that there is a significant disparity in incomes and lifestyles between the spouses. [11] Having considered all of these matters, I direct that the husband pay to the wife the sum of $500 per month in interim spousal support commencing on June 1, 2016 and continuing on the first of each month until further agreement or court order. [18] This is not a situation where the net assets far exceed the amount of the distribution claimed. The wife’s application for an interim distribution is dismissed.",0.5463743676222598,"FIAT: The wife applied for interim spousal support and an order providing her with an interim distribution of property in the amount of $25,000. HELD: The court found that the wife had failed to demonstrate a need for support at this time. The court ordered that the husband pay the wife $500 per month in interim support commencing June 1, 2016 and continuing on the first of each month until further agreement or court order. This amount shall be tax deductible to the husband and taxable to the wife. Interim Distribution of Property [1] The wife sought an order to equalize the gross incomes of the parties. She argued that the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines should not apply in this situation. The husband did not take issue with the wife's entitlement to interim support but states that she has failed to show a need to pay. The Court found that although the net assets for distribution were acquired during the marriage, they were not sufficient to provide the husband with adequate support to meet the immediate needs of the former spouses. The wife was also seeking an order for the husband to take out a loan to facilitate the payment of the interim distribution.",0.3945578231292517

Allowing the appeal, that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity. The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward. The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.","This was an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his estranged wife. The evidence indicated that the respondent had come to visit his wife. He complained of being tired and suffering from insomnia. She gave him a sleeping pill and told him that he should not consume alcohol. The respondent left but returned about 4:00 p.m. and was in possession of a quart of whiskey. He left shortly thereafter taking the whiskey with him. At approximately 2:00 a.m., he returned to the wife's residence.

8_2010skca149.txt,"The father appealed from the decision of the Chamber's judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment. The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below. The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant. For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances. No error was made on this issue. The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz. The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting. She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests. There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them.

HELD: The appeal of the father is dismissed. 1) The evidence regarding the children's wishes was limited and inconclusive. The Chambers judge was entitled not only to take into account the change in the status quo, but was required to do so as part of her broader consideration of the children’s needs and needs. The threshold condition of material change in circumstance satisfied, the court should consider the matter afresh without defaulting to the existing arrangement. 2) Given the state of the evidence, it was open to the judge to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the child. She observed that given their ages and maturity levels, their wishes would not normally be taken into account in a structuring parenting arrangement.

A party is required to divulge the facts that it has now or admit that it has none if such is the case. The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that he can be further examined on the responses. If the position of the defendant as set forth in those responses changes as a result of after acquired information, the defendant shall so inform the plaintiff by way of supplemental responses within 90 days following the completion of the defendant's examinations for discovery of the third parties. If it is necessary for the plaintiff to further examine for discovery on the defendant's responses or supplemental responses, the defendant's proper officer shall attend such examination for discovery. 2) The material filed satisfies the Court that PSAC documents relating to the PST issue are at least broadly relevant to the issues and that BJ Services likely has the power to obtain and produce them. The fact that BJ Services may intend to claim a litigation privilege over the documents, or that PSAC may not produce them, does not relieve BJ Services of the obligation to disclose their existence.

7_2001canlii346.txt,"The Crown withdrew one count at the opening of the trial and the accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration in excess of .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician. HELD: The accused was found guilty. There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying. The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient. His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples. The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient. 3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required. 4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay. The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called as witnesses the boyfriend of the accused's sister-in-law and the doctor who was working with the accused at the time of the accident. HELD: The Crown established beyond a reasonable doubt that the blood was either taken personally by the accused or was taken by a technician under his supervision. The Court accepted the evidence of the doctor that the samples were taken from the accused while at the Victoria Hospital, Prince Albert. The court found that the accused had reasonable and probable grounds to make the demand, based on the doctor's opinion that the taking of the blood would not endanger his life or health. The officer testified that he relied on police officers and trusted them. The accused's memory of events was significantly affected by his alcohol consumption on the night in question but he went on to say that he could not be 100% sure that he had taken the blood himself.","24. A number of issues were raised in submissions of counsel at trial:
(1) whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the demand?


(2) whether the demand met the requirements of (I) the sample being taken by a medical practitioner or under the supervision of a medical practitioner; (II) whether the officer had actually obtained information from the physician so that he could be confident and advise the accused that the taking of the blood sample would not endanger the life of the accused?
3. whether the accused gave a valid consent?
4. whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable?
5. whether the Crown can rely on the Certificate of Qualified Medical Practitioner (P-5) where on the evidence as a whole there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician in the taking of the sample? 25. I have found that the officer had the following grounds when he made the demand: (1) the accused was in the driver\'s compartment of the vehicle; (2) odour of alcohol from the vehicle and subsequently confirmed to be coming from the accused\'s breath; (3) open 1/16 full OV bottle of beer in the vehicle; and (4) the nature of the accident. upon this review of the case law, I conclude that the facts that were in the mind of the officer at the time he decided to make the demand did amount to reasonable and probable grounds for his doing so. As set out in my findings of fact, I am satisfied that, although the Crown has not proved whether the doctor or a technician actually took the blood sample, there is no other logical conclusion on the facts than that either the doctor took the samples himself or the technician took them under the supervision of the doctor. I am satisfied that the doctor would have acted to prevent any occurrence that would have endangered the life or health of his patient. I conclude that the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all of the matters that could have been proved by the certificate, P-5, if it could have been relied upon. 36. Having found that the officer has reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of the accused\'s blood pursuant to the requirements of Sections 254 and 258 of the Criminal Code, the accused\'s consent was not required. Given the condition of the accused and his need for care and, given the limitations on the opportunities to the officer to observe the accused to determine if he had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand, there is no question in my mind that the officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any unnecessary delay. Given these facts, I conclude - relying on the approach taken in R.v. Van Der Veen, (1988), 1988 ABCA 277 (CanLII), 44 C.C.C. (3d) 38 (Alberta Court of Appeal), and, R.v. Phillips, (1988), 1988 CanLII 198 (ON CA), 42 C.C.C. (3d) 150 (Ont. Court of Appeal) - the blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all of the circumstances. 39. There is no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analyst. Therefore, it establishes that the accused\'s blood alcohol level at the time of driving was 159 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. 40. On review of the evidence as a whole I have no reasonable doubt that the Crown has established all of the elements of the offence, I find the accused guilty as charged.",0.3711083437110834,"The Crown withdrew one count at the opening of the trial and the accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration in excess of .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician.

There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying.

The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.","The accused stands charged that he consumed alcohol in such quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, have the care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called as witnesses the boyfriend of the accused's sister-in-law, Dawn Anderson, the officer's wife and the doctor's brother. The officer testified that he asked the boyfriend to take the samples and that the doctor advised him that there could be an open bottle of beer in the vehicle.

The accused would have acted to prevent any occurrence that would have endangered the life or health of his patient. 1) The facts were in the mind of the officer at the time he decided to make the demand did amount to reasonable and probable grounds for his doing so. The evidence at trial disclosed that the medical practitioner had no recollection of having the doctor complete the wrong form (P-2). The doctor clearly would not have done so if he were of the opinion that the taking of the blood samples for law enforcement purposes would not endanger his life or that his testimony was in relation to a visit by the officer to his home and not at his home. 2) There was no evidence that the officer, who was present when the blood sample was taken, the doctor or technician took care of the samples from the accused. The medical practitioner testified that if he said it was okay to take, he would have advised him to do so. 3) The officer's testimony that he did not recall the doctor signing the second certificate to him at the hospital was not supported by the evidence as to whether the officer had communicated his request of permission from the doctor to make a demand in more explicit language in respect to the question of 'Red, Bloodshot Eyes or Watery Eyes'. The officer was advised that if the officer said so, that he would advise the doctor that he should take the sample himself.","24. A number of issues were raised in submissions of counsel at trial:
(1) whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the demand?


(2) whether the demand met the requirements of (I) the sample being taken by a medical practitioner or under the supervision of a medical practitioner; (II) whether the officer had actually obtained information from the physician so that he could be confident and advise the accused that the taking of the blood sample would not endanger the life of the accused?

[62] For the foregoing reasons, the Certificate of Analyses will be admitted into evidence on the trial proper.",0.6084337349397589,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused attempted unsuccessfully to reach three different lawyers but ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. HELD: The accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights were not infringed. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1) Charter breaches were moderately serious. The officer's failure to make the demand 11 minutes earlier than he did raised the issue of reasonable delay. 2) The accused was arbitrarily detained for 11 minutes and a sample of his breath was obtained. However, the officer appeared to have acted in good faith. He should have informed the accused why he was placed in the police vehicle and ought to have made the demand as soon as he formed the reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. 3) The Certificate ofalyses was admitted into evidence. 4) It is my view that Charter breaches are moderately serious and the accused's Charter rights are not infringered. 5) There is little in the accused’s testimony upon which to determine the impact of the detention upon him. He testified that he was unaware of his right to counsel and the officer did not take any steps to provide him with their after-hours contact numbers or obtain their home numbers. 6) The Court found the accused was not given an opportunity to exercise his Charter rights. 7) It was also found that the certificate of analysis would not be excluded under s. 24(2). 8) The court found there was a range in the potential impact upon an accused, fromfleeting and technical to profoundly invasive. The more serious the effect of the breaches, the greater the risk that the admission of a breath sample would bring to account the rights obtained by the accused.",0.5732484076433122

b_2011skpc19.txt,"The accused was a passenger in a van where the driver was stunting on the complainant's street. The complainant was an off duty police officer who left his home and knocked on the passenger window. The accused exited the van and assaulted the complainant resulting in the complainant receiving a broken nose and ankle. The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer. The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer. 1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed. Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.  2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other. The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code.

MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent.

The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process. They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money.

HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed. 1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.  'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act. The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications. They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses. The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act. That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction. The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act. The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed. They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. 2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case. There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions.

The Court found that this action and similar proceedings commenced in other jurisdictions in Canada in respect of similar multi-jurisdictional class action claims were an abuse of the court process and that the court had the statutory and inherent jurisdiction to order the action stayed.

The plaintiff claimed the creditor wrongfully converted monies after a full and final settlement of his account for a lesser sum ($2,000 on a $15,600 account). He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'. The plaintiff assigned his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application to his outstanding account in May 2001. In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle. An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died. The defendant says it was subsequently induced to settle the debt for a lesser sum by the plaintiff's false representation that SGI was suing him for between $200,000 and $300,000; that he would be found liable and would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy, making the account uncollectible. SGI initiated proceedings against the plaintiff in May 2002 claiming $17,660. The defendant contended that, if there was an accord and satisfaction, it was avoided due to mistake of fact or misrepresentation. HELD: The application for summary judgment was dismissed.

In May, 2001 the plaintiff assigned to the defendant his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application on his outstanding account.

Louisville Sales Service Inc. et al. (1999), 1999 SKQB 276 (CanLII), 190 Sask. R. 73 (Q.B.) does not assist the plaintiff. In that case, Laing J. said at para. 4:...the test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavit material filed but rather, whether despite the contradictory evidence, the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would not otherwise be unjust to do so. 2)The plaintiff owed the defendant monies for chemicals and fertilizer. In May, 2001 the plaintiff assigned to the defendant his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application on his outstanding account. Subsequent to this, the parties agreed to settle the debt for a lesser sum. The defendant says it was induced to settle by the plaintiff's false representation that: 1. Saskatchewan Government Insurance was suing him for between $250,000 and $300,000; 2. That the plaintiff would be found liable; and 3. That plaintiff would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy rendering the defendant’s account uncollectible.  4)SGI had no money and with the impending action by SGI against him for the recovery of damages due to his unlicensed vehicle being involved in a fatal accident, he was definitely being sued. SGI advised the plaintiff he would be personally responsible for all damages as the owner of an uninsured vehicle if there was no law suit. The statement of fact honestly held by person qualified to hold such an opinion cannot constitute an innocent misrepresentation founding an action for rescission.",0.6091370558375635

Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a). 2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations. The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable.

It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 487.05 of the Criminal Code for DNA Warrants to obtain blood samples from the male, the female and the child. The Informations in Support, each essentially identical, have been sworn by an RCMP officer. Each alleges that a middle-aged man and his 19-year old daughter have committed incest, contrary to ss. 155 of the Code, and that child, now months old, has been born as result of the incestuous relationship. The applications before the Court are for DNA warrant application with respect to the baby, at least until DNA analysis was carried out on blood or other bodily substances of the alleged father and the alleged mother. The baby is obviously not in any position to give an informed consent, instruct counsel or otherwise avail itself of the information required to be provided by the informant. The basis on which the officer has learned this, and from whom, is not stated. The maiden name of the 19 year old woman, as set out on the baby's Registration of Live Birth, is different than the surname of the natural mother. There is no other bodily substance in the possession or control of the Crown which relates to the alleged incest. While it is literally true that the natural Mother's blood sample has been obtained from 'within' her body, it is my view that it cannot reasonably be argued that this blood sample is 'associated with' the commission of an offence. While there are numerous definitions of the words “associate” and “associated with”, there is no indication as to the source of the blood sample, which is based on a two-month relationship at the time the child was allegedly conceived. There was nothing from the biological mother positively stating that no other person could be the father of this child. Such statement should ordinarily be included; this is especially the case when the relationship is shortlived. While the Informations attach copy of the Registration of live Birth obtained by the RCMP from Vital Statistics regarding the month old baby, there was no similar registration of live birth respecting his 19 year-old mother, notwithstanding that it appears she was born in Saskatchewan and the document should be as readily available as was that of the baby.

In this respect, we find that the Employer violated the collective agreement, and we therefore uphold the grievance in part.

The applicant had received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Regina in 2004 and was involved in the University's Board of Governors decision to withdraw an invitation to the applicant to be the keynote speaker at the National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding which was held in mid-March 2005. At the time, the applicant was employed by the Federation as Director of Higher Learning and Research.

Appellant applied for the return of the property under Rules 48.06 and Rule 48.08. Its application was dismissed and the appellant appealed that order. Appeal dismissed. The affidavit material filed by the appellant in support of its application was so defective as to be not admissible.

The court found that the prothónotary had erred in striking the appellant's affidavit from the record and in permitting reference to the appellant’s affidavit, which had been filed in the Supreme Court pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 48.01. It was from that dismissal that the appellant appeals.","THE COURT: Appeal dismissed per reasons for judgment of Bateman, J.A.; Glube, C.J.N.S. and Freeman, J.A. concurring. [4] ABS applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 48.06 and 48.08, for interlocutory relief from the recovery order and for security for costs. It is from that dismissal that ABS appeals.

The prime procedural value is that ""the affidavit is central to his conclusions and its admissibility, in its entirety, is fully argued"". 3) In this case, ABS applied pursuant to the Civil Procedure Rules 48.06 and 48.08, for inter-locutory relief from the recovery order and for security.",0.48437500000000006
d_2013skqb59.txt,"The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant. She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse. The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year. The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail. The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children.

The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this year and perhaps beyond. HELD: The court ordered that the children have telephone access to their father every three weeks, as may be arranged, until he is released from custody. There is nothing suggesting the two boys have anything other than a close and loving relationship with the father. While the father has been in jail since September 2012, first on remand, then as serving prisoner, he has not been seen by the children for the past few months. This is not an exceptional case.

The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial. The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants. Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment.

c_2009nssc180.txt,"At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007). Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009. The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years. The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines. She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it. The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands. Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward. The father's hardship arguments rejected. He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income. The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient. Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied. The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses. During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family.","The mother sought an order that would provide parenting provisions and child maintenance payable to her in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines in the form of a table amount and contribution to special or extraordinary expenses and that retroactivity of child maintenance for the period from August 2001 to December 2007. The parties separated in August 2001. Prior to the Consent Order, there was no written agreement or court order dealing with child maintenance. The father applied for relief pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act in October 2007. Consent Order dated January 9, 2009 provided relief to almost all of the issues raised in the proceeding, including ongoing child maintenance beginning January 4, 2008. What remains for decision is what responsibility, if any, the father has to retroactively provide child maintenance since the couple separated in 2001 up to the end of 2007. Hardship Occasioned by Retroactive Award The mother acknowledged that she was under an incorrect assumption as to the father's income while being over extended given her responsibilities as to caring for Ryan and her aging parents. She was consistently being told by the father that she did not have the financial ability to provide additional child maintenance and that the order would be retroactive to the date of the couple's separation. The court found that the father was paying less than legally required given his income and the dictates of the Guidelines and that this failure to provide income in accordance was a blameworthy conduct.","As a result, the only remaining issue was, as acknowledged in the Consent Order, the retroactivity of child maintenance (table and section 7 expenses) for the period from August, 2001, to and including December, 2007. At that time, given his knowledge that his obligation was equated to his income, I find Mr. Jeffrey had “effective notice” that his current payment was deficient. [42] I found that Mr. Jeffrey’s dramatic increase in salary was in and of itself “sufficient notice” his child maintenance obligation (table amount) had to be increased. [44] Ms. Jeffrey’s request for a retroactive award with regard to the section 7 expenses is denied. [45] It is ordered that Mr. Jeffrey has a responsibility to provide child maintenance to Ms. Jeffrey for their child, Ryan, beginning January 1, 2005, and ending January 31, 2007; further, that he is in arrears with regard to this obligation in the amount of $9,833.00.",0.4362745098039215,"At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007).

The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines. She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it. The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands. Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward. The father's hardship arguments rejected. He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income.

The Court found that the father has been paying less than legally required given his income and the dictates of the Guidelines.

Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home. The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson. The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds. Lanson attempted to seize the home. The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.

Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. 3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.  4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. 5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer.

No City employees were working on the site. ISSUES: 1)Is the picketing secondary picketing? 2)Is the manner of picketing unlawful in any event? HELD: Application allowed. 1)Picketing of the premises of an employer, where there is no direct dispute between him and the picketers or between him and his employees, is secondary picketing, is per se unlawful and cannot be jusified merely because the picketers are engaged in a legal strike against another employer who has business relations with the employer being picketed. 2)If the court had determined that the subject picketing was not secondary picketing, then, in the particular circumstances it would still have held that the subject picketing was unlawful, and ought to be restrained, as, on the whole of said evidence it was satisfied that the applicant had established that said picketing was not being carried on for the purpose of lawful communication, but, rather, was being carried on in a manner designed to obstruct, impede and interfere with the lawful performance by the applicant of its construction contract on the construction site.","The plaintiff sought an interim and interlocutory injunction restraining the defendants from engaging in secondary picketing of the plaintiff's premises and preventing them from interfering with the lawful use and improvement of the construction site.

The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear. A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized. The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

Awarding the plaintiff $724,000 for past and future loss of income, future loss of pension, and general damages, that based on the evidence of the possible complications from surgery such as an abortion, and considering the emotional impact of an abortion on all women, the defendants breached their standard of care as health care professionals in permitting the plaintiff to drive after the abortion.","The plaintiff took part in a separate action against the defendants after she was injured in a motor vehicle accident. She alleged that the defendants were negligent in allowing her to drive home alone. She also alleged that one defendant, Louise Brodeur, did not exist and was simply listed as a defendant by mistake. The parties agreed to certain facts which were admitted to be correct. 1)The plaintiff was permitted to drive a distance of approximately 20 miles after a therapeutic abortion. The motor vehicle collision occurred between the defendant's vehicle and the plaintiff's vehicle. The defendant operated the 'MacPhail Vehicle' in an Easterly direction on Highway #103 towards exit 4.

e_2007skca122.txt,"This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs.","This was an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant against the respondents, the Bjorkdale Lions Club and the Village of Bjorksdale. The appellant suffered burns of varying degree to various parts of his body and arm. He was burned when gasoline from the gas tank located behind the driver's seat of the vehicle he was driving splashed on him and was set on fire shortly afterwards, after he had signalled his desire to have the contest halted and his vehicle had come to stop. The flagman's failure to immediately halt the competition on noticing the presence of gasoline in the interior of the appellant's vehicle was bound to have immediately stopped the competition and alerted the Fire Department to this condition. HELD: The appeal was dismissed to the extent it took issue with Justice Rothery's decision to withdraw her case from jury. The trial judge applied the right test in addressing the motion, having addressed it along the lines of whether the plaintiff had adduced sufficient evidence, considered in its best light, to enable the jury, properly instructed and acting judicially, to find the defendants or either them liable in negligence.","Disposition: Appeal Dismissed

The 41 month lease required a monthly rental of $500 for the first five months and thereafter semi-annual payments of $5,000. The tenants had not paid any rent in 1998 nor had they maintained insurance; they installed alternating stalls in the barn in breach of their covenant not to make any alterations or additions to the premises; breached the express and implied covenants to keep the premises in good condition and tenantable repair by their failure to remove and properly dispose of baler twine, to maintain proper weed control or to remove manure buildup in the calf barn. The tenants admitted the rental payment was due in May but claimed the landlord breached the pre-condition wherein Russell's husband promised to repair the damage caused by a 1995 hail storm. The claims for repair was far in excess of those provided for in the lease which were the tenant's responsibility._____ HELD: 1)The landlord was entitled to a writ of possession since the tenants were in breach of the covenant to pay rent for more than two calendar months. 2)A trial of the issue was ordered to determine whether the tenants were in breach of covenants in the lease. The matter should not be decided summarily where there are questions of fact or law. The hail damage may allow the tenants to claim in damages against the landlord but it could not be construed as a debt due for the purposes of s27 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The remaining alleged breaches could not be determined summarily.  3)Costs of the application were awarded to the landlord in any event of the cause.","The landlord applied for an order for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of The Landlord and Tenant Act.

The property was for 41 months up to and including April 1999. The tenants were in arrears of rent by more than two months and the rent was outstanding for more thantwo calendar months. The landlord admitted the payment due May 1, 1998 was not made because, they allege, Russell has breached the lease(clause 5.2) and because there was a pre-condition to thelease wherein the husband promised to repair the damageto the premises from a hail storm which occurred in August 1995 and the damage has never been repaired. The claims for repair were far in excess of those provided for in clause 3.1 of the lease. HELD: A trial of the issue was directed to determine whether the respondents were in breach of the covenant to pay rent, the rent is outstanding and the tenant is required to give notice of the claim of set off to the landlord.  1)The issue should not be decided summarily but should bedecided in an action (Vogelgesang and Kennedy v. WilliamsHoldings Ltd. (1981), 1981 CanLII 2300). Accordingly, only two issues need to be addressed, namely the non-payment of rent and the alleged failure to maintain proper weed control. 2)The defendant was the plaintiff and the defendants in any such action and the Rules of Court generally will govern the conduct of that action.","[1] The landlord, Gertrude Russell (""Russell""), applies

c_2002skqb47.txt,"FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store. The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43. The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused. The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to. The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports. At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs. Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party. 2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages. 3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value. Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case. Expenses of each was examined separately. In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant. 4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee. A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel. The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court. It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant.

The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.  1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid.

The Court concluded that the accused was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and in particular pages and (the latter outlining, as it was intended to do, the proposed offences in the area) was inadequate and unsatisfactory to meet the minimum offence description requirements contemplated by Form S. 24 of the Code as those requirements were further interpreted and identified to apply in the Dombrowski and Alder cases.","[6] The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search (the “Application”).

He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son.

Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed; the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault.

The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent. The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner. The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children. For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time. The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children. The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis. The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come. The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children. HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement. The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children. The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement. The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order. The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased. The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed. The respondent was awarded costs.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to vary the consent parenting judgment and the consent child support order granted by Justice R. S. Smith on February 2, 2007.

The parenting judgment contemplated in detail the parenting arrangement that has been followed. The respondent as single parent was able to access the petitioner 50% of the time. However, the petitioner's income on equal parenting was clearly provided for in the original parenting judgment. 2) The petitioner has not satisfied that a material change of circumstance has occurred. There has been no health or welfare issues to be resolved through consultation. 3) The respondent has not managed to resolve material issues with respect to the children's health and well-being. It is obvious that the children will continue to provide basic maintenance with no deduction based on increased parenting time.","[1] The petitioner applies to vary the consent parenting judgment and the consent child support order granted by Justice R.

The daughter resided with her mother. Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends. The children were to be together most weekends. School vacations would be shared. 3)The father was to pay monthly child support of $485 based on his gross salary of $61,200 which included a $1500 car allowance. Expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities did not qualify as a special or extraordinary expense. The father was to contribute his proportionate share (73% to reflect spousal maintenance) of orthodontic expenses not covered by insurance. 4)Spousal maintenance of $900 was to be reviewable after December 31, 2003.

For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis. In the divorce proceeding, the mother, who planned to remarry and relocate, sought to become the primary caregiver of the children, with the father to have access only every second weekend. The father sought to vary the parenting time so that both parents would equally share their time with the children. Current parenting arrangement to remain in effect with the parties retaining joint custody of the children; table amount of child support set. The parenting pattern followed for the past five years had been working well for the children and appeared to be serving their needs; the mother's proposal would lessen the children's time with their father and the father's proposal would also create a significant change for the children, removing their current home base.","The parties' parenting time with their two children has been distributed on a two-week basis. For the last five years, the parties have shared child care cost of $800 per month. The parties will retain the interest they acquired in their own pensions. Spousal support is to be paid in the amount of $647 per month beginning June 1, 2006. The parents agree to be designated joint custodians of their children. HELD: The court ordered that the current parenting arrangements remain in effect with the exception of the change regarding Remembrance Day.  1) The expense to Ms. Thomson is actually less than $800 as she obtains income tax relief at least with regard to the sum of the $400.00 that she was contributing; 2) The parties have been able to perform this difficult parenting task in their children's best interest for a 5-year period. The alternating of Remembrance day would not appear to be contrary to the children's interest and would appear beneficial to the parents. The court was satisfied all matters of jurisdiction had been fulfilled. The requirements of the Divorce Act had been complied with in all respects and the grounds for divorce as alleged was proved.  3) The costs of child care were not included in the calculation of the child care costs. 4) The parents agreed to share child care expenses for the first five years of their marriage. 5) The children have been following the same pattern in their interaction with their parents. There has been no suggestion that this routine has been, or will be, harmful to them. There was no evidence presented to show that this current situation was, or would be, detrimental to their academic or social life. The Court was allowed to take into account the reasonableness of such an expense in relation to the means of the spouses.","[5] The parties will retain the interest they have acquired in their own pensions. ISSUES [8] Ms. Thomson seeks to become the primary care giver for the children and for Mr. Thomson\'s access to take place every second weekend. However, in providing documents for the trial, Ms. Thomson indicated she plans to remarry and relocate and seeks to have the time the children spend in Mr. Thomson\'s care reduced. [20] The current regular parenting arrangements would appear to be serving the children\'s needs. [21] Ms. Thomson\'s suggestion would create a distinct change in the time the children would have with their father. [22] Mr. Thomson\'s suggested variation does not create such a change as proposed by Ms. Thomson\'s but a significant change nevertheless. They have, to a degree, a home base.

2_2009nssc364.txt,"The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008. It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time. At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment. The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support. He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement. The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce. The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008). The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable. He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife. The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement. This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act. It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome). The terms of the agreement must be given great deference. Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act? The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made. Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult. Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated. Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party. To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them. The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it. The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements. His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).","This was a decision in the matter of Nicolas Grady and Gallegos Grady. A divorce hearing was held in October 2009 and November 2, 2009. The parties marriage was established; the court's jurisdiction to grant divorce was established, the grounds for the divorce were established and there being no bars to the divorce, the divorce was granted. The petitioner applied to have the spousal and child support obligations reflected in paragraph 9 of the separation agreement changed in as much as he sought a corollary relief judgment that would not contain this obligation. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The Corollary Relief judgment is at variance with the parties' separation agreement. 2) There is no evidence that the parties did not enter a binding agreement or that the agreement was not binding at the time it was entered. 3) The petitioner has been paying his father $3,000 per month pursuant to a buy out agreement pertaining to his interest in the business since January 2009. There may be changes in circumstances in the future. These changes (no matter how radical or unforeseen) will not have the effect of setting aside the terms of this agreement as the terms relate to division of property and to variation of an agreement incorporated into an order under s17. In our view, the Act does not create an inconsistency. 4) The court has a wide discretion to determine what amount of support, if any, should be ordered based solely on the factors set out in s17(7).

On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court. The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources. On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004. On May 6, 2004, the trial was adjourned on application by the Crown due to the non-attendance of the complainant and new trial date was set for October 7, 2004. HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed. 1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months. This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry. 2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children. There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this. 3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking. As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused. 3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence.","The accused applied for relief pursuant to The Charter of Rights and Freedoms on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There was no Charter breach. The accused did not contribute to the remaining delay. He appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charge set for trial. 2)The Court found no actual or inferred prejudice. The conditions of release he is subject to are not soerous as to result in any significant prejudice to him or to infer that he has suffered prejudice over and above that suffered by others charged with similar offences. The Court found that the prejudice to the accused in the delay was not such a significant issue as to outweigh the prejudice that would result if the accused was not to face trial. 3)The court found that in this case the accused had not suffered actual prejudice because the restrictive condition in the undertaking preventing him from contacting the complainant and it is therefore argued that he was prevented from having access to his children in her care. 4)The accused was charged with three intervening offences of breaching his undertaking which he attributes to the delay. The six months between the first and second trial dates consider as attributable to the Crown, it being necessary because of the non-attendance of the complainant who was under subpoena to attend. 5)There is no evidence of any efforts by the accused to overcome this prejudice.

d_2011skqb62.txt,"The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon. The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants. At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience. No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon.

The Crown argued that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The Crown's appeal was dismissed. 1) The trial judge found that the Crown had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended to use the sword as a weapon, or that it likely came from a novelty store. 2) The Crown sought to admit the evidence of the appellant on the basis that he had experience with the type of sword in issue. As he had no bag or back pack in which to carry it, he tucked it into his shorts. He did not usually carry weapons for protection. He was not testifying as to his eye witness perceptions, but about the sword and where it could be purchased. 3) There was insufficient evidence upon which the Crown could conclude that the defence had not proven beyond a reasonably reasonable doubt the weapon was a weapon within the meaning of s. 2 of the Code. However, there was sufficient evidence on the part of the Crown to conclude that it was a decorative sword and not a novelty sword. 4) The Court reviewed the Crown's case and concluded that the appellant had not demonstrated that he was unable to convey to the trier of fact the data from which the inference was drawn or that the inference had been formed. 5) The test for admissibility is determined by asking whether the evidence sought to be admitted is relevant. This is a matter of applying logic and experience to the circumstances of the particular case. The question which must then be asked is whether, though probative, the evidence must be excluded by clear ground of policy or of law. The Court of Appeal provides a useful description of when an instrument may be found to be weapon on a prima facie basis: One must, I think, start with the premise that a knife, being an instrument that is universally used for utilitarian, peaceful purposes is not prima-facie designed to be used as a weapons.

One must, at the outset, start with a premise that the blade is a 'brilliant' type of weapon, in the same manner that a firearm, or brass knuckles or other inherently dangerous items are considered weapons.

b_2006skqb183.txt,"The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years. The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","The plaintiffs sued for damages arising to them from alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the golf course and for a permanent injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property over the past nine years. HELD: The court found that the plaintiffs were entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which had continued for the past 9 years. The court did not order the specific course of action that the defendants should take in order to remedy the problem.  1) The plaintiffs were awarded costs of $18,000 for the loss of use and enjoyment of their property during the course.  2) The defendants refused to accept either of the recommendations in the report. They were also ordered to pay $6,000 to the plaintiffs for damages which were caused by golf balls flying from the adjacent golf course onto their property for 7 months of the year.  3) The plaintiff was also awarded costs for damage to their home and their vehicles.  4) The defendant was to be responsible for those damages which had arisen since they became the owners. 5) The court held that few golf balls of 10-20 over a 5-year period with limited damage to property did not constitute a continuing nuisance. 6) Since the problem has been ongoing for ten years and the attempts by the defendant operator to ameliorate the damage has been unsatisfactory, the plaintiffs are no longer prepared to wait and have asked the Court for relief in the form of an injunction to prevent the defendant from operating the ninth hole until the situation has been remedied in accordance with the recommendations of the expert. 7) It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of 7 months would be an interference with the use of the property.","1) This is an action by the plaintiffs, Cattell, Mack, Bosenberg and Strassburg pursuant to Part Forty of The Queen’s Bench Rules for damages arising to them from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd., and for a permanent injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the property of the plaintiffs. 36) There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole of the Emerald Park Golf Course is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance. 40) It would appear to me that this clause is of little value to the defendants given that the evidence of all of the parties, including the evidence of Ben Kuzmicz, confirms the fact that when the residential area was developed and the contract was signed, no one, including the operator (Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd.), anticipated the extent of the existing problem and, accordingly, the plaintiffs Cattell and Mack could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 42) Accordingly, the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd., are therefore liable to all of the plaintiffs in negligence for the failure over the past years to remedy or eliminate this hazardous and dangerous situation. 44) The plaintiffs, Morley Cattell and Cheryl Mack, shall also be entitled to recover from the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd., Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd. and The Town of White City, jointly and severally, the sum of $18,000.00 for the loss of use and enjoyment of their property over the past nine years. 45) In addition, for the reasons as outlined in the preceding paragraphs, I am of the view that the plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which has continued for the past nine years.

An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001. Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc. The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000. Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship. The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4). Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment. The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate. Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not. To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1).","FIAT: This application by two siblings to act as personal decision-maker and property guardian for their 68-year-old mother is opposed by the Public Trustee insofar as they request they be appointed property guardians without the necessity of a bond.

e_1999skqb106.txt,"FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement.

The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.","HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the defendant corporations were obliged to answer questions related to the mode of transportation of helicopter flights and the operator of such flights. The only significance of the plaintiffs identifying the theories they may hold behind any questioning with respect to these issues is that by disclosing the theory, it is easier to determine whether such questioning is or could be logically relevant to the overall allegation of unsafe operation. The Court found that allowing questions on whether the project was over-budget at any particular time does not mean the plaintiffs are entitled to question the details of the budget, or why money was spent in certain areas as opposed to other areas. The report of the safety officer at the main camp site was not privileged because he was requested to prepare safety report prior to the accident but did not get around to it until after the accident.","Background [2] The action arises out of a helicopter crash which occurred in the Republic of Kyrgyzstan on October 4, 1995 which resulted in the death of three crew members and 12 passengers. [7] The plaintiffs allege that one or more of the above defendants carried on a negligent and reckless helicopter shuttle operation to and from the work site. [11] Based on the joinder of issues set out in the foregoing, the plaintiffs are entitled to question the respective officers of the defendant corporations, and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of: Answers to all of these questions are logically relevant to the choice made by one or more of the defendants because they are factors one would expect any decision maker to take into account in deciding a specific form of transportation, and are also relevant to test the credibility of answers that may be provided by the corporate officers with respect to the reasons for the choices made. The defendant corporations therefore are obliged to answer questions directed at whether insurance was obtained, and if so who arranged and paid for the same. If the defendant, KOC is in a position to determine when such survival gear was placed on board the helicopters, the question should be answered. [27] The corporate officer examined on behalf of Cameco was asked to produce records as to when airfare tickets were reserved and purchased by Mr. Vernon Kiss and Mr. Bernard Michel for a meeting which took place in London on April 12, 1995. If not, leave is granted to reapply for direction. The relevant defendants are therefore ordered to date any document for which privilege is claimed. [38] However, counsel’s request that the persons who prepared the document and received the document be named, is simply an attempt to investigate the investigation conducted by the defendants which I noted in Auchstaetter v. Froese, 1995 CanLII 5631 (SK QB), [1995] 4 W.W.R. 716 (Sask. Q.B.) is not permitted for the reasons outlined therein. [39] If a person disclosed his or her pre-accident observations to someone in the subsequent investigation which is privileged, that person’s observations are disclosable. To the extent the defendants have knowledge of persons who made observations relevant to the matters in issue, the names of such persons must be disclosed if requested after the answer provided by the defendant corporate officer discloses relevant information emanating from that person. As a result I feel I should review this Report before making a decision with respect to its privileged status. [46] The employment agreement signed by employees of KOC contained a confidentiality clause, the wording of which is not important in view of the ruling I propose to make, and the release documents signed by employees who terminated their employment with KOC also contained a clause in which the employee agreed not to disclose any proprietary information learned during the employment. In view of the fact the employee has contracted not to disclose business information, which is a broad enough category to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer, With the foregoing restriction there will be an order that information given by this employee to plaintiffs’ counsel with respect to the matters in issue does not amount to a breach of the confidentiality clause contained in the employment agreement or the release document signed by him. [48] The chronology document is privileged on the basis it represents the work product of a privileged investigation. [49] Plaintiffs’ counsel has not established the necessary criteria pursuant to Rule 222(a) of the Rules of Court to justify examining for discovery the two former employees referred to in the material. [50] The request to explore post-accident conduct and activity on the part of senior executives of one or more of the corporate defendants on examination for discovery is also dismissed. [51] Defendants’ counsel’s request pursuant to Rule 142 to obtain from the plaintiffs particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim including particulars of the sections allegedly breached, is proper. [53] With respect to the names of potential witnesses, defence counsel are entitled to a reciprocal order to that made in favour of the plaintiffs. The names of persons who have provided facts or observations prior to the accident to counsel for the plaintiffs’ relevant to the issues are to be disclosed in the same circumstances outlined with respect to the order in favour of the plaintiffs. [55] With respect to the question on whether the wife of a deceased person can be asked if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe, the question calls for a lay opinion, and the only matter the question is relevant to is the character of her late husband.",0.2316442605997932,"FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.","The plaintiffs allege that one or more of the above defendants carried on a negligent and reckless helicopter shuttle operation to and from the work site.

Questions related to the other six theories are clearly irrelevant as they are not raised by the pleadings. The only significance of the plaintiffs identifying the theories they may hold behind the claim is that by disclosing the theory it is easier to determine whether such questioning is warranted. The plaintiffs' wish to explore theory that cost was major consideration in the defendants' continued use of Kyrgyzstan National Air as a shuttle service is also relevant. The same is true of any decisions involving the transportation of goods or services made by the defendants.  7) The only relevance is whether cost entered into the defendants’ choice to utilize Kyrgyza National Air (KOC) and state that KOC was a separate and distinct corporation which operates the Kumtor Project independently and of its own will by its own Board of Directors. Any decisions involving transportation made by KOC were made by it independently of Cameco, Cameco Gold and Kumtor Mountain.

In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck. HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.  2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears.

This patent defect, and the arbitrator’s implicit finding that the hotel violated Article 9:01 of the collective agreement, is such that it warrants the intervention of the court on judicial review. [37] Accordingly, the application is granted and an Order will be issued setting aside the award of the arbitrator.",0.5346062052505968,"This was an application for judicial review of the decision of a labour arbitrator released on July 21, 2000 in respect of a grievance arbitration heard in Sydney, Nova Scotia on May 10, 2000. The arbitration involved the interpretation of certain seniority provisions of collective agreement between the parties. The grievor was a member of the respondent union and had been employed at the Delta Sydney hotel since 1989. At the time of the grievance, she was employed in the front desk department. Her return from maternity leave had not resulted in a reduction of available hours for employees with less departmental seniority than she. She was the first to experience reduction of work hours when she took up her new position. HELD: The arbitrator found that the wording of Article 9:01 was wide enough to encompass the situation and that the appellant's interpretation could not be said to be patently unreasonable. The appellant's conclusion ascribes meaning to that clause which its words cannot reasonably bear and which was apparently not argued before her at the arbitration hearing. Although there was clear evidentiary support for her essential findings of fact, the court was unable to determine the existence of any logical process by which the final conclusion could be drawn.",0.5744680851063829

The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal. The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so. The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony. The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed. The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

2001skqb148.txt,"FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs.","The plaintiff sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188 that the following parts of the plaintiff's claim stand dismissed: the entirety of the claim against the Attorney General, Leslie Sullivan and Bruce Bauer; and the entire claim based on the alleged breach of Charter rights. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs under double Column V and the (sic) other below set aside. The court found that the limitation period did not run from the expiration of the stay and that the application should not be allowed because it was not commenced within the time limit prescribed in s. 2(1)(a) of the Public Officers' Protection Act.","In the one the defendants, the Government of Saskatchewan, the Attorney General for Saskatchewan, C. Richard Quinney, Q.C., Leslie Sullivan and Bruce Bauer, seek an order pursuant to Queen\'s Bench Rules 173(a) and 188 that the following parts of the plaintiff\'s claim stand dismissed:

(i) the entirety of the claim against the Attorney General for Saskatchewan;

(ii) the entirely of the claim against C. Richard Quinney, Q.C., Leslie Sullivan and Bruce Bauer; and

(iii) the claim against the Government of Saskatchewan (except for that part of the claim based on the alleged breach of Charter rights). [2] In the second motion the defendants, Wayne McGillivray and Michael Johnston, also seek to have the plaintiff\'s claim dismissed. Likewise, their application is grounded in Queen\'s Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, but they also rely on Rule 173(e). [3] The third motion is brought by the plaintiff who seeks several orders of which two were granted summarily and one was adjourned sine die. [4] The two applications of the defendants, insofar as they are based on Rule 188, are dismissed. That rule provides for a determination of a point of law. Even though the applications are grounded in a limitation period, there still is a factual component and absent an agreed statement of facts there should not be an order granted under Rule 188. [5] As I see it, the remaining substantive issues which need to be determined can be summarized as follows. (1) Whether the plaintiff\'s claim is barred by a statutory limitation period. (3) Whether a portion of the plaintiff\'s claim fails to disclose a cause of action against Quinney, Sullivan, Bauer, McGillivray and Johnston because there is no allegation of malice. (4) Whether the plaintiff\'s claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan is barred by statute. The plaintiff claims general damages, special damages, punitive damages, aggravated damages, interest and costs. Accordingly the plaintiff's claim is determined to be statute-barred upon Section 51 of the Limitation of Actions Act.  The cause of action had fully accrued and the appellant had a prima facie case. To fairly determine whether that was so, there must be a hearing to determine the facts and that is best done at trial. The appeal must be allowed. The appeal is therefore allowed with costs under double Column V, and the (sic) other below is set aside. Accordingly, the application to dismiss the plaintiff's claim as being statute barred should be dismissed. The plaintiff now applies for an order granting such further time, the order to be retroactive to September 9, 1994. He has demonstrated a prima facie cause of action and I need say no more about that. When I consider the condition and state of the plaintiff at the relevant time, together with all of the presenting circumstances, a reasonable explanation for the delay has been put forward. [42] Most importantly, I am satisfied that no prejudice will flow to the defendants. [44] When I reflect upon the time, effort and money expended in the pursuit of this action by all parties over the past six years, I am convinced that the only reasonable course is to grant a retroactive order. Those parties seek to have the particular pleadings struck on the ground that they enjoy an immunity absent an allegation of malice or bad faith. Absent such an allegation the pleadings disclose no cause of action and should be struck as to the Crown Attorneys. I read the statutory provision as providing immunity to the Saskatchewan Police Commission and people engaged in its work. In my view, the Crown is rendered immune by the express terms of s. 5(6) of the Act from liability to the appellant. [53] As I read the Act and the decisions, I do not conclude that the Crown enjoys an absolute immunity. Therefore, this claim should be permitted to proceed along with the claim based on the Charter of Rights. No advance notice, so far as I know, was given to the other parties. Absent such notice, I am not prepared to entertain the request. (1) that the applications by the several defendants to have this action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period are dismissed; (2) that the application by the defendants, McGillivray and Johnston, to have the claim in negligence struck as against them is dismissed; (3) that the application by the defendants, Quinney, Sullivan and Bauer, to have the claim in negligence struck as against them is allowed and paragraphs 45, 46, 46A, 47 and 48 of the statement of claim are struck, but without prejudice to the plaintiff to apply to amend the pleadings; (4) that the application by the Government of Saskatchewan is granted in part such that the claim is dismissed against it except for the claims alleging conspiracy and breach of Charter rights; (5) that the application of the plaintiff is allowed and it is ordered that the time to bring the within action is extended to September 10, 1994, said order to be retroactive to September 8, 1994;",0.21193415637860083,"FIAT.

The plaintiff now applies for an order granting such further time, the order to be retroactive to September 9, 1994. He has demonstrated a prima facie cause of action and I need say no more about that. When I consider the condition and state of the plaintiff at the relevant time, together with all of the presenting circumstances, a reasonable explanation for the delay has been put forward. [42] Most importantly, I am satisfied that no prejudice will flow to the defendants. [44] When I reflect upon the time, effort and money expended in the pursuit of this action by all parties over the past six years, I am convinced that the only reasonable course is to grant a retroactive order. Those parties seek to have the particular pleadings struck on the ground that they enjoy an immunity absent an allegation of malice or bad faith. Absent such an allegation the pleadings disclose no cause of action and should be struck as to the Crown Attorneys. I read the statutory provision as providing immunity to the Saskatchewan Police Commission and people engaged in its work. In my view, the Crown is rendered immune by the express terms of s. 5(6) of the Act from liability to the appellant. [53] As I read the Act and the decisions, I do not conclude that the Crown enjoys an absolute immunity. Therefore, this claim should be permitted to proceed along with the claim based on the Charter of Rights. No advance notice, so far as I know, was given to the other parties. Absent such notice, I am not prepared to entertain the request. (1) that the applications by the several defendants to have this action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period are dismissed; (2) that the application by the defendants, McGillivray and Johnston, to have the claim in negligence struck as against them is dismissed; (3) that the application by the defendants, Quinney, Sullivan and Bauer, to have the claim in negligence struck as against them is allowed and paragraphs 45, 46, 46A, 47 and 48 of the statement of claim are struck, but without prejudice to the plaintiff to apply to amend the pleadings; (4) that the application by the Government of Saskatchewan is granted in part such that the claim is dismissed against it except for the claims alleging conspiracy and breach of Charter rights; (5) that the application of the plaintiff is allowed and it is ordered that the time to bring the within action is extended to September 10, 1994, said order to be retroactive to September 8, 1994;",0.3209876543209877,"FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs.","FIAT. Three motions were brought. The first motion sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(a) and 188 that the plaintiff's claim be struck because it was not commenced within the time limit prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act. The second motion sought to have the action dismissed. HELD: 1) The plaintiff had a prima facie case. He knew then that the limitation period was extended. 2) Even though the applications are grounded in a limitation period, there still is a factual component and absent an agreed statement of facts there should not be an order granted under Rule 188. 3) The appeal is allowed with costs under double Column V, and the other below is set aside. 4) The claim is not restricted to events prior to the entry of the stay of proceedings by the Crown. The cause of action has fully accrued and the appellant had a case. The limitation period is extended by a year. 5) The application for an order extending limitation period nunc pro tunc is dismissed. 6) The remaining substantive issues which need to be determined can be determined by the Court of Appeal.","In the one the defendants, the Government of Saskatchewan, the Attorney General for Saskatchewan, C. Richard Quinney, Q.C., Leslie Sullivan and Bruce Bauer, seek an order pursuant to Queen\'s Bench Rules 173(a) and 188 that the following parts of the plaintiff\'s claim stand dismissed:

(i) the entirety of the claim against the Attorney General for Saskatchewan;

(ii) the entirely of the claim against C. Richard Quinney, Q.C., Leslie Sullivan and Bruce Bauer; and

(iii) the claim against the Government of Saskatchewan (except for that part of the claim based on the alleged breach of Charter rights). [2] In the second motion the defendants, Wayne McGillivray and Michael Johnston, also seek to have the plaintiff\'s claim dismissed. Likewise, their application is grounded in Queen\'s Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, but they also rely on Rule 173(e). [3] The third motion is brought by the plaintiff who seeks several orders of which two were granted summarily and one was adjourned sine die. [4] The two applications of the defendants, insofar as they are based on Rule 188, are dismissed. That rule provides for a determination of a point of law. Even though the applications are grounded in a limitation period, there still is a factual component and absent an agreed statement of facts there should not be an order granted under Rule 188. [5] As I see it, the remaining substantive issues which need to be determined can be summarized as follows. (1) Whether the plaintiff\'s claim is barred by a statutory limitation period. (3) Whether a portion of the plaintiff\'s claim fails to disclose a cause of action against Quinney, Sullivan, Bauer, McGillivray and Johnston because there is no allegation of malice. (4) Whether the plaintiff\'s claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan is barred by statute. The plaintiff claims general damages, special damages, punitive damages, aggravated damages, interest and costs. Accordingly the plaintiff's claim is determined to be statute-barred upon Section 51 of the Limitation of Actions Act.  The cause of action had fully accrued and the appellant had a prima facie case. To fairly determine whether that was so, there must be a hearing to determine the facts and that is best done at trial. The appeal must be allowed. The appeal is therefore allowed with costs under double Column V, and the (sic) other below is set aside.

The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David. First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity. When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate. Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application. The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.  1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable. 3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.  4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable. The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due.

It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances. DISSENT: The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date. The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation.

e_2007skqb174.txt,"The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","The respondent applied by notice of motion dated June 26, 2006, to vary the judgment of Justice Foley.

9_2004skqb324.txt,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","Walgreens applied to the Court for judicial review to quash two orders made pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing the orders. These orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents, including those referred to in the subpoena duces tecum and in a series of production orders, process that infringes the substantive rights of the Board. The Board declined to comment on the offending provisions. HELD: A review of the transcript is essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record. There are virtually no reasons given by the Board in its written decision as to why it ordered each and every document, memo or communication sought by UFCW or why it rejected all the submissions made by counsel for Wal- Mart Canada respecting it. The only reference to the relevancy requirement is that the Board did not address Mr. Beckman's concerns or objections in any meaningful fashion but ignored them.","[1] Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to The Queen’s Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing the orders of the Board made on May 21, 2004 and June 24, 2004.

[2] Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order pursuant to s. 24 of Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11, declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. T-17, unconstitutional and of no force and effect insofar as it infringes the freedom of thought, belief, expression and communication under s. 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B of the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11. [11] UFCW brought an application before the Board for an order for certification respecting certain employees of Wal-Mart Canada at its Weyburn store. The application is contested by Wal-Mart Canada and by certain Wal-Mart Canada employees who are designated by the Board as “Interested Parties”. With respect to items 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, given that issues have been raised with respect to employer influence or interference and the status of department managers, we are of the opinion that the Employer shall produce the following documents: “Wal-Mart Manager’s Toolbox to Remaining Union Free”; the current “Wal-Mart Associate Handbook”; the document entitled “To the New Wal-Mart Associate” and other documents provided to newly hired employees; Corporate Policies CPD-42 and COP-08 as referred to in the Wal-Mart Associate Handbook; documents and communication to employees regarding trade unions or unionization; documents regarding the operational status of store departments and the concept of “Store within Store”. [39] I conclude that a review of the transcript is essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must, in this case, be considered part of the record. In my respectful view, the Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in the case before me in two respects. There is accordingly no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy respecting the documents specified in the subpoena or the host of documents that might fall within the ambit of the generalized terms of the subpoena. [57] The second reason for my conclusion that the Board abused its jurisdiction and power respecting the subpoena, is that the subpoena is far too generalized and, in reality, amounts in many instances to an order to discover documents. [66] Many of the comments I have made respecting the subpoena duces tecum issued by the Board in this case, apply in principle to the Board’s document discovery and production orders. I have concluded for the reasons I will outline, that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its powers in making the discovery and production orders it did against Wal-Mart Canada. [81] As well, the Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of this Court and the Court of Appeal. In my view, the only feasible option open to me is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two impugned orders. 1. The orders of the Board dated May 21, 2004 and June 14, 2004 are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. 2. The short-term stay of the proceedings of the Board that extended on July 13, 2004 is terminated forthwith. 3. The application by Wal-Mart Canada for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back to the Court after the Board has rendered its decision or once Wal-Mart Canada can provide a better factual foundation and context to support its application.",0.31664726426076834,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board.

These orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents, including those referred to in a subpoena duces tecum. [2] Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order pursuant to s. 24 of Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11, declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. T-17, unconstitutional and of no force and effect insofar as it infringes the freedom of thought, belief, expression and communication under s. 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B of the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11. [11] UFCW brought an application before the Board for an order for certification respecting certain employees of Wal-Mart Canada at its Weyburn store. The application is contested by Wal-Mart Canada and by certain Wal-Mart Canada employees who are designated by the Board as “Interested Parties”. With respect to items 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, given that issues have been raised with respect to employer influence or interference and the status of department managers, we are of the opinion that the Employer shall produce the following documents: “Wal-Mart Manager’s Toolbox to Remaining Union Free”; the current “Wal-Mart Associate Handbook”; the document entitled “To the New Wal-Mart Associate” and other documents provided to newly hired employees; Corporate Policies CPD-42 and COP-08 as referred to in the Wal-Mart Associate Handbook; documents and communication to employees regarding trade unions or unionization; documents regarding the operational status of store departments and the concept of “Store within Store”. [39] I conclude that a review of the transcript is essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must, in this case, be considered part of the record. In my respectful view, the Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in the case before me in two respects. There is accordingly no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy respecting the documents specified in the subpoena or the host of documents that might fall within the ambit of the generalized terms of the subpoena. [57] The second reason for my conclusion that the Board abused its jurisdiction and power respecting the subpoena, is that the subpoena is far too generalized and, in reality, amounts in many instances to an order to discover documents. [66] Many of the comments I have made respecting the subpoena duces tecum issued by the Board in this case, apply in principle to the Board’s document discovery and production orders. I have concluded for the reasons I will outline, that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its powers in making the discovery and production orders it did against Wal-Mart Canada. [81] As well, the Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of this Court and the Court of Appeal. In my view, the only feasible option open to me is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two impugned orders. 1. The orders of the Board dated May 21, 2004 and June 14, 2004 are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. 2. The short-term stay of the proceedings of the Board that extended on July 13, 2004 is terminated forthwith. 3. The application by Wal-Mart Canada for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back to the Court after the Board has rendered its decision or once Wal-Mart Canada can provide a better factual foundation and context to support its application.",0.5362595419847328,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","Walgreens applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing the orders of the Board.

The agreement provided for monthly compensation based on the net written premium on new policies written during the previous month and renewal compensation calculated in accordance with the average renewals for the prior two quarters. The contract also provided for relocation counselling. The plaintiff was to receive pro-rated amount to November 5, 1991, for the first two years of his employment with the defendant. At age 50, he would presumably be limited to contacting persons for whom he had no prior business dealings or associations, unless he had previously been unsuccessful in selling them insurance on behalf of the defendant; his prospects for developing a book of repeat clients was not as great as it was in his 20's particularly when he was precluded for two years from soliciting or selling insurance to persons he had earlier sold insurance to.

Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times). The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded. If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that.

A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance. Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.","This was a divorce proceeding. The parties had been in a relationship for approximately years. They had two children and years of age. The wife requested an equal time shared parenting arrangement. The children were in the husband's care every second weekend. The husband requested sole custody with the children in the wife's care. The court found that the wife had demonstrated a depressing lack of cooperation. She did not take the opportunity to meet with the husband personally and of the requests he made in respect of the children. She often did not reply to his inquiries. HELD: While shared parenting is inappropriate for these children what about joint custody? Conflict between parents does not necessarily mean joint custody is inappropriate. The evidence suggests what violence there has been between the parties was often initiated by the wife. However, this did not occur with the consent of the husband. Discussions about what is an appropriate decision to make for child's benefit should not be overwhelmed in a power struggle between the parents.","Result: The children were placed in the husband’s sole care and custody. I did not find the wife to be a credible witness and a further example of this was her allegation that the husband when deployed at sea “would not allot funds from his pay directly to me while he was gone....”.

They were together for eight years, and had two children (ages six and three). The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50). She alleged the husband was abusive. The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children. Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times). The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded. If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that. Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan. Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation. A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance. Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.","HELD: The Court granted shared parenting with the husband. The children were placed in the husband's sole care and custody. The Court found that the wife's allegations of abuse were unfounded. The nature and cause of conflict between the parties was that the husband was abusive of the wife and the children had little face to face communication with the wife. The court found that there was no evidence the wife had actually harmed the children and that the child would not be exposed to the abuse if it were not for the wife’s repeated repeated requests to the husband to provide more time and attention to the children.

At the onset of her trial, the accused took the position that her s. 8, s. 9 and s. 10 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all the evidence obtained after the stop should be excluded. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached. 1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest. 2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there. 3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of drugs contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and operating a vehicle that was in possession of a controlled substance, to wit, cannabis marihuana in an amount exceeding 3 kilograms, for the purposes of trafficking contrary to ss. 249(1)(a) and s. 267(a). The subsequent questions pertaining to the gym bag were improper. At the moment the questions were asked, the officer had not even the slightest suspicion that drugs or alcohol were in the vehicle or in the possession of the accused. The accused's words, actions and manner of driving did not demonstrate any symptoms of impairment. HELD: The evidence was excluded. 1) Given the lessened expectation of privacy in an automobile, police officers are entitled and expected to utilize their senses during the course of their duties. If the aroma of liquor or drug is evident, the question then becomes one of the proper test to determine whether reasonable and probable grounds exist for search. The Court found that the strong odour of raw cannabis in the accused's vehicle combined with the other indicators observed by him provide more than sufficient basis for reasonable grounds either for search or for arrest or for both. 2) The Court held that the evidence obtained after the initial stop should be excluded. 3) There was no quarrel with the visual inspection of the vehicle by police officers. At night the inspection can only be carried out with the aid of a flashlight and it is necessarily incidental to a check stop program carried out after dark. The inspection is essential for the protection of those on duty in the check stops. There have been more than enough incidents of violence to police officers when vehicles have been stopped.

[58] In summary I find that there has been no breach of the appellant’s ss. 8, 9 or 10 Charter rights.",0.38825448613376834,"The accused was charged with two counts of possession of a controlled substance contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and one count of assault with a weapon. The accused had been operating a motor vehicle at night and was attempting to evade a police officer when she noticed that the officer was pursuing her and noticed that there was a red bag in the back seat of the accused's vehicle. When the officer approached the accused, the accused stated that she was under arrest for possession of marijuana and that she wanted to contact a lawyer. The officer told the accused that he had smelled marijuana in the vehicle and that the smell of raw cannabis was strong and that he thought the bag might have dog food in it. The Crown proceeded against the accused on the following counts: 1) The evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed by this Charter. The evidence obtained after the initial stop should be excluded pursuant to ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter. 2) There can be no quarrel with the visual inspection of a vehicle by police officers. At night the inspection can only be carried out with the aid of a flashlight and it is necessarily incidental to a check stop program carried out after dark. The inspection is essential for the protection of those on duty in the check stops. There have been more than enough incidents of violence to police officers when vehicles have been stopped. Nor can place any particular significance upon the fact stressed by the appellant that the police only made use of flashlight after the request had been made of the appellant to produce the necessary papers and not when the constable first approached the car. Although the safety of the police might make it preferable to use the flashlight at the earliest opportunity, it certainly can be utilized at any time as necessary incident to the check stop routine. 3) The accused was in possession of 2,446-day supply or 6.7-year supply. Since the shelf life of cannabis marihuana is six months, under ideal conditions this amount far exceeds what could normally be considered 'personal usage'. The police use of check stops should not be extended beyond these aims.",0.39999999999999997
4_1996canlii6648.txt,The applicant sought to have the law firm barred from acting for the plaintiff because a member of that firm had been active in representing the defendant prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers following a change in government. This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors. The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause. 1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff. This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.  2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern. 4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme.

Much is made by the applicant of the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. By reference to strategy counsel, the applicant seems to suggest that the company has such litigation strategy and internal policies and procedures of confidential nature that is, one which could not be deduced from the pleadings and examinations for discovery by any competent lawyer. Review of the file herein suggests that no such strategy exists. The only identifiable strategy adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications, including this one, to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. In the earlier application, the tendency to use applications of this sort as harassment technique was used.

Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence.

That jurisdiction is derived in the first instance in this case from s63(3). 2)Because the matter is not one of jurisdiction, there is no question in our minds that a party for whose benefit the provisions for service set out in the provisions of the notice of appeal can waive compliance with those provisions. When such waiver occurs, the failure to comply with the provision for service do not constitute bar to the board's hearing the appeal. 3)The appeal is dismissed.","THE COURT: The appeal is dismissed, per reasons for judgment given orally by Chipman, J.A.; Roscoe and Flinn, JJ.A., concurring. [1] This is an appeal by the Director of Assessment from a decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board. [7] We are unanimously of the opinion that this appeal must fail because, although s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act was not complied with respecting service on the Municipality, that party expressly waived its right to notice required by the statute. The appeal is dismissed with costs to each of the respondents, Warren and the Municipality, in the amount of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) plus disbursements to be paid by the appellant.",0.5196374622356495,"The Director of Assessment appealed a decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board, which held that it had no jurisdiction to hear an assessment appeal because the taxpayer failed to serve notice on the clerk of the municipality as required by s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act.

HELD: The Court dismissed the action as the plaintiff did not establish its case on a balance of probabilities.  The Limitations Act applies and the action was barred.

There was no material misrepresentation or fraud or concealment of facts, nor unjust enrichment.","The defendant sold business equipment to the plaintiff in September of 2007. The plaintiff alleged that the equipment sold never worked properly and sought damages for breach of contract and in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation and unjust enrichment. HELD: The Plaintiff had not established any element of its case on a balance of probabilities and the defendant was not in breach of the agreement. The Limitations Act allows an action to be commenced within two years of the claim being discovered.

The conclusion from the evidence was that there was no evidence of fraud or any concealment of facts that would allow the Plaintiff's claim to succeed.

The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga. The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands. The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages. In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act. HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1. As the Provincial Court judge's conclusion was correct, the Court held that the convictions must stand and did not interfere with the fines and surcharges imposed upon the respondents.","The two companies were convicted in Provincial Court of operating a forest products processing facility without a licence contrary to s.18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act.

b_1996canlii6726.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties. The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division. The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens. The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted.

As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours. When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off. The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house. The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD. He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired. He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him. He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples. The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal. The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving. The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes. The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45. An alcohol expert and the accused testified. The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to. The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007. HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence. The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis. The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions. The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping. There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face. The accused was found guilty of the evading charge.",The accused was found not guilty on a charge of driving while his ability to do so was impaired and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08 (under s.253(1)(b)) and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer. HELD: The Court found that the accused was not trying to evade the police officer. The Court accepted the evidence of the Alberta Court of Appeal. The defence provided a credible account of the accused's alcohol consumption. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening and that he had consumed a few beers in the evening and then decided to go for spin. The offence was committed when the accused turned on his emergency lights and the drinking history was different in terms of both the amount of beer and hard liquor consumed and the time the hard liquor was consumed than the history he gave to alcohol expert Mary Ellen Scott.,"[1] Vincent Lehman is charged with driving a vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol (under s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code) and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of .08 (under s. 253(1)(b)) and, lastly, with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer (under s. 249.1(2)), all on August 17, 2013 at Togo. [7] The issues for me to determine are:



(1) Whether there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt Mr. Lehman’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol;

(2) Whether Mr. Lehman’s evidence, together with expert Mary Ellen Scott’s evidence, raises a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle for Cst. Cobbledick; and

(3) Whether Mr. Lehman had a reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the police officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. [28] I am satisfied that Mr. Lehman was drinking alcohol steadily over the hours before he drove, and that this factor, taken together with the time since this day, has effected his recollection of this day and what he drank. As a result, given that finding, where the evidence of Cst. Cobbledick and Mr. Lehman is at odds, I reject the evidence of Mr. Lehman and accept the evidence of Cst. Cobbledick. [29] For the reasons that follow, I am not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of Mr. Lehman’s alcohol consumption this evening and early morning: [30] As I am not satisfied that there was a credible account of Mr. Lehman’s alcohol consumption this evening and early morning, there is not in my view a basis to apply the opinions given by Ms. Scott. As a result, and as I am satisfied that all other prerequisites in s. 258(1)(c) have been proved by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt, I do not have a reasonable doubt that Mr. Lehman’s blood alcohol content was over 80 mg% at the time he got out of his vehicle and approached Cst. Cobbledick. There is no doubt, based on the evidence, that Mr. Lehman knew he was being pursued by a police officer who had engaged his emergency lights for a stop or that Mr. Lehman did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. [33] Considering Mr. Lehman’s evidence, I am not satisfied that he had a reasonable excuse for not stopping. [36] As a result, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Lehman operated a motor vehicle while being pursued by Cst. Cobbledick in his police vehicle, and failed, without a reasonable excuse, and in order to evade Cst. Cobbledick, to stop his vehicle as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances.

Based on the evidence, there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued and that he had engaged his emergency lights for a stop or that he did not stop.

The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping. There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face. The accused was found guilty of the evading charge.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to do so was impaired and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08 and, lastly, with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in the circumstances. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The accused's blood alcohol content was over 80 mg% at the time he got out of his vehicle and approached Cst. Cobbledick. The officer noted approximately ten to twelve beer cans on the coffee table, which got his attention because the accused had told him he had only drank six beer throughout the day. Although the officer did not specifically count the beer cans and put them in his notes, he was adamant that there were more than six beer cans. Based on the evidence, there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued and that he had engaged his emergency lights for a stop or that he did not stop. The only issue was whether the accused was drinking alcohol steadily over the hours before he drove and whether his memory, and/or version of what he drank this evening and night, and when he drank it, has changed over time.","[1] Vincent Lehman is charged with driving a vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol (under s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code) and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of .08 (under s. 253(1)(b)) and, lastly, with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer (under s. 249.1(2)), all on August 17, 2013 at Togo. [7] The issues for me to determine are:



(1) Whether there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt Mr. Lehman’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol;

(2) Whether Mr. Lehman’s evidence, together with expert Mary Ellen Scott’s evidence, raises a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle for Cst. Cobbledick; and

(3) Whether Mr. Lehman had a reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the police officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. [28] I am satisfied that Mr. Lehman was drinking alcohol steadily over the hours before he drove, and that this factor, taken together with the time since this day, has effected his recollection of this day and what he drank. As a result, given that finding, where the evidence of Cst. Cobbledick and Mr. Lehman is at odds, I reject the evidence of Mr. Lehman and accept the evidence of Cst. Cobbledick. [29] For the reasons that follow, I am not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of Mr. Lehman’s alcohol consumption this evening and early morning: [30] As I am not satisfied that there was a credible account of Mr. Lehman’s alcohol consumption this evening and early morning, there is not in my view a basis to apply the opinions given by Ms. Scott. As a result, and as I am satisfied that all other prerequisites in s. 258(1)(c) have been proved by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt, I do not have a reasonable doubt that Mr. Lehman’s blood alcohol content was over 80 mg% at the time he got out of his vehicle and approached Cst. Cobbledick. There is no doubt, based on the evidence, that Mr. Lehman knew he was being pursued by a police officer who had engaged his emergency lights for a stop or that Mr. Lehman did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. [33] Considering Mr. Lehman’s evidence, I am not satisfied that he had a reasonable excuse for not stopping. [36] As a result, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Lehman operated a motor vehicle while being pursued by Cst. Cobbledick in his police vehicle, and failed, without a reasonable excuse, and in order to evade Cst. Cobbledick, to stop his vehicle as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. CONCLUSION [37] For the reasons I have stated, Mr. Lehman is found not guilty on the impaired driving charge (count 1), guilty on the over .08 charge (count 2) and guilty on the flight from police charge (count 3).",0.4246575342465754,"The accused was charged with driving while his ability to do so was impaired and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08 and, lastly, with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in the circumstances.

After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building. Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand. The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged. A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket. Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level. The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall. Accused found guilty on both counts; the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation.

The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with exceeding 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The accused had consumed four or five drinks. There was no other observable sign of impairment. The officer asked the accused to enter the police vehicle where he asked him to provide sample of his breath into an approved screening device. When the accused complied, the instrument registered 'fail'. The accused was arrested for impaired driving. He appealed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge addressed the factors and correctly applied the test. The trial judge did not commit an error of law. The fact that the accused was not given an opportunity to consult counsel of his choice was not a sufficient reason to exclude the certificate of analysis from the search. 2)The officer did not act in haste to obtain the results of the analysis of breath samples of the accused. He did not fail to understand the meaning of s. 10(b) nor did he fail to comprehend that there was evidence to support both findings and there was no error in law.  3)The Court reviewed the facts and circumstances and the law. It found that the trial judge erred in law by excluding evidence pursuant to ss. 24(2) and s. 23(2). The Court found that when the officer misunderstood the name of the lawyer desired and requested by the accused, the result was that the name could not be understood or heard as 'Vagnan'. There really was no similarity between the name and the name. 4)The accused's attitude was not fully comprehended at the time of the search nor did it reduce the officer's power to act in a timely fashion.","[1] In an information dated November 2, 2010, the accused, Kenneth Blair Neff, was charged that on or about the 23rd day of October, A. D. 2010, at Alida, in the Province of Saskatchewan:

1. That the learned trial judge erred in law by holding that the Respondent’s s. 10(b) Charter right was violated. Upon a review of the facts and circumstances and the law, I reject both grounds of appeal. [12] This appeal is brought by the Crown pursuant to ss. 813(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (“Criminal Code”). When that computer search resulted in a large number of names, once again the officer did not turn to the accused in an attempt to reduce the number of names. The trial judge committed no error in so finding and finding a breach of s. 10(b) for there was evidence to support both findings and there was no error of law.

b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","The Director applied for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 (property) to the Crown in Saskatchewan pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act.

Since the plaintiff filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order pursuant to the 2010 Act.

The reality is that the Director commenced proceedings under the 2009 Act thus the Director’s authority to pursue a forfeiture order must be assessed from that perspective alone. Thus, on the unchallenged evidence of Ms. Pryznzk, the only finding of fact which can rationally be made is that Ms. Pryznyk in her capacity as Director was satisfied in August 2016 that the $10,475.00 previously seized by the police constituted proceeds of unlawful activity. [43] The Director’s application is therefore not statute barred and there is no limitations issue. [56] For the reasons given, there is no retroactivity problem. [61] I accept Mr. Henry’s evidence with regard to the significance of these various factors and how they are common to the drug trafficking trade. [70] On a common sense view of the evidence before me, I find it more likely than not the money was proceeds of unlawful activity. [72] Mr. Butler bears the onus of establishing, on a balance of probabilities, that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. CONCLUSION [73] The seized property is proceeds of unlawful activity. The forfeiture order proposed by the Director shall issue.",0.5338208409506399,"This is an application by the Director under the The Seizure of Criminal Property Act for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 to the Crown in Saskatchewan. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from William Ross Butler in 2008. Since Mr. Butler filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for forfeiture order pursuant to Part II. HELD: The application was brought four months later and fell comfortably within the two year limitation window prescribed by s. 35.1. The Director's application is not statute barred and there is no limitations issue. 1) The current legislative mandate reflected in the 2009 Act is prospective in operational effect and not retroactive. 2) There is no retroactivity problem. The facts and circumstances of the seized property are consistent with the purchase and sale of the goods. The date of discovery is irrelevant as is the need for a finding of criminal culpability. 3) The reality is that the Director commenced proceedings under the 2009 act thus the Director's authority to pursue a forfeiture order must be assessed from that perspective alone. The present case boils down to: 1) Whether the property was seized prior to the limitation period expired; and 2) Whether an order granted under this legislation in relation to property seized before this legislation came into force is retroactive in effect. The effect of the legislation is to deny for the future right to deduct enjoyed enjoyed in the past but the right is not affected as a result of the enactment of the amending statute. The legislation is civil not criminal in nature, and it is an in rem remedy.",0.41630276564774377
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT: The father of one child applied to reduce his support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under Archambault J.’s order. HELD: 1) The father was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support. The mother was underemployed and the father had not obtained full-time employment with another employer. The father's decision to work only three months of the year and return to school was not a reasonable decision when he had a continuing obligation to provide support for his child. The court reviewed the father's financial position and found that he had not been successful on this motion. The Court ordered costs as against the father for the additional legal expenses associated with having to submit motions to the court in order to force the father to disclose financial information.  2) On all of the evidence, the father was found to be unemployed. The difficulty in the matter is determining whether or not the father has, indeed, been successful.  3) The court determined that the father is underemmployed. He has not been able to find employment that is reasonable in light of the substantial delays in this proceeding and the fact that his child support application was commenced in June of 2002. It is also clear that the discovery motion which heard in this matter would not have been necessary had the father provided appropriate financial disclosure.","Mr. Pilat applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind arrears which have accumulated under Archambault J.’s order.

Mr. Pilat\'s decision to work only three months of the year and/or return to school is not a reasonable decision when he has a continuing obligation to provide support for his child, Stephanie. Mr. Pilat\'s income is, for the purpose of this application, imputed to be the sum of $40,000.00. Thus, any sharing of s. 7 special expenses should be based on Mr. Pilat\'s imputed income of $40,000.00 and Ms. Lilley\'s income of $39,000.00.

The sentencing judge had this to say in response to the Crown's proposal of a sentence of three to four years: “When a record is reviewed the Crown must be acknowledged that it is possible to change the sentence subject to a change in circumstances. However, the sentence should not have been imposed until after the Crown had finished monitoring the record. 3)The sentence should have been made available sooner. The community's support for the respondent, his education and technical trade training, the fact he spent time in remand, the community’s willingness to cooperate with the Crown and his failure to comply with the terms of his undertaking, fail without lawful excuse to comply and fail without protection of the court order. 4)The sentencing judge acknowledged that the sentence was already in danger of being imposed sooner than it had already been. 5)The community had already made efforts to monitor the sentence and to make sure it was made available to the public sooner. 6)It was obvious that the Crown was aware of the gravity of the sentence.",0.46808510638297873

The plaintiff alleged that it did not proceed with an application at an earlier stage of the proceedings as it wished to provide an opportunity at the pre-trial conference stage for the matter to be resolved. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)There are appropriate circumstances (dismissal) to deny the defendant an order that the plaintiffs post security in the present instance against either or both of the plaintiffs. The fact that it was not made until now would have left the plaintiffs with the distinct possibility that, ultimately, the court was not going to be asked by SaskPower to have them furnish security. 2)Rule 547 is not a code which confines the court's jurisdiction to those areas particularly mentioned in the rule. The common law has not been supplanted entirely by the rule and the court is still permitted to invoke its inherent jurisdiction to regulate its own procedure by ordering security in instances not covered by the Rule. 3)The court has the power to order security in all cases where it is thought just to do so. In the case of a joint claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs which could be awarded to it in the event of successful defence, in excess of $55,000, in circumstances where the plaintiff no longer carried on business and was without assets, the Court is not persuaded that thereby the parties would be more inclined to enter into meaningful settlement discussions as alleged.","[1] The defendant ""SaskPower"" seeks an order pursuant to

HELD: The application was dismissed. The delay was not unreasonable.  1)The 25 months between when the charge was laid in May 1996 and the trial date in November 1998 was sufficiant delay to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the delay. Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest. The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay. His right to security of person and to liberty were not affected. 3)Seven months delay was due to scheduling delays resulting from defence's application to remove prosecution counsel who had previously represented the accused. The Crown acted in good faith in opposing the application and had a meritorious position. 4)All other proceedings were within the systemic guidelines. 5)Prejudice to his liberty was minor as he was on bail since shortly after his arrest. He was able to make full answer and defence. He was employed throughout since his release. His inability to enter long term contracts or travel out of province would have existed for 21-1/2 months of the 25 month delay in any event. 6)Individual and family stress is to be expected.

morphine, contrary to section 4(1) of the Narcotic Control

dismissed. Seven months of the
delay is due to the scheduling delays which occurred as a
result of defence counsel`s application to remove the
prosecution counsel prior to the preliminary hearing (October
27, 1997 - June 2, 1998). Crown. What is known, is the accused`s right to a
fair trial has not been prejudiced by the total time
delay involved. [16] The foregoing points cause me to conclude the Crown
in opposing the application did so in good faith,
and it did have a meritorious position (regardless
of whether it was a winning position) (Vide: R. v.

6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","This appeal concerns the application of s. of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act, RSS 1978, L-16 [LCRA], in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. Hrynewich Holdings dealt with circumstances similar to the case at hand. The appellants fell into default and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. However, these proceeds were not sufficient to satisfy the loan. The respondent then sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Under the provisions of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act the right of a lender to recover the unpaid balance of mortgage securing the purchase price of farmland is restricted to the land to which the mortgage or agreement relates as well as to any collateral security including a guarantee. 2) The respondent bank was found to be the controlling authority in this case. The appellant bank was entitled to take out the deficiency judgment against the mortgage balance.  3) The decision in Andrew (CA) would not have been made had it not been for the appellant bank's decision to apply the proceeds of sale against the balance owing on the purchase money portion of the loan and then pursue Mr. Andrew on his personal liability to pay the non-purchase money portion. 4) The court found that s. 25 of the LCRA should be interpreted liberally thereby permitting the sale proceeds ($372,000.01) to be applied to purchase money debt and (most likely, non-Purchase money) on a pro rata basis to determine the amount of deficiency judgment.  5) The Chambers judge considered s.2 of the ss.25 of the Code and held that the amount owed by the appellants was $162,675. This amount was calculated as follows: $372,582.48. The remaining LCRA protection was $1,066.72. The order below should be varied to entitle the respondent to take into account the balance owed.","Appeal allowed [5] There are two issues to determine: a) how should the proceeds of the sale be applied against the mortgage balance, and b) what is the proper amount of the deficiency judgment? That is, forty-six percent ($105,100) is to be applied to the debt represented by the prior mortgage, and fifty-four percent ($123,400) is to be applied to the remainder. Therefore, the appeal was dismissed. [30] Finally, the decision in Hrynewich Holdings accords with the view of Professor Cuming that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to the purchase money and non-purchase money portions.

The respondent is entitled to take out a deficiency judgment in the amount of $31,160.23 as at March 23, 2016, against the appellants. The appeal will also be allowed to this extent.
