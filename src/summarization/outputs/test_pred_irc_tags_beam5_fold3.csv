1994canlii4187.txt,"The petitioner sought a divorce and maintenance for herself and the couple's five-year old child. The wife was working and earned a modest income; the husband a substantial one. Allowing the application, that although the wife upgraded her education during the marriage with encouragement and financial support from the husband, she was entitled to maintenance for an indefinite period. The court reviewed the means and needs of the parties and awarded spousal in addition to child maintenance. The court recognized the indirect financial consequences to a custodial parent in raising children.","The petitioner sought a divorce from the respondent as well as maintenance for herself and the five-year-old daughter of the marriage. The parties had been married for 10 years and had two children. The husband worked long hours daily for 28 straight days during which he was confined to the oil rig and then had 28 days off. The wife was an innately intelligent and ambitious person. HELD: 1)The petitioner was entitled to maintenance at the rate she was now receiving. 2)The court should recognize the numerous financial consequences to a custodial parent not reflected in the direct cost of supporting a child. The support deadline should not be placed upon her when she has the direct responsibility of raising child and when the availability of more gainful employment within the foreseeable future is uncertain. 3)The respondent was not in issue since the parties entered into an agreement dated June 10, 1994, settling that issue. It is difficult, with any degree of accuracy, to apportion between the petitioner and child an amount of monetary maintenance. As the wife was the sole owner of the shares of the operating company and ran the company with the assistance of her mother, brother and step-father. 4)The husband was obliged to maintain life insurance and an education fund for the petitioner."
1994canlii4796.txt,"The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act. 2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy. The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused. 3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan. 4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer. In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan. There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension.","The applicant sought a declaration under s63 of the Personal Property Security Act that her interest in a group registered retirement savings plan (later defined as the 'Group Plan') was not subject to a security interest she granted to Crown Life. She further sought an order restraining Crown Life from arbitrarily cancelling her participation in the plan. HELD: The application for a restraining order was denied. 1)The provisions of s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act do not apply to the applicant. The loan agreement contains no provision enabling Crown Life to collapse the applicant's account in the Group Plan and thereby create an attachable pension refund. Since the applicant has not retired and no pension refund exists, there appears to be no monetary sum current to set off, unless a proper request for a transfer has been made by her.  2)The applicant's application for restraining order is denied. 3)The loan agreement provides that Crown Life may deduct the respondent's indebtedness from any amounts it may owe her and the proceeds of the account are to be used to purchase a retirement benefit for the annuitant upon her reaching retirement age."
1994canlii5095.txt,"The Director of Labour Standards issued a certificate against the City of Regina certifying that it owed a transit employee $318.41 in wages for hours worked in weeks containing a statutory holiday in excess of 32 hours as provided in the Labour Standards Act. The City applied for a review. HELD: The City's application was allowed. Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question. Pursuant to section 72 of the Act, therefore, these particular terms of the collective agreement applied since they were, when considered in light of the balance of the agreement, more favorable to the employee than the requirements of the Act.","The City applied to review a certificate issued pursuant to s. 60 of the Labour Standards Act declaring that the City of Regina (the ""City"") owed its transit employee $511.08 in wages. At the hearing, the Director filed a letter reducing the assessment to $318.41 (including annual holiday pay). The City brought this application to review the assessment. HELD: 1)By ss. 10(1) and 6(2) of the Act, an employer is required to pay an employee at the rate of time and one-half for every hour worked in excess of 32 hours in any week containing a public holiday. The overtime arises only because there is a holiday in the week in question. The existence of the holiday is an essential part of the issue. No holiday means no issue. 2)The City filed various documents including copies of the collective bargaining agreement it has with the Amalgamated Transit Union, Local #588, which covers Morgan's employment with the City, and asked me to compare the agreement's holiday pay with the Act's. There was some, but not much. 3)The provisions of the agreement should govern, and not those of, the Act. The City's application was allowed and the certificate was amended to show that there were no wages due or payable to the employee during the period December 31, 1989 to January 2, 1993. 4)The agreement's provisions governing pay for holidays were more favourable than those in the Act and for each of the specific weeks questioned by the Director it paid the employee 4 hours overtime."
1995canlii4337.txt,"This was an appeal from the decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board allowing an appeal from the decision of the Victims' Services Division denying compensation to the respondent on the basis the police had not proceeded with criminal charges for an assault which had occurred. Dismissing the appeal, that the Board had correctly interpreted its jurisdiction and made findings amply supported by the evidence arising from the de novo hearing. Failure of the police to lay a charge against the attacker did not disqualify the applicant from compensation if it was otherwise supported by the evidence.","The appellant applied for criminal injuries compensation pursuant to the Victims' Rights and Services Act. He alleged that he was wrongly assaulted and as result he was entitled to compensation for the losses he suffered. The police investigation indicated that they would not be proceeding with criminal charges. Because the program was unable to confirm through the criminal justice system that the appellant was a victim of crime, we were unable to make a compensation award. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the Board correctly interpreted its jurisdiction and made findings of fact that were within its jurisdiction."
1996canlii6881.txt,"FIAT. The parties were divorced in 1995 and all issues including spousal maintenance were left in abeyance. The petitioner had agreed to pay $3,000 per month which included child support but the support was reduced to $1,000 and was irregular and late. The two children were living with the petitioner and although old enough to hold jobs, had been unable to find employment. The petitioner's income exceeded $80,000 annually but he had been suspended with pay and the status of his employment was uncertain. HELD: 1)It was premature to fix the amount of spousal maintenance as asked for by the applicant. There were too many unknowns including the future of the petitioner's future job and income and how much the applicant would require should she go to university in the fall and what the children would do about future education. 2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the maintenance. 3)The petitioner was directed to pay $1,500 plus $200.00 per month until the shortfall was paid in full.  4)The applicant was awarded costs of the application.","FIAT. The parties separated in the summer of 1994. All other issues raised in the divorce proceeding were left in the husband's favour. The petitioner reduced the monthly support to $1,000 per month and even those payments had been irregular and not on time. The husband applied for interim spousal maintenance at the suggested guideline figure. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The uncertainty of the petitioner's future job and income was not a factor to be considered. 2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the $1500.00 maintenance he consistently paid up to December 1995 to $2,000 as noted above without at least consulting with the applicant. Had these payments continued the applicant would have recovered $6,000. 3)The court found that there were too many unknown factors surrounding the future situation of either party to conclude that what the applicant asks for is fair and reasonable."
1997canlii787.txt,"After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, the plaintiff, a supplier of materials to the sub-contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub-contractor. The Bond contained a provision limiting the liability of the surety and the principal to make payment to any claimant not having a contract directly with the principal. Dismissing the action with costs, that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier. With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work. As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff. Therefore, the supplier was not entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond.","After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, a supplier of materials to the sub contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a Labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the subcontractor. HELD: The claims of the plaintiff against the defendants were dismissed. 1)The Mechanics' Lien Act does not expressly state that it binds the Crown. However, the plaintiff found no intention to contract, no valuable consideration, and no promise to pay. 2)If the Mechanics' lien Act had been applicable, the applicant would not have been entitled to recover anything due to the third party statutory liens. 3)The plaintiff would pay the costs of Rideau Construction and London Guarantee which, because they are represented by the same counsel, will be single amount as may be agreed upon between counsel or, if agreement is not possible, set by the Court at the time an Order for Judgment is taken out."
1999canlii12427.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching contrary to s.271(1) and 153 of the Criminal Code. The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor. The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused often slept on the couch in the basement of the house adjacent to the room where the family watched TV. There was a couch or love-seat in that room. The accused sometimes slept down there because he was angry with the complainant's mother for not wanting to have sex with him. When the behaviour finally escalated to groping at her in the bedroom while she was sleeping, she called the police. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both charges. 1)The evidence was circumstantial. The complainant had the time in the sense that the complainant went to bed late in the evening or in the early morning hours at time when most of the household would be asleep. There were also four occasions when the accused walked into her room (he said he thought she was awake) and ran out. He said that he was chasing kittens. That explanation sounded too contrived. No one had mentioned cats or kittens before. 2)The accused had the opportunity to sleep downstairs about two-thirds of the time. However, he also had the chance to sleep in the living room with his mother. The mother testified that she never had any concerns about the accused and his behaviour toward her daughter. The only concerns she had were depression or withdrawal and her sliding school performance, anger and self consciousness. 3)There was no threat to the complainant or to herself or to anyone else. The assault was escalating and the accused had a pattern of intrusive behaviour that escalated over the course of several years. The alleged incidents were consistent with the accused’s repeated repeated assaults on the complainant and his repeated threats to leave and take her baby brother with him, which would have alerted her mother if he got off on his own. Although he was severely drunk, she could only recall only one other time when he was that drunk. She said that it was rare for him to be drunk. Alcohol was not problem. It was only after the complainant called the Police that she was able to report the assault to the RCMP. She testified that he only touched the complainant when she was reaching for something above the stove and began to fall. He always used one hand. The touching only lasted seconds each time ending as soon as she said stop."

The respondent has costs at double Column V. The considerations to be applied in a leave to appeal application is 1)whether the issue raised by the proposed appeal is sufficiently important to the litigation before the Court or to the practice in general to warrant consideration by the Court of Appeal. 2)Whether the applicant's proposed submission to the Court of Appeal has sufficient merit to warrant the granting of leave. 3)Whether there is any delay in the proceedings which would be caused by the interjection of an appeal.

2001skqb485.txt,"The accused was charged with ten counts including robbery, aggravated assault, assault causing bodily harm, possession of stolen property and trafficking in narcotics. She raised s.9 and 8 of the Charter in objecting to the arrest and seizure of the duffel bag. The voir dire occupied 5 days. HELD: 1)The four requirements set out in R. v. Feeney for a warrantless search were satisfied. The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the duffel bag was incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. 2)The accused had no expectation of privacy with respect to either her friend's residence or the bag. The decision in R. v. Edwards was squarely on point. There was no evidence tying the accused to the gym bag. It was of a different description than the one used in the drugstore robbery. The accused never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it. The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence. 3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter. To exclude the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with 10 counts of robbery, aggravated assault, assault causing bodily harm, possession of stolen property, and trafficking in narcotics.

The debtor made a consumer proposal which was accepted by his creditors and PricewaterhouseCoopers was appointed Trustee under the proposal. At some point during the proposal Mr. White defaulted and defaulted.

Ace was also a client of defence counsel and so defence counsel would not be able to cross-examine Ace. HELD: The Crown failed to provide proper disclosure to defence counsel, the non-disclosure had an adverse effect of the accused's ability to make full answer in defence and the appropriate remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call Ace as a witness.","The accused is charged with break and enters of homes. He pleaded guilty to three of them but denied involvement. After hearing evidence from the home owners, co-accused, and peace officers who investigated the incidents, the Crown advised the court of its intention to call one of the accused to the witness box. He had been subpoenaed by the Crown and, unknown to the prosecution, had been sitting in court listening to the other Crown witnesses. Defence counsel objected on this basis but Defence counsel argued that if the Crown had informed the defence that it would call this witness, the defence would not be able to cross-examine him effectively or at all. HELD: The accused's right to full answer and defence has been prejudiced only by not being told that Ace Carlos Whitecap would be a Crown witness. 1)The defence has met this test. The prejudice to the accused's rights to make full answer, defence flows from not being informed that the accused would be called. 2)The accused was disadvantaged in his ability to make his defence on the basis of the witnesses the Crown is actually going to call. The defence had met the test. 3)There was no prejudicial effect on the defence on a balance of probabilities. The accused was advantaged in the fact that he was a client of the Crown's lawyer. 4)The Crown had not disclosed that it intended to call Whitecap as a witness and that they should not be permitted to do so. It was also disadvantageous in that the defence counsel would then have been able to take the appropriate steps to protect the interests of both the accused and his client. 5)The Court was left with the option of refusing to allow the Crown to call the witness.

2005nssc364.txt,"The Agency applied for permanent care of a young child, with no access to the parents. Each of the mother, the biological father and the psychological father sought to have the child placed in their care. The child had been apprehended due to unsafe and unhealthy living conditions. The mother and psychological father no longer lived together and for the past few months, the mother had been maintaining a clean and tidy apartment and attempting to improve her education and had taken parenting courses. The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child. The mother was against this plan. The biological father only reappeared on the scene after the child was taken into care and acknowledged that the child did not know him as her father.

Defence now wants further disclosure of the number of stops of out-of-province vehicles made by Constable Chornecki in each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004.

2006nssc139.txt,"The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage. The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment. The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child. The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home. Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity. The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.",HELD: The Court granted the divorce in accordance with s. 8(1)(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. It deferred the issue of custody and access while they attempted to work out transitional issues with Doctor Landry. There were significant changes in the circumstances of the parties. The parties entered into a separation agreement which purported to settle all matters between the parties and was to be incorporated into and form part of the Corollary Relief Judgement in this matter. The agreement clearly favoured the mother.

With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1) The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum. The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'. This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support. The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist. 2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program. Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year. The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006. It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000.

The agreement provided that the parties would pay one half of the net income to the petitioner by way of equal monthly payments of support. The respondent was employed with an annual salary of $100,000. The petitioner claimed material change in circumstance due to the loss of his trucking business. HELD: The petitioner was entitled to support under the agreement and the circumstances as they presently existed. 1)The agreement does not contemplate a variation of the spousals support obligation in the event of a material change. 2)The respondent was to pay $65,000 per annum in the amount of $741 per month for the support of their two children. The amount payable shall be reduced in an amount equal to 40% of the petitioner's income that she has earned. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference in paragraphs 7.3 and 7.5 to adjustments which will consider likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government. 3)There were no circumstances in this case that elevate it to one of those 'rare cases' where the parties reached their agreement at a pre-trial conference where they were both represented by counsel and the agreement was in substantial compliance with the objectives of the Divorce Act. It was not feasible to apply Miglin, supra, analysis. 4)The petitioner is entitled to financial assistance under the terms of the agreement. It is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim support.  5)While the parties had signed a comprehensive agreement which dealt with parenting issues, child support, child care and the division of family property, the agreement recognized that there were risks that the respondent's contract may not be renewed and on the principles set forth in Miglin v. Miglin (2003 SCJ 21). The parties agreed that the petitioner would receive all of her net income and then apply the provisions of their interspouseal contract to determine quantum.  6)It is not possible to extrapolate net income from the parties' previous agreement to reflect the projected future earnings. If this Court was to award interim support to Ms. Palmer it would be difficult to apply the Miglin analysis. If the court finds that the agreement should be set aside, they have the power to make a retroactive spousAL support order."
2007skqb376.txt,"The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated. The application is dismissed.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances of the child and that as no material change had been demonstrated, the application must be dismissed. There was no order as to costs."

There is conflicting information about the nature and extent of the petitioner father's parenting duties. The respondent has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child go with her. The petitioner would like Kaira to remain in Saskatchewan and have regular contact with each parent on alternating weeks. HELD: 1) The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The Court cannot determine on conflicting affidavits what the primary parent status quo is. 2) It is in the best interest that the child see both parents. There was a similar course in Saskatoon that the respondent could have taken which would have made more frequent changes possible, but her affidavit indicates she thinks the Saskatoon course is inferior to the one she is taking in Victoria. 3) Pending trial the child shall be parented by the petitioner for 28 days, and thereafter by the respondent for 28 days and such parenting shall continue to alternate for each 28 day period thereafter until further order.

There is conflicting affidavit evidence respecting the nature and extent of the father's parenting duties while the parties lived together. The residence status quo in this case is Regina and the primary parent will reside in Regina pending trial. HELD: 1) There was no compelling reason to allow mobility in the case merely because the mother has made some unilateral decisions about her education. 2) Regina would be the permanent residence of the child pending trial, pending which the primary and secondary parent status quo would be determined. 3) Lesly has chosen to take school in Victoria but that does not mean even if Lesly is the first parent that the child has a strong bond with Mike and his family. The child has strong support network is in Regina and not in Victoria. 4) There will be a trial respecting the status quo and the attachment the child had with the primary parents and that is Lesly.

2009skqb445.txt,"The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances. The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1) There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence. In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos. The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","The accused is facing a 24-count indictment generally associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances and matters ancillary thereto. This motion, under ss.7, 11(d) and 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, is for an order that the accused be provided with full disclosure in useable format. The motion has two separate components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, “the usable format”. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence have been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the accused’s right of reply and defence.

2009skqb506.txt,"The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession. The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person. The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","The appellant appeals from a decision of the Office of Residential Tenancies, dated August 27, 2009. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Act applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. 2) The Hearing Officer did not err in law in finding that there was no valid tenancy agreement between the appellant and the landlord. The appellant sought an order of possession pursuant to s. 70 of the Residential Tenancy Act, 2006 of the rental unit based on the appellant having disputed the termination notice.  3) The appellant was properly served with the Notice of Hearing as it has come to the attention of the Landlord. The Landlord was not present. The hearing officer was satisfied that the non-payment of rent relates to amounts that are the result of an increase to the rent. The landlord increased the rent for the purpose of enabling the landlord to end the tenancy. 4) The appeal was dismissed on the basis that the Hearing Officer erred in law by declaring that she did not have jurisdiction to deal with the matter.  5) The Court found that the tenancy agreement was not valid and the appellant was not prejudiced by any error or omission in the written agreement mentioned in subclause (i). 6) The tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. The Court held that the landlord was estopped from denying the fact of the third person's agency by serving notice to vacate."
2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that because he was a step-parent to the petitioner, he did not need to establish that he falls within the category of persons having a'sufficient interest' to bring this application."
2011nssc455.txt,"The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases which, if granted, would require three separate trials in all. HELD: The application for severance was dismissed on both the bases proposed. 1)The Court must engage in weighing exercise of all the relevant factors in deciding whether to sever or not. 2)The interests of justice encompass the accused's right to be tried on the evidence admissible against him, as well as society's interest in seeing that justice is done in reasonably efficient and cost-effective manner. 3)The accused's testimonial intention should be objectively justifiable. This requirement is balanced with all the others. It can be counterbalanced by other circumstances that the judge finds may prevent the accused from testifying or be outweighed by factors that demonstrate that justice requires a joint trial."
2_1999canlii12669.txt,"The respondent seeks an order for interim spousal support. The parties were married in January 1991 with three children and ceased to cohabit in December of 1996. The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT. The respondent sought an order for interim spousal support. HELD: The Court concluded that relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should not take the form of child support. The petitioner did not have the means to make the indicated payments. There was another source of revenue and that was the farm land which was rented out. The husband had de facto possession of the land and received the entire rental. The difference in value relates to certain farmland which the respondent brought into the marriage. The amount of $2,292.58 is the result of an arbitrary and artificial attribution. On the basis of the respondent's income the children are adequately provided for. The court found that there was sufficient total means to enable the petitioner and the children to enjoy a reasonable standard of living and the respondent to enjoy an improved standard. The latter can be achieved by providing to the respondent some of the income earned from his land."

He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.

In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary. A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48. In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided. Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference. There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case. The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short. While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance.

The court found that although the delay in advancing the action was inordinate, nevertheless the prejudice suffered by the defendant did not reach the level of'serious prejudice' having regard to the factors considered as listed in the ICC case.  1)The plaintiff had not established that the delay was excusable. 2)It was in the interests of justice to grant the plaintiff its costs on party/party basis. The costs awarded were pursuant to Column of this Court's tariff of costs and must be paid within 30 days.

2_2011nssc486.txt,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","Family Law, Divorce Act, Shared parenting, Federal child support guidelines, Spousal Support Legislation: Section of the Federal Child Support Guidelines was considered and the set-off was appropriate. Almost of the Father's pension benefits were earned before the parties marriage. The conflict between the parties had ceased, or at least been substantially reduced, and the mother's present partner was providing greater financial assistance than may initially be assumed. Given that the Father will be paying the proportionally greater share of this expense, the information provided by the Mother and her witnesses in respect to the serious and damaging allegations she has made is credible. The court retains the discretion to modify the set off amount where, considering the children's needs, it would lead to a significant variation in the standard of living experienced by the children as they move from one household to another."
2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. Defence counsel submits the order should not be made as the predicate offence is not a serious personal injury offence and it is not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a danger offender. HELD: The accused was convicted of assaulting a peace officer. He was sentenced to two years in prison. The court found that given the accused’s extensive criminal record and the fact that he had 67 prior convictions, four of them violent, and was on parole for robbery at the time he assaulted police officer, he was “there is no doubt that if struck in the head with this object, it could cause serious damage”."

It normally includes all of the defences which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 2)The Court was unable to say that the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor could it say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.","The accused was charged with an impaired driving offence. He attended court and indicated he would be retaining a lawyer. The judge set a return date and informed the accused he must appear personally because the Crown was proceeding by indictment.

HELD: The appeal was allowed on appeal. 1)The trial judge rejected the accused's submission that he had a lawful excuse for not attending court. 2)The accused's feelings were further bruised by the fact that the original impaired driving charge was eventually stayed by the Crown. In her reasoned decision, the trial judge dismissed the defence of the accused\'s failure to attend court. 3)The issue of lawful excuse was not challenged on appeal as it could be expanded to provide new excuses or excuses specific to a particular offence, or by narrowing it to include only certain excuses."
3_1997canlii11217.txt,"Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them. The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996. The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions.","The Petitioners were three brothers from the District of Perdue, Saskatchewan who carried on a family farm operation and who operated a farm implement dealership business. In 1985, the accountant for the respondent advised the brothers that they should become involved in certain real estate partnerships, in order to derive certain tax advantages. The Petitioners applied for a receiving order against the respondent. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)The petitioner was indebted to the petitioner in the amounts claimed.  2)He had ceased to meet his liabilities generally as they become due. 3)There was no extenuating circumstances which would warrant the Court to refuse to grant the receiving order. 4)As the petitioner is a wealthy individual who is quite capable of paying his debts but has simply chosen not to do so."

3_2001skqb347.txt,An application for certiorari and mandamus. In issue is whether the Youth Court judge has the discretion to refuse to appoint counsel to represent a young person having regard to the provisions of s.11(4) of the Young Offenders Act. The meaning of the word 'unable' in s.11(4)(b) was in issue. The youth was facing a variety of charges including failure to comply with conditions of an undertaking; failure to attend court; possession of property obtained by crime; obstructing a police officer. He requested the Youth Court appoint counsel after his Legal Aid lawyer withdrew. Both parents were on social assistance. The matter was adjourned to investigate the possibility of an aunt providing financial assistance but the youth advised in April that she was unable to do so. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Youth Court judge did not err in refusing to direct counsel be appointed. The Youth Court judge's discretion is not limited solely to considerations of financial inability. The youth disentitled himself to continued Legal Aid representation by his own misconduct.,An application for orders of certiorari and mandamus concerning a decision of a Youth Court judge not to appoint counsel to represent a young person. The issue is whether the Court has discretion to refuse having regard to s. 11(4)(b) of the Young Offenders Act. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1)The Youth Court's discretion to determine inability is not limited solely to considerations of financial inability. In R. v. J.H. the young person refused to be represented by legal aid counsel and applied for court appointed counsel of his own choice. He argued he ought to be able to discharge his counsel without disclosing any reasons. 2)The youth court judge did not err in refusing to direct that the applicant have counsel appointed to him.

3_2002skca56.txt,"A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users. A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services). The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order. It retained jurisdiction to confirm compliance. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date.","The appellant appeals a decision confirming the second decision of a Board of Inquiry appointed by the Minister of Justice under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) which found that the appellant continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services to wheelchair users and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet accessibility requirements of the National Building Code. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with cost on double Column V. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order, an order in which it had retained jurisdiction, to confirm compliance with the order and which had been confirmed by the Court of Appeal. The extent of the order, that is whether it was confined to the external access of the property or to other 'facilities and services' and whether it had been complied with is the very question the Board reserved jurisdiction to determine."
3_2003canlii64101.txt,"The mother moved for the dismissal of the pending permanent care trial, arguing that, applying the reasoning in a recent Court of Appeal decision, the court had lost jurisdiction. No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties. The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel. Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed. The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial. When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act. When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date.","The mother sought a dismissal of a motion under the Children and Family Services Act by which she asked for a dismissal on the basis that the trial date was after the outside disposition date provided in the Act. The Court of Appeal issued a decision in October 2003 referred to as Nova Scotia (Minister of Community Service) v. B.F. at 2003 NSCA 119 which confirmed the trial judge had not lost jurisdiction despite the fact that the agency was moving toward a hearing which was designed to decide the overall best interests of the child and therefore the type of disposition order that should best protect the child. HELD: The Court has not lost its jurisdiction in this matter and the trial will commence tomorrow. 1)When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for a rushed trial date. There may be need for the preparation of expert reports and other trial preparation and to ascertain whether ongoing further services would have resolved the problem. 2)There was good reason for the Court to be faced with the dilemma of either taking the drastic step of an immediate reapprehension and consolidation of the various initial proceedings from interim hearing through protection finding and then to disposition in order to preserve the existing trial dates. In the H.W. decision the proceeding had been approaching the first disposition deadline under section 41(1) of the Act and the agency planning for the reunification of the mother and child required some psychological counselling for the mother. She made a number of changes in the counselling providers over a period of time. The agency had not yet been able to offer the needed protection and pursue the primary and ultimate goal of reunification with the parents. 3)Reapprehension will expose the child to the very delay the deadlines are designed to avoid since each of the stages set out in the act (interim hearing, protection finding, at least one disposition hearing) will run their course in the absence of consent to consolidation under s40(2)of the act. If time line extensions can never be given in those rare cases, the Court has only one remedy and it is very rough one, not always the best one. 4)The Court can only order the agency to reapprehend. Although protection concerns may have been insufficient to justify an order for permanent care, they nonetheless may require intervention by the court."

The accused admitted to consuming one vodka cooler before driving but argued the signs of impairment were manifestations of his panic attack. No .08 charge was laid, as his readings were .07 and .06. HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack. The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As stated in McCallum, the fact that the effects of alcohol may have been exacerbated by the accused suffering from fatigue does not provide a defence to the charge.",The accused was charged with having the care or control of a motor vehicle while his ability to operate a vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs. HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the signs and symptoms of impairment displayed by the accused were the result of a panic attack not from the consumption of alcohol. The Court found that evidence of impairment did not raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.

His students helped him to the faculty lounge. He was found in the faculty washroom unconscious and not breathing approximately 30 minutes later. Emergency medical technicians were not able to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead at the Royal University Hospital. An application for dependants' benefits was submitted over 3 years later. The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim. The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674. HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption. 2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant. 3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing. 4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis.","HELD: The application for dependants' benefits was denied. Ultimately, an application for benefits was submitted to the Saskatchewan Workers' Compensation Board by a representative on behalf of the applicant. The applicant had become aware of the potential rights in early July 2001 during a casual conversation at her workplace. It was suggested to her that because her husband was performing work duties at the University of Saskatchewan, and not while he was on campus to attend class or to study, there might be an entitlement to benefits. The respondent Board did not notify the Workers’ Compensation Board regarding his death. The Board considered the privative clause found in s. 22 of the Act and determined that the standard of review will generally be one of patent unreasonableness. This was not the case when the tribunal had made an error in the interpretation of the legislative provision limiting the tribunal’s powers."
4_1994canlii5048.txt,"The Crown elected to proceed summarily and the accused entered a plea of guilty to a charge of assault under S.266 of the Code. He was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment, 18 months probation and a 10 year fire arm prohibition was imposed. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)Because the accused had no related record and given the circumstances of the assault, the sentence of imprisonment was reduced to time already served (15 days). 2)The trial judge erred in imposing the 10 year fire arm prohibition under S.100 of the Code. S.100 requires a conviction on an indictable offence involving violence against a person where the maximum sentence available is 10 years imprisonment or more. 3)The maximum sentence for assault under S.266 is 5 years if the Crown proceeds by indictment and 6 months if, as here, the Crown proceeds summarily.","The accused was convicted of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to a term of 6 months imprisonment and to enter into a probation order for 18 months on certain specific conditions.

The accused appealed the sentence and reduced the term of imprisonment imposed at trial from 6 months to ""time served"" and maintained the 18 month probation order subject only to amending the time within which the appellant was to report to the chief probation officer as therein provided. HELD: The appeal was allowed and it was set aside. 1)The sentencing principles of protection of society,punishment, general and specific deterrence, reformation and rehabilitation and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice were applied. 2)The sentence imposed was too severe and the appellant had now served 15 days of the sentence. The sentence imposed ought to be reduced to time already served.  3)The appellant was immediately taken into custody. He commenced serving his sentence on August 18, 1994.

When the evidence concluded but before heard argument, issued the following fiat: Order that there be nothing removed from the matrimononial home or any other assets disposed of until further ordered. HELD: The motion was granted.  1)The Court was left with no alternative but to assist the petitioner in regaining the assets taken out of the house by granting an order pursuant to Rule 344 of the Queen's Bench Rules prohibiting the respondent from disposing of any of the assets that the petitioner alleged she found missing when she took possession of the home on December 26, 1993. 2)The respondent was ordered to return the 'list of items' referred to above forthwith.

HELD: Appeal dismissed and conviction accordingly affirmed.  1)Great deference to findings of credibility made at trial should be shown. 2)The trial judge did not say that he found the accused guilty only upon the credibility of the complainant and the accused. He said that he found the Crown's evidence to be credible, and the accused's evidence not to be credible. The Crown's evidence was comprised of both the complainant and the witness. 3)The trial judge's findings are supported by the evidence and his conclusions are not clearly wrong so as to make the conviction unreasonable.","The appellant was convicted of assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.

4_2007skqb438.txt,"The parties have two children, a son born March 1990 and a daughter December 1991. A trial on the issues of the son's residence in 2006, the parties' income for the purposes of child support and any s. 7 expenses was held. HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son. This is a period of no more than 5 months. Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.  2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629. The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3) The parties have been divorced since 1998. The son has played baseball since 2004. The daughter has speed skated since 2001. The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father. It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years. The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription. The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%. Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5) Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794. His income is considerably higher now. His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","The respondent father applied to vary an order made May 14, 2002 by Justice M.E. Wright. The order provided for child support payable to the petitioner mother on behalf of the two youngest children, Michael, born March 15, 1990, and Jessica, born December 30, 1991. The parties divorced in 1998. The father decided to move from the west side of Saskatoon to a larger, more expensive apartment in order to accommodate what he understood to be Michael's interest in moving in with him and Jerrilyn, his older sister. Michael began living with his father at least 40% of the time in September 2006. This ended in January or February 2007, which is a period of no more than 5 months. HELD: 1) The parties are responsible for their proportionate share of expenses according to their income. While it is not necessary that there be in all circumstances written or oral, the father's share is 80% of that amount, or $3,408.80, for the s. 7 expenses until further order, or for as long as Michael and Jessica remain children within the meaning of the Act. 2) It is not practical to order the mother produce receipts for reimbursement from the father."
4_2007skqb51.txt,"FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","FIAT: 1) The respondent applied for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s.7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, being October 2005. The petitioner, Evan Gavelin, requested joint custody with specified access. While he acknowledges an obligation to pay child support and there is an issue as to his income and whether the interim order should be made retroactive, there is no evidence a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 1, 2006 is warranted.  2) The parties' verbal agreement at the time of separation was that the petitioner would have the children during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday during which time he would be responsible for arranging pickup and return of the children. The verbal agreement did not address the fact the petitioner had not received any income from the company prior to that date. 3) The petitioner did not make any child support payments prior to the separation. 4) Retroactive child support should be based on the petitioner's 2004 income as that was the basis for the original October 2005 agreement. 5) The Court was not prepared, on an interim basis, to deduct the $9,600 from the petitioner’s 2006 income."
4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The accused pled guilty at the opening of trial to distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years. A conditional sentence would not be strong enough to deter others who might be inclined to engage in the activity of distributing child pornography.  1)The accused had no criminal record and did not plead guilty. The fact that he disclosed his stories were largely fantasies is not a mitigating factor that detracts from the effects such written pornography has, as set out above. 2)The Court considered the mitigating factors referred to by the defence in the pre-sentence report as mitigating factors. 3)It was appropriate to make an order requiring you to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, 2004, for a period of 20 years, as well as the additional orders."
4_2009skca102.txt,"The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","The respondent pled guilty to manslaughter arising out of the fatal injuries she inflicted on her seven-month-old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: The appeal should be allowed on the basis of this latter ground.  1) The essential facts are not in dispute. The respondent's acknowledgment of responsibility, her expressions of remorse, her abusive background which may have caused symptoms of PTSD, and her socioeconomic situation all contribute to the offence. 2) The respondent had a history of drug use, domestic abuse, domestic violence, and mental health problems. Her previous criminal record was not of character which interfered with her ability to appreciate her surroundings, control her actions or understand the consequences of them. 3) There are many different combinations of subjective and objective culpability which are possible."

The declaration was explicitly made on the assumption that the loans would not be secured against the defendants' existing assets. Later, the defendants' counsel wrote to the court essentially indicating he could not confirm the loans would not be secured against any assets. The court issued this supplemental decision. In the absence of any evidence the loans will not be secured against assets already subject to the execution order, or will not otherwise reduce those assets, the order and declaration sought can no longer be granted.","The defendants sought an order confirming their ability to pay certain amounts for billed and unbilled time without such payments violating the terms of two execution orders previously issued February 18, 2010, as Hfx No. 190408 against the defendants judgment debtors to the plaintiff herein, who were successful litigants in this action. HELD: The Court was unable to grant the proposed order. It was not my intention in my submissions to expand on the evidence otherwise before the Court in Ms. Cochrane's affidavit concerning the third party loans. The affidavit evidence did not reveal where the loans come from or if they will reduce the exigent assets of the defendants, available for execution."
4_2015skca111.txt,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","This is an appeal from the decision of Turcotte J. on October 16, 2014, ordering Daniel Prescesky to pay retroactive child support to his former wife in the amount of $21,645 and costs of $1,500. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The courts draw a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. 2)The Court of Queen's Bench has over the past 10 years been confronted by similar arguments as those being made by the Prescesks and Lantz on this appeal. 3)It is important not to confuse these lines of authority. Procknow is good law, but it relies on common law principles and does not necessarily apply to child support orders. Whether the Court can vary an interim or a final order is governed by the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, c 3 (2d Supp). 4)Section 15.1 and 17 confer the jurisdiction to make and vary child support on the court of Queen’s Bench in this province. For clarity, the court referred to Gaspers Gaspers’ 2007 SKQB 353 (CanLII) at paras 10 and 13. Given the wording of the 2006 Consent Child Support Order, which does not direct that an adjustment should be made as of a particular date, that issue does not arise in this appeal, nor do think it is necessary to do so."

The Plaintiff called several expert witnesses who testified that, in their opinion, the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire. Ford called one witness who was the designer of of the truck's fuel system and a Ford employee. He testified that the defective fuel line could not have leaked sufficient fuel to cause the fire. He also admitted, however, that his prior written report contained errors. Rebuttal evidence called by the Plaintiff indicated that the check valve in the fuel pump designed to prevent siphoning from the fuel tank in the event of a leaking fuel line did not operate as the Ford witness had testified. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff had proved on a balance of probabilities that the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire. The Plaintiff's experts' evidence was accepted over that of the Ford expert. No independent experts had been called by Ford.","The plaintiffs claim for damages from a fire in their garage which they allege was caused by combustion of vapours from a faulty fuel tube in a truck they purchased from Ford. HELD: The action was discontinued. 1)The plaintiffs' theory as to how the fire started was proven beyond a balance of probabilities. The plaintiffs had proven that an electric static discharge through the U-shaped fuel tube was responsible for the cause of the fire. 2)The plaintiff had not driven the truck for two days. During this static discharge, pin holes would be created and gasoline would leak out. There would be a flashback to the area underneath the Ford truck where the gasoline was pooled. 3)The defendant had not called any independent witnesses on their behalf and their only witness was an employee of Ford. 4)The court accepted the expert testimony of the plaintiffs and their expert witness in preference to the defendant."
5_1995canlii4187.txt,"This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).","This was an appeal from a conviction for break, enter and theft contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. A motorist saw the vehicle being driven from the lot at 12:15 o'clock in the morning. He informed the police who, upon finding the office had been broken into and the keys were missing, took chase. Two constables followed the tracks of the vehicle through wooded area. The accused ran from the vehicle and made the tracks in the snow which were followed by the police. The police said the imprint from his footwear resembled the imprint found in the tracks they followed through the snow. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the doctrine of recent possession may be succinctly stated in the following terms. Upon proof of the unexplained possession of recently stolen property, the trier of fact may but not must draw an inference of guilt of theft or of offences incidental thereto. Where the circumstances are such that a question could arise as to whether the accused was thief or merely possessor, it will be for the appellant upon consideration of all the circumstances to decide which inference should be drawn."
5_1998canlii13955.txt,"An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits. The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","The respondent Saskatchewan Government Insurance applied to the court pursuant to s. 197 of the Act for an order setting aside the termination of benefits. The applicant had received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis that he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: The application was set aside. The court found that SGI was not entitled to terminate the applicant's benefits under s. 185(d), (e), (f) or (g) of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.  1)SGI could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy in Yorkton if he was receiving a full, rather than partial, benefit. 2)The applicant's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in his being unable to perform farm duties and he was currently unable to hold the employment that he held at the time of the accident. SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to the applicant prior to October 1 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 24 were significant factors that contributed to Sawkiw's desperate circumstances in October 1997 and resulting conduct in October and thereafter. 3)The application for review was dismissed.

5_2001skqb463.txt,"This judgment applies to both QBG No. 1040/98 and QBG No. 1041/98 respecting the contract between the city and Triple P Holdings and the January 21, 1997 contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required. The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.",HELD: Each case was dismissed. The plaintiffs had failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged on that breach and that any breach occurred. The issue of privity of contract could have been a critical issue in different circumstances but in the end this case will not turn on the issue. 1)The plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the City of Regina. The general thrust of all of the evidence was that certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to the members of the Independent Truckers Association. The defendants made some effort to include the plaintiffs in the rotation but there was no contractual obligation in the agreement which required the defendants to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work and the contract between the defendants and the city of Regina is not incorporated by a specific or general reference. 2)The issue was not the only one to be dealt with. 3)Each case is dismissed.

The only material difference in testimonies was whether there was a half-ton truck in front of the plaintiff's vehicle when the collision occurred. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was not proven on a balance of probabilities. The physical evidence did not assist and the court was unable to conclude that one version was correct and the other incorrect.,This was an action in negligence arising out of a vehicle accident which occurred at a location where a tractor trailer slowly inched up to a Honda Corrolla operated by the plaintiff and nudged it causing damage to the back bumper of the plaintiff's vehicle and some denting on the trunk lid of the vehicle.

HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.  1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons. 2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand. Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement. 3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant. The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing. Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing.","FIAT.

The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company. The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action. The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","The appellants sought an order permitting them to withdraw the admissions and to add a claim for an “oppression remedy” to the defendant’s counterclaim for alleged misdeeds of the plaintiff.

The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled. Application for summary judgment granted; the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success. The plaintiff cannot resist a summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff's credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge.","The plaintiff was driving from Halifax to Seabright when a tractor-trailer passed her vehicle. She alleged that a piece of metal fell off of his vehicle, bounced on to the engine bonnet of her vehicle and hit her windshield. She claimed damages for injuries to her arms, shoulders and neck.

The experts' reports established that the object that hit the plaintiff's car was dangling from the tractor trailer and that upon inspection there was no place for it to dangle. The expert reports filed by the defendant remained uncontradicted. The plaintiff relied upon the operation of Civil Procedures Rule 13.01(a) and Supreme Court of Canada judgments, Hercules Management Ltd. v.

5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with driving over.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused had consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the blood alcohol concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The Crown called all its evidence on the first date and the matter was adjourned over two lengthy adjournments at the request of defence for the purpose of canvassing the possibility of calling an expert in relation to the neurological condition of the accused. Defence raised the possibility that the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath or that it would be impracticable to put him before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. 1)The accused had not rebutted the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a). All of the requirements of s. 254(3) had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence disclosed that the officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. 2)There was no other evidence that established the accused did not occupy that seat for the purposes of setting the vehicle in motion.  3)The Court found the accused was 'in care and control' of the motor vehicle pursuant to the presumption in s.258(3). 4)The court found that, considering the case law, the submissions of counsel and after objectively considering all the indicia of impairment known to the officer, there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to ss.253(3)(b) to make a demand for samples of analysis. The totality of the evidence would lead any reasonable person to that conclusion.  5)There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis, Exhibit P1 in these proceedings. The Court found that: 1)Since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, with no risk of setting it in motion, the trial judge should not enter the analysis of whether the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.  6)Given the accused’s physical condition he may not have been able to fully understand his rights or fully exercise them when he in fact spoke to lawyer."
5_2008nssc113.txt,"The mother of two boys, ages 12 and 13, applied to vary access to add a condition that the father only be allowed to drive with the boys in the HRM, on roads with a speed limit of 80km/hr and under. She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party. Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work. She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.",HELD: The court found that the respondent's medical condition and his use of marijuana did not constitute a risk to his children. The court ordered that the remaining provisions of the Varied Corollary Relief Judgment continue in effect and that she receive a cost award. The respondent was not satisfied that the marijuana use was benign and without potential risk for his children and that he was able to drive safely on routes that permit speeds over 80 km/h if the drive was lengthy. The Court ordered that all restrictions on his transport of the children be removed including the provision restricting his marijuana use to eight hours prior to his driving.
5_2008skca56.txt,"The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment. The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","The accused was convicted of sexually assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and also assaulting her using a weapon, to wit a baseball bat. He was sentenced to two years in a federal penitentiary plus two years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. HELD: The appeal against conviction is dismissed. 1) The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on a sentence appeal.  2) The Court found that the loss of the appellant's immigration appeal rights is disproportionately severe collateral sanction, which was unforeseen by the appellant and his counsel at the sentencing hearing and apparently unintended by the sentencing judge. 3) The charge that followed two days later was entirely correct to the circumstances of this case. The trial judge stressed the reasonable doubt standard and he concluded his charge with the direction consistent with R. v. W.(D.)."

He had a previous record for non-violent offences., defendant sentenced to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment; aggravating factors included the defendant's possession and use of a handgun in an area where a number of people were close by and that a bullet had found its way into a nearby residence.","The accused was convicted of two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. The accused had a prior criminal record for non-violent offences such as fraud, possession of a controlled substance and careless storage of a weapon. HELD: A sentence of 9 years was imposed with credit for time spent on remand on the basis of for which would amount in this to 33 months credit. The court must consider the nature and circumstances of the offence and the character of the accused in order to arrive at a fit and proper sentence. An aggravating factor was that handguns were used in an area where a number of people were close by at the after hours bar known as Vegas. Quite few shots were fired and two persons died as result of the gunfire. The offender was acquitted of the two counts and was not being sentenced for those offences today. The fatalities were mentioned simply to highlight what the result of indiscriminate gunfire can be."
5_2011nsca46.txt,"The defendant, who was found guilty of the careless use of a firearm, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace and possession of a restricted or prohibited firearm applied for bail pending appeal. He had been found, in his residence, with a firearm licensed in Alberta but not licensed to be brought into this province or possessed here. The defendant had residences in both Alberta and Nova Scotia but his Halifax residence was now up for sale and he travelled extensively around the world for his work. Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction. Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions. The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","HELD: The appellant was granted release on a recognizance of $25,000 with written reasons. The court found that the appellant was not a flight risk and that his proposed terms of release were inadequate. The appellant appealed his conviction on seven charges, alleging the trial judge erred in failing to find a breach of the Charter when the police entered the appellant's condominium and failed to grant remedy as a result; the minimum sentence provisions of s. 95(1) were unconstitutional; the appellant had no prior criminal record and had complied with the terms of his release in the eight months since he was found guilty."
5_2011skca26.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving and alleged that his estranged wife and daughter lied. The appellant had been represented at trial by experienced counsel but undertook the appeals himself. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appellant had not followed procedures that must be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving to the Court of Queen's Bench and, having failed, then appealed to the Crown. He contended that he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice inasmuch as he had evidence that his estranged wife, out of a desire for revenge, had lied about what occurred. The trial judge found both to be credible witnesses. The appellant also rejected the appellant's account, finding him not credible. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)There are procedures that have to be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence. Otherwise, the courts are left with no basis upon which to act upon allegations of that nature. 2)There is no tenable basis for allowing his appeal, setting aside his conviction, and ordering a new trial. On the facts as found by the trial judge based on the judge's assessments of credibility, the conduct of the accused amounted to dangerous driving within the meaning of the Criminal Code."

The defendant monitored the temperature in the freezer and cooler at the business. The plaintiffs sued because their freezer failed and meat spoiled after a circuit breaker at the business tripped off. The defendant had received no alarm. The plaintiff asserts that the defendant breached the contract by failing to properly monitor the temperature in the freezer. HELD: The contract between the parties was solely for installation and monitoring. The contract did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair the equipment at the plaintiff's business. The Court was satisfied that the defendant was monitoring the signal from the plaintiff's business on the dates in question and no alarm was received. It is not possible to say with any certainty why the defendant did not receive an alarm, but the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff was regularly having its monitoring equipment serviced or repaired. The plaintiff has not proven that the defendant breached the contract. The action is dismissed.","In 2006, Sturgis Meats entered into a contract with Gardon Securities. That contract covered both the installation of temperature monitoring equipment and the month to month monitoring by the defendant of the temperature in the freezer and cooler of the business. Even with this dispute, the defendant continues to monitor those temperatures at the premises. The plaintiff says an employee of the defendant was monitoring the signal from the premises on the dates in question and that no freezer alarm was received before the alarm of August 15, when the monitoring equipment was working properly. HELD: The action was dismissed. Based on the original contract between the parties and ongoing payments being made in 2010, the contract was solely for monitoring of the temperatures in the cooler and freezer at the business and did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair monitoring equipment at that business.

5_2014skca95.txt,"Civil Procedure – Appeal – Leave to AppealLand – Certificate of Pending Litigation The appellant sought leave to appeal the chambers decision not to vacate the certificate of pending litigation registered on behalf of her estranged husband, who was deceased. The respondent’s solicitors filed the certificate of pending litigation after his death. The appellant transferred the land subject to the certificate of pending litigation into her name only and entered into an agreement to sell the land, which could not proceed with the certificate of pending litigation. HELD: The appeal was of sufficient merit and it was not prima facie frivolous or vexatious. The appeal, however, was not found to be of sufficient importance to the practice of law or the Court of Queen’s Bench to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal. There was no new, controversial or unusual issue of practice raised by the appeal. The issues were determined to be better left for resolution by the Court of Queen’s Bench after hearing vive voce evidence at trial.","The wife sought to appeal from a chambers judge's decision not to vacate a certificate of pending litigation registered on behalf of her estranged husband against title to certain lands. The chambers judge did not consider whether the order appealed from was interlocutory or final in nature. She subsequently filed notice of motion seeking either leave to appeal or directions from chambers judge that leave was not required. The wife subsequently transferred the lands into her own name and then entered into an agreement to sell them, which sale will not proceed until the certificate was vacated. HELD: The application for leave was dismissed. 1)The proposed appeal does not raise a new or controversial or unusual issue. Nor does it raise a whole new or uncertain or unsettled point of law; albeit the proposed appeal may raise a valid question of law based on the facts of this matter, it does not transcend the particular in its implications. 2)It is not at all unreasonable to assume that the wife's proposed appeal is of sufficient merit to warrant determination by a panel of the Court of Appeal."
6_1990canlii4137.txt,"This was an application under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the two appellant university professors was invalid and denied the rights of the appellants as guaranteed under ss. 15(1) and (7) of the Charter, and an order for reinstatement and back pay. Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s.15(1) and s.52 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the applicants' rights as guaranteed under the Charter and that the applicants be reinstated as full-time members of the Faculty of the respondent immediately. HELD: 1)The respondent is a wholly independent institution of post-secondary education which manages, administers and controls its property, revenue, business and affairs through its Board of Governors and administration department. The respondent has been free of any influence of the government with regard to its pension and retirement policies. 2)There is no evidence of governmental control that could be regarded as an exercise of government power sufficient to bring the respondent within the application of the charter. In cases involving arrests, detentions, searches and the like, to apply the Charter to purely private action would be tantamount to setting up an alternative tort system. In the area of private discrimination, an entirely new system of civil liability in competition with the dispute resolution mechanisms fostered by human rights legislation would result.  3)The applicant was employed as full time member of the faculty and as a researcher in the Engineering Physics Department. His interest was in the field of acoustics. He attained the age of 65 in 1988. He requested reinstatement with back pay on the basis of his view of the normal retirement date. He also requested that the respondent pay him all compensation due to them as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest and costs of this proceeding.  4)The only real relationship between the government of Nova Scotia and the respondent is that the former provides the respondent with certain funding, 95% of which is unrestricted as to use with the remaining 5% restricted to capital renovations, purchases and renovations. It is unlikely, therefore, that a complainant would resort to constitutional action in the courts, rather than the complaint process under the anti-discrimination laws."
6_1994canlii3963.txt,"The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana, contrary to s. 4(2) and 6(2) of the Narcotic Control Act. RCMP had investigated a tip that a large crop of marijuana plants was being grown on a private property located in a clearing off a woods road. They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants. At trial, the court held their right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure had been violated, and acquitted them. The Crown appealed the acquittal. Per Roscoe, J.A., Chipman, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that there was no s. 8 breach because the respondents did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the field where the marijuana crop was growing. The court reviewed case law regarding 'open fields', and 'uncultivated' lands, and adopted the reasoning in Oliver v. United States, 104 S.Ct.1735(1984) in reaching its conclusion. Per Pugsley, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that the respondents had a reasonable expectation of privacy in activities carried on by them on their private property. As there were no exigent circumstances, the search was not reasonable and the evidence should be excluded.","The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana. At the commencement of their trial in Supreme Court, after the jury selection, a voir dire was held to determine the admissibility of evidence obtained by the police as result of the seizure of marijuana plants. The respondents alleged that their Charter rights under s. 8, to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure, had been violated. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The trial judge found that the police acted in bad faith because they knew or ought to have known that warrantless searches are presumed to be unreasonable, therefore the breach was serious, and that to decide the appeal on that point would be unfair to the police. 2)The court adopted the reasoning of the Supreme Court in Katz v. United States (1967), 389 U.S.C.R. 347 when it interpreted the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution as providing protection for people, not places.  3)The evidence obtained as a result of a warrantless search is tainted. It usually is not admissible. But it may be admissible if its admission would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 4)The respondents did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the clearing where the marijuana plants were growing. The police obtained search warrants to search the premises. No evidence relevant to the case was seized. 5)The appeal should be allowed. The trial judge placed the onus on the Crown to prove that the evidence should be admitted, which is an error in law."
6_1996canlii6791.txt,"Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless. The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse. At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages. They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.","The father of two little boys and his present wife, both medical professionals, claim that the mother of the boys, his ex-wife and child and family counsellor, wrongfully accused them of physically and sexually abusing them.

He sought a declaration that a member of the police service must be informed of any investigation of his conduct prior to the commencement of the investigation as required by s.54 of the Police Act.; the Act does not permit the amendment in Form A discipline notice since it is a statutory form. The relief sought regarding disclosure had been abandoned by the applicant. The applicant argued that the fundamental questions to be addressed revolved around issues of statutory interpretation that must be resolved on a standard of correctness and the alternative remedies were not adequate. The respondent took the position that this Court should not entertain the application as there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act by way of appeal to the provincial Police Commission; that the Chief was entitled to amend the notice and would be entitled to grant leave if required; the hearing officer erred in holding that s.54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the subject member.

6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT: As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside: (1) a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance on each accused dated January 30, 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones; (2) a 9 day video surveillance authorization dated March 19, 1997 authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast; and (3) a search warrant to search the applicant Derksen authorizing the entry of 365 marihuana plants. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was granted and the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrant was excluded from trial. The court held that evidence tendered at this hearing is part of the trial evidence and as such should be tendered viva voce, and in any event evidence given at the preliminary inquiry should not be used as trial evidence in the absence of any of the exceptions justifying admission of preliminary inquiry evidence."
6_2003skqb170.txt,"The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity. The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal. Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.","The appellant was convicted of assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. His sentence was suspended with a one-year probation order and he appealed. During argument on behalf of the appellant, the trial judge made three errors of law leading to the conviction. One of those errors amounted to an error of law; (b)the trial judge referred to photographs depicting the extent, location and nature of injuries suffered by the complainant when no photographs existed or if they were never tendered in evidence; and (c)the learned trial judge erred in law by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof. HELD: The appeal was set aside and a new trial ordered. 1)The trial judge failed to properly consider the defence of necessity. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. 2)There was no miscarriage of justice resulting from the trial. It was immaterial whether there were injuries. The conviction could not be set aside for that error in law alone. The trial judge was correct in applying the test required by R. v. W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742."

I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'. He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them. [5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5. [6] We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access. The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise. The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child.","Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the best interests of the child.

6_2004skpc25.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level. The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'. There was no symbol with it. In the blank that followed was written '5000C'. This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed. The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","The accused was charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s258(1)(g) for the intended purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol levels.

There was also an initialled change to the year in the Notice of Intention to produce Certificate. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1)The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence. 2)The Crown did not intend that there should be a requirement that the instrument be identified, provided that the qualified technician states in the Certificate that an approved instrument was employed. If Parliament intended the contrary to be the case, it would have specifically stated that the approval instrument needed to be identified. 3)The accused did not make any effort to advance the argument that the Crown should not rely upon the model of an instrument designated for the purpose of identifying the accused. She did not advance any of the other relevant factors. 4)The certificate may be used to prove facts, not law. It is not possible to know who made the alteration consisting of the striking out of the word and symbol 'Breathalyzer®' and the writing in of '2' bear his initials. While it is probably the same person who made this alteration that is not initialled, one cannot adequately be sure of this. 5)It is not appropriate to make an instrument identified by way of a make-and-model.

6_2005nsca65.txt,"Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information. The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences. Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered. The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences. If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal.","The Crown appeals from acquittals entered by Judge Sherar of the Provincial Court on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons. The accused brought a motion for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence of one of the elements of the offence, that is, the date of offence as alleged in the Information. The trial judge granted the motion for directed verdict for insufficiency of evidence unrelated to the discrepancy in the date. The appeal was allowed with reasons to follow. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The trial judge erred in allowing the motion. The evidence presented by the Crown was not sufficient to meet the required test, whether there was any evidence upon which a reasonable jury, properly instructed could return a verdict of guilty. 2)The reasons for granting the motion were so inadequate that they did not meet the test for sufficiency of reasons because they do not provide any indication of why there was insufficient evidence."

The issue was whether it was in the child's best interests to relocate from Saskatoon to Edmonton and to what was an appropriate access schedule for the child. The respondent was opposed to the move.

6_2007nssc119.txt,"Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies. Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history. There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down. The mother now sought the return of both children. The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect. Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation. Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency. Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately. The mother continued to require professional intervention.","The matter before the Court concerned the disposition review involving the respondents' children, K.B. born in 1990 and C.B., born in 1993. The respondents were involved in a rocky common law relationship between 1985 and 1995. They lived in Alberta and then Nova Scotia. At the conclusion of the relationship, L.M. became the custodial parent of the children. The children were placed in the supervised care of T.B.'s common law partner, who was given permission to return to Alberta with the children in 2004. During summation, the Agency consented to its continued involvement with the child, but sought the termination of its involvement with her.

6_2008skca156.txt,"The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","HELD: Appeal allowed. This is an appeal by the Crown from an order of a Provincial Court Judge declaring that the respondent is unfit to stand trial. The Crown submits that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence, misstated the evidence and applied the wrong legal test for fitness, apply the wrong burden of proof and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.

6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff purchased a home in 1998. To assist her, she engaged the services of the defendant, Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. After a lengthy search house was purchased the following year. It was owned by the defendants, Edward and Verl Karpinski. Their realtor was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. HELD: The plaintiff sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She says that Ms. Mui and her company fell below the standard of care required of a real estate agent representing the purchaser of a residential property. She also claims aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against Mr. and Mrs. Karpinsk and against T.J. Jacobucci and Trevi Holdings Ltd., asserting that their acts and omissions exacerbated her distress. 1) The home did not meet the plaintiff’s expectations. The search for a suitable home expanded to acreages in the neighbouring environs. 2) The plaintiff was unable to obtain a building permit for the house because of a lack of proper plumbing and heating equipment. She did not have a copy of the building permit issued by the Rural Municipality of Corman Park. The property was too expensive for her to afford. 3) The defendant was not the only realtor to have visited the plaintiff. The realtor had visited the property several times in 1998 and 1999. She said that she had just learned that the chimney was approved for a wood fireplace. The chimney had been moved over 300 kilometres from its original building site. There was no discussion about home inspection. The offers were open until June 20, 1999 at noon and were accepted by the defendant the next morning. 4) The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to damages for latent defects. The court ordered the defendant to pay $250,000 for the home and $350,000 to have the property assessed based upon the assessed value of the property. 5) The Court ordered the plaintiff to file a complaint with the RCMP alleging that the defendants had breached the terms of the contract between them and the plaintiff and that they were liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the realtor. 6) The first time the plaintiff viewed the property was during the fall of 1998. She attended at the request of her sister and her husband. She had not seen the house for several years and had not been able to"

The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","The plaintiff, one of the defendants in the main proceeding, moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it, pursuant to Rule 44.10.

The defendant argued that the matter should be heard in Windsor, in the area in which the dispute arose. HELD: The attachment order was terminated.  1)The affidavit of the plaintiff did not properly incorporate the contents of the statement of claim. 2)The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants was not sufficient reason to dispose of the corporate veil. 3)The plaintiff had established conduct on the part of the defendant to justify the maintenance of the attachment order.

Held, motion dismissed. Under Rule 14.01, the motions judge must decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. The party seeking production must establish relevance. Here, the only evidence was regarding the occurrence of the fires; there was no evidence as to the manner of the defendant's operation of the business in the second location that would establish relevance to the action regarding the first location.

The respondent, at age 61, should not be forced to work overtime in order to meet his spousal support obligations. The Court found there was economic disparity between the income of the petitioner and the income of the respondent and awarded an interim award of non-compensatory spousal support in the amount of $400 per month, retroactive to November 1, 2013, until further order of the Court.","FIAT. Following the provisions of the Divorce Act for awards of spousal support, the court considers the economic disparity between the respondent and the petitioner's incomes, that is $79,320.00 versus $56,103.00, is sufficiently disparate and upon which an interim award of non-compensatory support is appropriate. HELD: 1) The court ordered the respondent to pay $700.00 per month commencing November 1, 2013 and on the first day of each and every month thereafter until further order of the court.  2) The petitioner was 61 years old. His regular hourly rate of pay is $28.50. The respondent indicates that he intends to work a 40 hour work week at the rate of $28 per hour. This represents an annual income of $59,280. The petitioner did not seek any form of corollary relief pursuant to the s. 5(2nd Supp.) nor did the petitioner claim for child support. 3) The respondent's gross income in the year 2013 to his pay period ending December 14, 2013 was $95,275.73. This latter sum included $28,553.68 of overtime income. At the respondent's age and given his state of health, this Court will not compel him to work more than a 40-hour work week by attributing to him an income which is based upon significant overtime. 4) There was no evidence that the respondent worked more than 40 hours per week as he did in previous years. The evidence established that he earned rental income from leasing farm land. The net rental income, after payment of property taxes, yields $8,000 to the respondent. Given the respondent’s income, the Court would not compel the respondent on an interim basis to attribute his income to him. 5) The Court did not require the respondent in assessing support whether child support or spousa support, as it does not compel a payor to work overtime. The Court was not compelled to rely on the income of the payor at the time of separation."

7_2010nsca95.txt,"The first defendant was the lessee and driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the plaintiff. The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent Chrysler on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of Giffin. The Chambers judge concluded that there was not a real chance of success on the arguments advanced by Giffin respecting Chrysler's alleged liability by operation of the Motor Vehicle Act. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The issue is unambiguously determined by the precedents. The reverse onus provision has no application on the facts of this case. 2) The appellants did not demonstrate entitlement to judgment on the issue of whether the lease agreement was actually a rental contract pursuant to s. 62 of the Act. 3) The lease falls into the 'lease with right of purchase' exception to the definition of 'owner.' The lease contains the characteristics noted in s. 2(ak); it cannot realistically be depicted as'rental contract'. The circumstances both before and during the hearing before the Committee could be considered would be considered. 4) The argument that the lease between Giffin and Chrysler was actually an 'ownership' of the vehicle, nor the claim that Chysler is an owner, had no real chance to succeed on the undisputed facts.  5) There was no evidence that the Gold Key Lease was filed or was filed with the Registrar."
7_2011nspc27.txt,"The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery. A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","The police stopped a car driven by a young person suspected of having been involved in a robbery with a firearm at a specific address in Sackville. The police stopped the car and found some drugs, some items reported to have been stolen in the robbery, a gun and a brass knuckle ring.

None of the people he described fit the description of the accused. Had he simply not been able to identify M.M., his failure to identify him might be explained away. HELD: The court found that an in dock identification was not the most compelling of evidence. A person who is asked to identify his assailant and for the first time picks the accused out of the dock, may be acting in good faith. He may also be subconsciously drawn to the one person in the courtroom who is most obviously implicated by virtue of where he is seated."

HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.",HELD: The Court declined to issue summonses as requested. The Court held that it did not have jurisdiction to issue the summons. It ordered that the matter be heard by a Provincial Court Judge.

The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012. The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew. Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved. This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial? HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act. With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action. As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it.

It ordered that the Court accept the plaintiff's affidavit primarily on the basis that it was filed on the eve of trial. If the struck or dissolved corporation still wants to file an affidavit in support of its case, then the Court will disregard the contents of her affidavit. 3) Jurisdiction of the Court was to be determined prior to the continuation of this simplified trial despite the dissolution of the corporation."
7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","The Crown appealed the sentence imposed on the defendant on a charge of unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Forest Resources Management Act. The Crown argued that a fine of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge was an unreasonably low penalty for the offence the evidence established. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge held that, after considering all of the evidence, he was not satisfied that during the period in the indictment, the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the wood he sold to an undercover officer was wood harvested from Crown lands. 2)The Court held that the sentence should have been quashed. 3)It was illogical and inconsistent for the trial judge to have convicted him of illegally trafficking in forest products. 4)The evidence of conservation officers was uncontradicted."

They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.",HELD: The Court granted the application.

7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in these proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. The policy stipulated that the funds paid as premiums to Empire Life with its funds were the property of the Crown and properly payable to it as the Crown's agent. Since no other person had a competing interest to the insurer's right and title, the interpleader order sought by Empire Life was unnecessary. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)The court found that insured clients under the Policy have an arguable claim to the Surpluses in question and since Ag Credit maintains its claim to these same funds, this is an appropriate case to grant interplead relief under Rule 675 of The Queen's Bench Rules.  2)The Court found that Empire Life acted in full compliance with its duty of uberrima fides in bringing the potentially valid claims of the insured clients to the attention of the Court and in resisting the claim of Ag Credit to pay the monies direct to it; and that it did not collude with any of the claimants.  3)There was no evidence that the insurer had advanced premiums on behalf of its clients and thus any overpayment of premiums arising under the contract were its property. 4)It was not necessary for the court to determine, on this application, that it was entitled to payment of the funds in question."

The city appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge did not commit an error in law. S.363(3) of the Halifax City Charter, under which the respondent was charged, refers to land as opposed to buildings, and cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings, a category already dealt with in s.363(6), which covers the unsightliness of buildings caused by neglect, not overt actions.","The respondent owned several buildings on Robie Street.

This order was then brought before a Queen's Bench Judge as required by s.5 of the Act for review. The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section. The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered.

They also agree that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause. It is clear that the subject matter of the clause is a 'Participating Interest in the Program Land or a Project Area'. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement. However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole. Accordingly, the voting agreement is not caught by subsection 14.01.","Fulltext of judgment follows: The Court dismissed the appeal with costs to be taxed. The facts of this case and the relevant provisions of the agreements in issue may be found in the reasons for judgment.

8_2009nssc351.txt,"The action, originally filed in 2000, concerned allegations of breach of - fiduciary duty, trust, industry regulations/standards, contract; and claims of negligence and malpractice. These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant. The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years. The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars. There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years). While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant. There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay. After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here. On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice. There is a significant documentary record of the transactions. The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner. The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time. While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice. Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","The plaintiffs sought to dismiss a proceeding for want of prosecution pursuant to Rule 28.13 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The application was granted in accordance with the 1972 Rules because it was filed before December 31, 2008. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant was responsible for a considerable period of delay and that RBC acquiesced to a slow tempo of litigation. HELD: 1) Even allowing for two-and-a-half years of delay, this means the delay of attributable to the plaintiffs was of some eight years, which I am satisfied is inordinate. 2) The delay was caused by the death of the plaintiff's solicitor and the difficulty in locating competent counsel to advance the claim after his death. There was no injustice in his bearing the consequences of his own fault."

8_2015skqb144.txt,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The petitioner was granted interim shared custody with the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month in child support and costs. The parties had been in a relationship for some time. The petitioner brought an Answer and Counter-Petition in 2012 contesting the respondent’s claims for sole custody, specified and supervised parenting time, the request for restraining order and costs and the parties’ agreement to have the child in the interim care of the petitioner for a period of 9 to 5 days.

8_2017skqb249.txt,"HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel was constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)A term permitting an appeal from the arbitrators' decision on an error of law simply does not fall into the category of the obvious, or something that goes without saying, in the factual matrix of this case. Such an implied term is not akin, for instance, to the implied term of good faith in contractual negotiation, or the term of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment. If the right to appeal is not abrogated by the language of the agreements, the court does not have licence to reconstruct a contract on equitable principles, or from the point of view of what the parties should reasonably have contemplated. 2)The term should generally not be implied where it is inconsistent with the express terms of the contract. The agreements contained an implied condition that permits the parties to appeal arbitrators’ decisions, with leave, on the basis of errors in law. The court can imply terms that are in the nature of things that go without saying but are necessary to give business efficacy to the transaction. 3)The provisions of the agreement exclude the right of appeal on questions of law, pursuant to s. 45(2) of the Act. It is not clear that there are some cases in which term must be implied in order to ensure that the intention of the parties is not defeated, or that the parties explicitly 'contracted out' of any rights of appeal. 4)HAL argues that the agreements signed with HAL contain a 'final and binding' clause that permits them to appeal an arbitrator’s decision on a question of law. It also argues that their contracts contain a clause relating to the minimum sales target (MIDSL). 5)The parties referred to one, and only one, specific instance in which an appeal would be permissible. In that case, the arbitration panel found that the agreement between the parties and the respondent did not impose an obligation on them to purchase a set number of licences from HAL. The respondent took the position that if it failed to comply with the MIDSL, it simply lost the rights to exclusive distribution, rather than being obligated to pay HAL for 25 licences regardless of how many were sold. It alleged that the respondent failed to meet its sales obligations and demanded payment of the shortfall. 5)With respect to the position advanced by HAL, a term permitting appeal from an arbitrators"

The court found that the judgment should be set aside as a matter of right because it was in excess of the amount due. The judgment was also set aside on the merits. It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action. As well, the defendant had provided an arguable defence to the claim in that it pled in its proposed defence of non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act.

HELD: The application is granted. 1) The Court cannot accept that a time frame of 28 days is sufficiently long for the court to prevent Key from defending the action. That is only seven days past the date Sollows was permitted to note the action for default. Given that Key's then counsel responded to the action soon after default judgment was entered, this delay in defending is insufficient to deny Key its day in court.  2) In exercising judicial discretion under Rule 9-13, the Court must also conclude that Key is entitled to have the default judgement set aside on its merits. 3) The application should be supported by an affidavit setting out the circumstances under which the default arose and disclosing defence on the merits."

9_1998canlii1737.txt,"The plaintiff paid its municipal property taxes as assessed for three years. On appeal it was held to be entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total amount of $420,000. The plaintiff, pursuant to s. 41(I) of the Judicature Act, sought payment of interest on this amount from the date of the payments. Awarding 5 months interest, that the date from which interest is calculated in this type of action is upon completion of the appeal process. An appropriate interest claim under s. 41(I) therefore only exists for the five month period between the Court of Appeal's assessment determination and the refund of the property tax five months later.","The plaintiff municipal tax payer paid its property taxes as assessed for the years 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 but on appeal was held entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total amount of $420,177.13.  The plaintiff sought interest pursuant to s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act on the refund from the date it made the overpayments in response to HRM's tax invoices requiring payment of those amounts on the ""due dates"" in 1994 and 1995. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld the Utility and Review Board's assessment determination in March 1997. HRM paid the refund of overpaid real property taxes to Canada Trust in September 1997 and on the unpaid interest until September 1997. Canada Trust contended pre judgment is payable on the overpayment of property taxes from the time of remittance for the same reasons pre judgment interest was payable in Cherubin Metalworks Limited v. Nova Scotia (1995), 1995 CanLII 4314 (C.A.), at this point failure by HRM to repay the overpaid taxes could result in an action for recovery of that overpayment, pursuant to the Assessment Act, supra. An interest rate of 8.75% being a rate equatable to the interest rate charged by Canada Trust on overdue taxes (prime plus 4 %) is an appropriate rate on the principal amount for the five month period between the Nova Scotia court of Appeal assessment determination and the payment of the property tax refund in September 1996 as well as on unpaid interest from September 1997 to the date of judgment. HELD: 1)Costs were to be determined on the basis of pre-judgment interest on the amount overpaid as soon as the appeal process concluded. 2)There was no cause of action for return of any over payment of taxes until after the appeal provisions were exhausted. The date from which interest is calculated in this action to pursue Canada Trust's right to interest on a judgment for substantial overpayment is upon completion of the appeal. 3)Interest could be claimed under s41(i)(i) and s40(ii)of the Judiciature Act. Section 90 clearly states there is no entitlement to repayment of an overpayment when the taxes were recalculated when Canada Trust was required to overpay its property tax, thereby causing it to suffer loss."

In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed. Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision. The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case.

Accused not guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The confrontation between the accused and the complainant was one continuing episodic event and the complainant's actions were provoked by the accused. However, no causal relationship was shown between the blows of the accused and the broken nose sustained by the complainant. There were too many variables and probabilities as to how the complainant's nose might have become broken.",HELD: The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm to the complainant. The court found that the accused did not intend to cause bodily harm. The complainant sustained a nasal fracture for which he sought and received medical attention. The accused applied the Criminal Code s.34(1) for his defence. This section only affords self defence in cases of aggression. It must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the blows delivered by the accused when they were on the floor were the actual cause or were contributing factors outside the de minimis range.

The s. 7 expenses claimed by the petitioner include dental work of $112.90 for Kristen, orthodontic work for Brina and costs associated with Brina's post-secondary education. It is uncontroverted that Brina has disabilities that necessitate certain tools such as a computer for her to be successful in her post-secondary training. HELD: 1) The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses and there shall be an order accordingly. 2) The September 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in Brina's s. 7 expenses. Accordingly the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s. 7 costs. 2) The crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred on Brina's part and will assist her with her future plans. 3) The Zeller's supplies would normally be covered under the Table support and that expense is disallowed. 4) Brina's s. 7 post-secondary expenses are $7,123.72 and include tuition, crisis prevention class and books, required university books, bus pass, black cartridge for the printer, Shaw internet, Microsoft licence, computer repairs and updated virus protection.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to have arrears fixed with regard to s. expenses related to her daughter's post-secondary education and in addition requests that the amount to be fixed for ongoing s. 7 expenses.

Further, new evidence will be admitted only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial. Neither of these requirements is met. 2) The constitutional challenge is not properly before the Court as notice is required when the constitutionality of a bylaw is impugned.

The trial justice convicted them of breaching Bylaw 2.1995, which provides that no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned Hamlet. The appellants did not lead evidence at trial. They did not dispute that they were keeping cattle on their property. Their defence related to points of law. HELD: The application to admit new evidence was dismissed. The evidence will be admitted on appeal only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial. The uncertainty on the evidence does not exist. The references to proposed amendments in the letter would not establish that there had been any amendments.

The plaintiff requested that the defendant hold a show cause hearing to determine whether certain producers had contravened their licence but when a procedural breakdown occurred as to how that hearing would be conducted, with the plaintiff seeking and being denied an adjournment, the hearing was held without the plaintiff's participation. The plaintiff brought an application for mandamus to compel the defendant to hold a new hearing and filed two affidavits providing some detail and background information as to its reasoning for its failure to attend the hearing and the parties' differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan. The defendant brought an application to strike certain of the affidavits filed by the plaintiff on the basis that they were an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not forming part of the record. Application to strike affidavits dismissed; the Rules do not preclude the admission of affidavits on an application and, in the present circumstances, reason and fairness militated against ruling the affidavits inadmissible. There was no authority for denying the parties the use of affidavits should this application proceed as a jurisdictional dispute and, should it proceed by way of an error of law on the face of the record, the affidavits were also admissible to complete the record.","The applicant board applied to have the affidavits of two of its members struck out as an attempt to put evidence to the Court on matters not in or forming part of the Record of the Council Panel in its adjudicative setting. The applicant board had refused to appear at the hearing because their request for adjournment had been denied, leaving council with no decision to make. Dismissing the application, that there must be a real dispute with respect to the authority of the Board to suspend and deal with licenses, and the authority to cancel or revoke or suspend licenses, as well as evidentiary issues of the nature raised in Waverley et al v. Nova Scotia (1993), 123 N.S.R. (2d) 46 (SC), the applicant board argued that affidavit evidence is only admissible if it raises jurisdictional issues or if they complain of an error in law. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)If the Court reviewed the present application as a jurisdictional dispute (which seems to be the position of all parties), that quotation does not form authority for denying the parties the use of affidavits. 2)The affidavits were always admissible to show that the record was incomplete, as for instance, that the conviction omitted the evidence of one of the witnesses. If the hearing was held as scheduled, without the participation of the board, the decision would be quashed and new hearing ordered.  3)The court found that affidavits are admissible on an application for certiorari. The Court should restrict itself to considering the record as produced by the tribunal. The issue is procedural, it is being argued that the reception of the two affidavits into evidence would be inappropriate and contrary to case precedent. 4)The Court found that it was not appropriate to impose a writ requiring the Council to hold a new hearing."

The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother.

Johnson Seeds entered contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting to secure product for resale. After extended negotiations the defendant eventually signed and mailed the standard form contract but never received an executed copy. The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993. The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price. HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action. 1)There was a valid contract between the parties. Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract. 2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract. The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone. There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94. The formal contract did not expressly set forth these conditions. Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.  4)Farr took a calculated risk and sold the seed which alleviated his immediate cash-flow problem. Johnson Seeds waited until the last possible day under the written contract terms to call the contract in an effort to position itself to claim increased damages for breach of contract.","The plaintiff claims damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. The contract between the plaintiff and the defendant was written in 1993 and signed in 1993. In 1993 the contract was signed by both parties and both parties considered that they had signed a binding and legally enforceable contract in May and in November 1993. The defendant retained a fully executed copy of the contract on its file in Arborg, Manitoba. In addition to the fax, the defendant had used the mail to communicate the offer to Johnson Seeds and it should therefore have been in the reasonable contemplation of the plaintiff that he would receive a fully-executed copy.

b_1999canlii13927.txt,"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the Court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial, calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The Court held that the Charter right was at stake and that the accused was entitled to exercise his or her right to a fair and impartial trial. The Court reviewed the authorities which have been filed by the Crown. It concluded that the fairness of these proceedings was enhanced by the fact that the court had not created a structured procedure for Charter applications in Provincial Court trials."

The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The applicant applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the Corollary Relief Judgment dated February 20th, 2003. Although the parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation, the parties had been married for some time prior to the separation.

The applicant argued that the Agreement did not conform with the objectives of the Act and that there had been no material change in the circumstances of either party since it was signed. HELD: The application was dismissed.

Rather, the court is to look at all of the evidence and determine whether one party took advantage of the vulnerability of another party in the negotiations. 5)The agreement was based on a common understanding of the economic and social consequences of separation and was not intended to be an exhaustive list and each case must be decided on its own facts."
b_2007nsca75.txt,"A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway. When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed. Appeal dismissed. At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit. It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit. Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, if granted, an appeal from an order dismissing a summary judgment application brought by the defendant.

b_2010nssc125.txt,"The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","The plaintiff was charged with dangerous driving causing death. Following the laying of criminal charges, the plaintiff's employer suspended him from work without pay and offered to use their legal counsel to defend him in relation to the criminal charges. The plaintiff appealed the decision of the Court of Appeal which held that the trial judge erred in admitting into evidence the video re-enactment of the accident that had been prepared by Cst. Thivierge and, in allowing into evidence, the opinion of the RCMP Traffic Analyst when there was an insufficient factual basis established for his opinion. HELD: The Court found that the appeal court did not have the benefit of this information when arriving at their decision and in commenting as they did on the defendant's failure to object to the admission of the video evidence. The evidence should not have been introduced by the Crown, nor should counsel have referred to the theory in summation."

As a result, a situation existed where the class action process could continue on only part of the claim until the appeal of consumer protection act issues was heard.

b_2011skpc30.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care and control of a motor vehicle and care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.",HELD: The Court held that the information to obtain blood samples did not constitute reasonable grounds for the belief that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. A warrant to search for blood was issued pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter respecting the violation of the accused's s. 8 rights. The Court reviewed the whole of the material presented at trial and determined that the Certificate of Analyst and the report from the analyst were not sufficient grounds to admit the accused into evidence. The warrant was invalid.
b_2016skqb297.txt,"HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made. The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.","FIAT: The petitioner’s application seeks orders granting her exclusive possession of the family home, primary residence of the children and supervised access only for the respondent father. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) After considering all of the evidence, it is unable to conclude there is a risk of harm.  2) The court cannot rely on opinion evidence that the petitioner is not entitled to give and to which I cannot reasonably give weight. The evidence before the court is that the respondent has anger management problems that make him and his daughters fearful of him and addictions to pornography and masturbation that make it impossible for them to continue to reside in the same home. 3) The respondent has not provided factual evidence as background to his opinion. Much of it is expressly disputed by the petitioner or to the extent allegations are acknowledged by the respondent to have some factual basis, that evidence relates to significantly dated matters. 4) The Court must err on the side of caution, whether or not proper evidentiary foundation has been established, that the present situation is one of the most serious allegations that can be made against a parent, because there are risks the children need to be protected from. 5) The evidence is that there is an artificial set of circumstances that, other things being equal, would militate against the fostering of a proper post-separation relationship between parent and child. The court should not simply abdicate its responsibility to assess and determine the risk involved with unsupervised access. 6) There is no evidence the petitioner has rebutted the presumption that increased contact between the respondent and the children would in fact be to her benefit."
c_1993canlii3443.txt,"This was an appeal of a decision which denied variation of a maintenance award where a lump sum had been previously ordered. The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application. Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court, that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation. The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances. Accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to vary awards of lump sum child support made pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act.","This was an appeal from the decision of a Family Court Judge who held a pre-trial conference at which time the respondent raised a jurisdictional question, arguing that the payment of the lump sum in 1985 fully and finally discharged his responsibility for child support. At issue was whether an order for lump sum payment under the Children of Unmarried Parents Act, R.S.N.S., 1967, c.32, made shortly after the boy's birth was subject to variation. It was possible to arrive at the conclusion merely by considering the scheme of the Act and the order made by Judge MacDonald. However any lingering doubt is removed by s.34, which states with finality that 'this Part', the part dealing with the father's civil liability to pay maintenance, to which the Family Maintenance Act is the successor legislation, is the operative portion of the order."

Under the existing order the children's primary residence was with their Father. A custody investigation conducted in 1990 when the mother had first commenced this application had recommended that the existing arrangement be continued. The Father now intended, however, to move with the children to Ontario to take additional education. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Judge found that the move to Ontario was a sufficient change of circumstances to permit a variation application to proceed. She therefore proceeded to consider if the move was in the best interests of the children. 2)The Judge reviewed recent authorities from across Canada dealing with whether a custodial parent should be permitted to move with the children. 3)In the circumstances of this case the Judge was convinced that the move was reasonable and was not motivated by any desire on the part of the Father to thwart the Mother's access.","This was an application for an order varying the judgment of Dickson J. of the 5th of January 1990 in which he gave judgment for divorce and joint custody to the parents of two boys. The parties had separated in December 1988 and had entered into a separation agreement in which the parties agreed to joint custody, residence with the father and generous access to the mother. The mother applied to vary the judgment by granting the father sole custody of the boys, or joint custody with principal residence with mother. HELD: The application was allowed. 1)The court found that the best interests of the children lie with the mother's being with the custodial parent. 2)The mother's wish to move to Canada was bona fide and not motivated by a wish to thwart the father's access. 3)The evidence showed that the father had, together of course, with his present wife, the day to day care of the four children from their early years onward except when they were exercising the access. 4)The father's move was to thwart his ex-wife's access since there does not seem to be any dispute about this since 1990, and indeed friends and neighbours from the area filed affidavits stating how much the boys enjoyed their visits with their mother and how they fitted in with the people of that town and environs."

When his federal government management position was declared redundant, the applicant received a retiring allowance of $75,646 in May 1997. The respondent opposed the application on the basis there had been no change in circumstances since the judgment was granted; she had no other income than the support payments and child tax credit; alternatively, there were special provisions in the parties' separation agreement which would permit the court to award an amount that differs from the amount prescribed by the Guidelines.HELD: 1)The judgment the applicant sought to vary was made after the coming into force of the Guidelines. It did not however include a determination of child support made in accordance with the Guidelines. There was no change in the childrens' or mother's circumstances. The applicant was unemployed but was still benefiting from his retiring allowance at the time of the order which he no longer enjoyed. A variation was warranted as there had been a change in the father's financial means and circumstances.

The provision for child support in a specified amount greater than that provided in the Guidelines was not a 'special provision' as contemplated by s17(6.2) of the Divorce Act given the change in circumstances of the applicant whose annual income had dropped from $55,500 to $24,000 a year.  3)No order was made as to costs.","FIAT.

He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in this proceeding, there were questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial. After listening to the tapes in their entirety, I am of the view they have the opposite effect. They speak volumes about the father's character and motivations while shedding little light on the mother's. HELD: The Court allowed the tapes to be admitted here in their totality, but on the condition they went in unedited. The Court was of the opinion that the tapes had the contrary effect as they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated the abuse that was occurring in the mother’s home. The tapes were inadmissible unless their authenticity is established, they are shown to be true and unaltered record and the voices have been properly identified. They are subject to the standard test governing admissibility of evidence in that they must be relevant and probative."

The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt.

The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages.

Both parties appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract. The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation. Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","HELD: Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed.

HELD: The application was dismissed. A reasonable and fit party and party level of costs, taxed and allowed in the amount of $4,000, and the defendant is entitled to judgment. 1)The defendant made an offer of settlement. The sale price of the property which was approximately $2 million,000 was not, in my view, the appropriate amount involved and it was very difficult and in fact impossible for me to really get a handle on what amount of loss of profits was being pursued or to what extent the defendants were monetarily at risk. 2)Canada Lands set out that its solicitor and client fees to the date of the hearing amounted to $24,856.50. While time sheets, time sheets and time sheets can be very helpful in determining party and political costs, the level of solicitors' fees in this application is not very helpful."

The employer argues that the plaintiff was dismissed for cause.

At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment. It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her. In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal. Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.  2) The contract of employment was a term contract extending from May to August 31, 2004. The plaintiff was dismissed on July 12. But for her dismissal, she would have worked for the rest of July and for the month of August or 36 days. 3) In this case the plaintiff made reasonable effort to seek and maintain employment.

The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions. The plaintiff is a councillor. The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act. There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council. The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council. The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the parties is a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. 2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful. This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care.

c_2006skqb335.txt,"FIAT: The former vice-president of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan. He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour. He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application. Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart. It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart. The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart. HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed. The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.  1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit. This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility. The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents. 2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents. There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.  3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart. Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations. Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart. However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them. Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias. To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy. That is not good enough.","FIAT: Wal-Mart Canada Corp. brought three applications. The first motion was brought by the union. It alleged that the actions of the Unions, the interference by the Government and the presence of certain publications demonstrate that the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board is biased or, at the very least, there is a reasonable apprehension of bias. The union applied for an order striking and removing virtually all of the material filed in support of the application. The application was dismissed. HELD: The relief sought by the Union should be granted and the application brought by Wal-mart should be dismissed. Although there is no admissible evidence before me, believe my account is accurate. It is argued that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings which involve the applicant. The documents meet neither requirement.

Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make.

The amendments will not interfere with the date set for filing the appeal as originally framed. Any prejudice to the respondent or intervenor which may result if the amended ground is found to be without merit is not attributable to the fact that the ground is advanced by way of amendment as opposed to having been included in the original notice.

Although both she and her husband had good incomes, it would still take several more years to discharge the loans without prejudicing her family's reasonably frugal lifestyle. Relief granted; to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties.

c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","HELD: The accused was found guilty of possession of a firearm contrary to s. 8 of the Criminal Code, unlawful storage of a sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun, a Lakefield Mark II rifle and ammunition, in a careless manner, and having some control over the guns located at his father’s residence.  1)The accused was convicted of trafficking firearms.  2)The Crown was not satisfied that the accused could assert a privacy interest in order to obtain the protection of s.8 of the Charter and then, when that application went badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. The accused could not have obtained a Charter application in relation to the guns seized from him. 3)The evidence on the firearms seized from the accused was that they were firearms within the meaning of the criminal code and that they and the two magazines had been correctly identified and classified in the charges against the accused. 4)There was nothing to the continuity/integrity of the exhibits. 5)The court was unable to decide whether the accused had constructive and/or joint possession of the firearms at the time of his arrest or whether the intercepts constituted a prohibited device within s. 84(1) of the Code."

The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta. The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months.

d_1995canlii4259.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","An interpleader application by the Shubenacadie Band Council to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owing by the Band under a construction contract entered into by the respondent for the construction of residential homes on the reserve.

d_2002skqb80.txt,"The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion.","The applicant bank loaned the respondent $37,700 upon a security of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer. Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made the respondent aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. The applicant sought to defeat the security interest upon the ground that she was at all times the real owner of the vehicle, had made the payments and was always in possession of the car. The Credit Union's claim was based on his being one of the named purchasers in the original agreement and being the registered owner. All other indicia of ownership were in her favour."

The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion.

There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","This was an appeal from an order made pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act requiring the appellant father to pay maintenance for his son. The appellant had a brief relationship in 1981 when his mother was 16 years old. He had recently completed grade 12 at Millwood High School and had re-enrolled in Grade 12 in order to improve his marks for university entrance. At the time of the accident, the appellant was living with his mother. He was abusing drugs and alcohol and was unable to work or further his education. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs payable by the appellant to Ms. Davis in the amount of $2,000 together with disbursements as taxed or agreed. The order for support was not premised on the appellant's continuing dependency as a result of his pursuit of post-secondary studies. It was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order."
d_2005nsca71.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. The court disbelieved his evidence, principally because it was found to be internally inconsistent. The court found that the appellant had attempted to portray himself as being good to the children but had admitted on cross-examination that the children had been removed from the home due to allegations of physical abuse and lack of food. There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","HELD: Conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. The conviction constitutes a miscarriage of justice and must be set aside. The judge's reasons for rejecting the accused's evidence were based on misapprehensions of the evidence because she drew an inference from it that is not supportable in law or logic.  1) The Court found that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence by failing to give proper effect to the evidence. The Court concluded that the judge’s reasons were substantial, material and essential to the conviction.  2) The court found a chain of reasoning which was not available to the judge or in logic on this record. The trial judge erred by characterizing the evidence as 'internally inconsistent'. The inference which the judge drew from this evidence could not have been more unjustified."
d_2005nssc322.txt,"The plaintiff, who was injured in a rear-end motor vehicle accident, applied for summary judgment and an interim payment of damages. Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.","This was an application for an order for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment under the Civil Procedure Rules 31.01.

The defendant argued there was a significant amount of other factors relating to the plaintiff’s health including depression, anxiety, depression and other problems she was having with her health. HELD: The costs of this appeal and of the application before Judge Burke were to be borne by the defendant. Judgement was entered against the respondent/defendant as to liability with damages to be determined. 1)There was an 'air of realty' to the defence. 2)The evidence submitted by way of the plaintiffs affidavits caused the court difficulty. 3)The plaintiff was making a significant claim yet when one listens to the defendant's counsel and reads the material attached to his affidavit, one concludes there are a significant number of other things relating to her health that have resulted in any on going inability of the plaintiff to work in any capacity. If the brake lights did not work then the defendant drove straight into the rear of her car. The traffic light turned red. To strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have enough care or control of his vehicle and consequently the collision occurred. The bald statement in the pleadings does not disclose the existence of an actual or probable defence and cannot fend off an application."
d_2006nsca124.txt,"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The judge applied the standard upon which he was to review the decision to issue the warrant. The evidence obtained as result of the search was wrongly excluded and had it been admitted, the result would not necessarily have been the same. In a thorough and careful analysis, the judge unquestionably articulated the appropriate legal principles. He acknowledged that even had the warrant been properly quashed, the police conduct did not justify excluding the evidence obtained in the search. He substituted his view of the evidence for that of the issuing JP. This led him down the road to reversible error."

There is no reference to Richie whose name appears on the tenancy agreement. 2) Even though the decision states that the Notice of Hearing was properly served, that cannot be the end of the matter given that there is nothing in the file which would indicate any directions having been given to the landlord with respect to service other than personal service. Ivy and Richie did not appear at the hearing and the decision does not even identify Richie as being one of the tenants. More is required to ensure service of and notice to all the tenants. 3) There are no notes nor is there anything in the decision which would permit the Court to conclude that the issue of service on Ivy and Richie was ever considered by the Rentalsman. The matter must be returned to the Rentalsman for a rehearing upon proof of service of the hearing on all of the tenants.","This is an appeal by Rich-Prop Investments Ltd. pursuant to s. 49 of The Residential Tenancies Act. The issues are whether all the tenants had proper notice of the termination of the tenancy and the hearing, whether the landlord could give notice of termination without any cause, and whether the Rentalsman could refuse to grant a writ of possession when there was an outstanding order of the landlord. HELD: The matter was remitted to the landlord for rehearing upon proof of service of the Notice of Hearing on all of the tenants. There will be no order as to costs.  1) Section 49 of the Act permits either landlord or tenant to terminate monthly tenancy.

d_2007skqb266.txt,"FIAT: The primary issue is whether the father should pay for tutoring expenses. HELD: 1) The father is not opposed to Kody receiving some additional educational assistance. However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400.","FIAT: The matter was before me in Chambers on July 20, 2007. On that date made a number of orders regarding child support as well as an order regarding summer access. The issues to be resolved were: 1) what, if any, should the father pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children? 2) if the father's share of both childcare costs and Sylvan Learning Centre costs are necessary and reasonable. The father shall pay his proportionate share of the cost of Sylvan learning centre expenses being an amount equal to 71% of the total cost. 3) the mother's claim for interim spousal support is made pursuant to s. 7(1)(d) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines (the “Guidelines”). 4) Although the father will be stretched, I believe the Sylvan Leisure Centre expenses are necessary, reasonable and are necessary. 5) the father shall contribute 75% of his child support contribution to the sum of $1,950 per month until Sylvan fees are paid in full. 6) The mother's evidence discloses that both children, but more particularly Kody, born October 6, 1998, is in need of specialized educational program given his current problems at school. The mother seeks retroactive support for the time period from February 2006 to February 2007. Both the mother and father acknowledge that the father did commence making reasonable child support payments as of February 2007, but the father has taken no steps to research alternative educational programs for the summer of 2007. In the interim application, the father was unable to make a retroactive child support order because there was significant conflict on the evidence regarding the payment of loans by the father during this period of time and the issue of whether or not the mother refused to accept payments being offered by him. If the mother wishes to pursue the issue, she may do so when and if she wishes."
d_2009nssm48.txt,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","This is an appeal by the Landlord from an order of the Director dated August 31, 2009. That order effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy. It also denied the tenant's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the landlord refused to renew for another year. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the tenancy was declared to have been converted from a one-year to a month tenancy because the tenant refused to give his reasons why he believed it was not in his interest to have a month-to-month tenancy. 1)An arbitrary decision would be one that is random or based on purely personal whim. An unreasonable one would have no credible rationale behind it. 2)It is impossible to say that this Landlord was being arbitrary or unreasonable in refusing consent. It is, after all, his building and the financial consequences of long vacancy will be borne by him."

The mother was unable to parent any of the children on her own. It was concluded under s.11(b) of the Act that there was no adult person able and willing to provide for the children's needs and physical or emotional harm may come to the children if it had not already. 2)The father had recently pleaded guilty to sexual assault on an eight year old girl which could, depending on the facts be a ground under s.11(a)(iii) of the Act for a finding of need for protection.","The Minister of Social Services sought an order under s.37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act permanently committing to the Minister all three children of and L.

She had been attending classes with the idea of getting her grade and eventual grade XII. She apparently exhibited symptoms of ADD and was referred for medical diagnosis which found there to be ADD. Since the birth of the children, they had been removed from the home to protect them from violence and disharmony in the home when drank. One of the foster parents was in good health and had had years to develop the ability and willingness to properly supervise or protect the children. She was in denial of this or to excuse it. HELD: The application was reserved. 1)The mother was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm to both children. 2)She did not have the competency to parent the children on her own.  3)The father was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for sexual assault.  4)The court found that the mother was incapable of supervising or protecting the children from the domestic violence that had been part of the ongoing pattern of living of and and L and that if the mother remained separated from the mother, domestic violence would not be a factor in the future. She simply could not parent one of the 3 children.  5)The Department was ordered to order the children permanently committed to their father."

The Crown contended that the Chambers judge misinterpreted the definition of custody in granting the application, as the appellant was on day parole at the time of the application.

The Court of Appeal was asked to determine whether any other case law was available in addition to that cited in the 679 decision. Counsel for the Crown argued this is a case of first impression raising issues raised by a panel of the Court and raised the following grounds: 1) whether the Chambers judge erred in law in ruling the appellant, at the time the application was made, was 'in custody' within the meaning of s.679 of The Criminal Code.

The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 771 for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into the accused. The accused was charged with four offences with respect to a twelve year old girl who allegedly occurred during the month of December 1997.

He mistakenly believed that his responsibilities or liability ended with his first appearance in Court following his release. Certainly he was not aware that he himself could be subject to imprisonment under s.773 in the event of default and was not made aware of that fact. 2)Although the accused's conduct may be considered blameworthy or reckless if one accepts his version and deserving of some sanction, the circumstances have concluded that forfeiture should not be ordered against him.

e_2001skqb466.txt,"The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The defendant placed in issue whether it was liable to the plaintiff for the injuries she sustained in the slip and fall and the degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable. 2)The plaintiff met the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor of the store. Some of the injuries were at least in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. 3)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water or produce on a floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. The defendants have most often based the duty of care upon the invitor/invitee standard. In Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs Ltd. (1991), 1991 CanLII 7734 (SK QB), Maurice J. proposed a four part inquiry to determine whether there was a breach of the duty to an invitee. 4)The evidence of the two assistant managers employed at the store confirmed the cleaning regimen in place at the Superstore and there were many cases where slippery substances were found in the vicinity of where the plaintiff fell.

While taking the appellant to where the incident occurred, the officer noted slight smell of alcohol and bloodshot eyes. The appellant failed the ALERT test and refused the breathalyzer. The refusal charge was dismissed and the appellant was convicted of impaired driving. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The evidence of impairment was too weak to convict the appellant. The officer told the accused that if he passed the ALERT test, he would be sent on his way. Thus, she must not have thought that the appellant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired. Failure to act cannot be considered by the trial judge as part of the reasonable and probable grounds.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction quashed. The trial judge did not address fully the various indicia of impaired driving beyond the findings that the accused had been drinking, had a very slight accident, and failed the SL-2. The officer had failed in his testimony to give evidence of the words used in the breathalyzer demand. The evidence was weak to the point where there was virtually no choice but to acquit."

At issue was whether there a change of circumstances, which would warrant a variation of the 2002 child support order; whether the 18 year old continued to be a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act; does the father have an obligation to contribute to his daughter's riding lessons; the father's income for child support purposes; should the 17 year old son's s.7 expenses be increased; costs. HELD: 1)The daughter had ceased to be a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and the father's obligation to provide on-going support and his contribution for s.7 expenses relating to her riding lesson terminated in March 2003. 2)The father shall pay $308 per month for support of his son commencing April 1, 2003 and every month thereafter so long as he remains a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 3)The mother's application to increase the father's contribution for the son's extracurricular activities was dismissed.

HELD: The child was to continue her s. 7(f) hockey, golf and baseball expenses until September 2003. The father's proportionate share of the child support application was reduced to 55.57%. Costs provided some relief to the parties. 1)The child was not a party to the marriage. She was employed full-time earning $8.50 per hour. She required financial support in the interim so that she could save money to go to school and pay off a debt to SGI. 2)The father's income has decreased since the May 2002 order because he was laid off his employment.

There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial. Stay of proceedings granted. At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.","This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter.

He retained counsel and was prepared to fight the merits of the case at trial. The Defense had verbalized an intention to raise s. 8 and s9 Charter motions and lead evidence to the contrary.

The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions. However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.","The accused was charged with impaired operation of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code.

The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered.

e_2005skpc8.txt,"The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The complainant was employed as a clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and although she testified that she knew of the accused in 1999, it was much more likely that she met him in the spring of 2002 after he assumed his duties as Justice of the Peace in the same building. HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of both charges. Although the complainant's version of the incident in the general office differed significantly from the accused's, the same cannot be said about the events of August 2003."

The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking.

e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10 (b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. HELD: The appeal is allowed. 1) The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer. 2) The trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Prosper [1994] 3 S.C.R. 236 in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. 3) In reviewing the evidence that was before the learned trial judge, the judge could not have reasonably reached the conclusion he did. The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated. Impatient, probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about five minutes. 4) Having reviewed the evidence on appeal, the Crown submits that the trial judge erred in his application of Prosper to the case before him, not only because the accused was obviously frustrated and agreed to provide the sample without first talking to lawyer after these attempts were made, but also because the fact that the evidence may not be available as result of a long delay is factor to be considered. 5) The holding of off from trying to elicit incriminating evidence from a detainee in jurisdictions where no duty counsel is available at the time of request, and where the detainee has been sufficiently diligent upon being informed of the right to counsel to trigger and sustain his or her ensuing rights under the Charter, is consistent with the underlying purposes of s.10(b). 6) The respondent's right to an unequivocal waiver of his right to immediate free legal advice, but to advise detainees of the existence and availability of the applicable systems of duty counsel and Legal Aid in that jurisdiction, must not be turned into an obligation on detainees to seek advice of a lawyer."
e_2006skqb534.txt,"The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.","The respondent applies to vary the child support orders of Mr. Justice Kraus dated September 10, 1999 and December 7, 2003 and/or the alleged agreement struck by the petitioner and respondent in or about July 2003. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The respondent did not seek a variation earlier than concluding that the respondent accepted $380.00 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 until July 2006. To order retroactive support of $4,322.00, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category.  2) The petitioner did not engage in blameworthy conduct. The respondent's failure to disclose her tax return on June 30, 2004 and each subsequent year constituted a breach of their alleged 2003 agreement. 3) There was no agreement or obligation to disclose. 4) When considering the circumstances of Meghan and Ryan over the same period of years, 2003 to 2005, no evidence was provided that their standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. 5) The parties negotiated through their lawyers, as well as the respondent personally discussing the matter of reviewing child support. 6) The increase in the respondent's income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. The probability of hardship which might be occasioned if a court ordered retroactive adjustment of child support is reduced given the current circumstances of the child."

He is now facing additional allegations of breach.

The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan. Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability.

HELD: The application was granted. The court found that allowing him a reasonably frugal family lifestyle, which is what he has, will not permit him to pay the liabilities for the loan. Using the Superintendent's Standards he may have a monthly surplus of about $170. It would take many years for him to contribute enough to significantly reduce this liability.

Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","The appellant was a student at St. Francis Xavier University when he sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the professor did not take the content of the attachment as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to the professor to cause his death contrary to s.264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The appellant did not have a lawyer when he stood his trial on May 14, 2008 in Provincial Court. He was found guilty and was sentenced immediately following the conclusion of his trial to an 18 month suspended sentence and placed on probation with conditions. Counsel was retained and an appeal commenced from conviction and sentence, alleging improper admission of evidence, unfair and prejudicial cross-examination of the appellant and a failure to give due consideration to a conditional discharge.

e_2009skca40.txt,"This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","This was an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant sought to set aside the transaction under various heads of contract law including duress, undue influence, unconscionability, equitable fraud and mistake. The trial judge made critical findings of fact, including comprehension and desire to provide benefit to the appellant, including the candid admissions of the appellant in her testimony at trial. The appeals against both the Clements and the solicitors were dismissed. In those circumstances it is impossible for us as a court of appeal to interfere with these findings, even had we wished to. On these facts no possible attack on the contract exists."
e_2010skca79.txt,"The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. The appellant appealed his convictions and his sentence arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter too severe. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons. 1)When the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was alerted to them and were able to place particular reliance on an assessment of the appellant's credibility made by an R.C.M.P. officer who questioned him about possible involvement in the grow-op. 2)The trial judge re-charged the jury on a common sense basis and asked them to consider whether it was likely that the appellant could have outrun the driver of the Tempo. The jury was advised that the Crown was entitled to introduce both pictures because both had been shown to Constable Badger before the search. She did not believe the jury would see them as being mug shots. 3)The appellant's argument that the trial judge left the jury with an erroneous sense of their significance was not supported by the evidence. The trial judge erred in the fact that the photographs were taken when the appellant had been arrested in connection with a prior incident. The conviction appeals and the sentence appeals were dismissed."
e_2011skqb134.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of using credit card data to fraudulently obtain services contrary to s. 342(3) of the Criminal Code, one count of fraud over $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1) of the Criminal Code for defrauding Sasktel of telephone services and one count of fraudulently personating various persons with intent to gain advantage for himself contrary to s. 403(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences. The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names. He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services. The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44. The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items. The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18. The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail. He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders. In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities. He plead guilty. HELD: A fit sentence in global terms for these offences would be 8 years and 6 months. The accused was given credit for 4 years and 9 months for the time he spent in custody. The accused was sentenced to 2 years and 3 months for the s. 342(3) offence, 1 year and 6 months consecutive for the offence under s. 380(1) and 2 years concurrent for the personation offence under s. 403(a). The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","HELD: The accused was sentenced to two years and three months in prison. The global sentence was increased to eight years and six months. The accused pleaded guilty to two counts of fraudulently and without a licence contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and one count of defrauding Saskatchewan Telecommunications of services and goods of a value exceeding $5,000.  1)The gravity of the offences was very high because of a number of aggravating circumstances. 2)There was pre-meditation and careful planning in advance. Several other people were implicated in the criminal enterprise. The two schemes were pursued over a lengthy period of time and involved scores of transactions.  3)Denunciation and deterrence, both of the accused and others, which must be emphasized and obtain a priority. 4)The accused plead guilty.  5)Costs of incarceration for 2 years and 3 months, concurrent with the preceding sentences.  6)The quantum of time spent on remand was 1,336 days and cannot be attributed to the accused. The credit should be one for one or put otherwise, the time actually served by the accused in the years 2008 and 2009 were brought about because of the time constraints which necessarily are a part of the process.  7)There should be a credit of four years and nine months and the global sentence should be reduced accordingly."
e_2011skqb244.txt,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","The appellant appeals his conviction for impaired care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s.253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, fined him $1,000 and prohibited him from driving for one year. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)The learned trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt sufficient evidence of impairment to meet the standard set out in the Stellato decision. 2)The trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count. The Crown had not been informed of the right to counsel when the tests were performed. The trial judge did not err in his treatment of the evidence of the appellant's lawyer. 3)The appellant's evidence of slurred speech while the appellant was detained and prior to being afforded the right of counsel was inadmissible. The appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to take into account the fact that the appellant had a bloodshot red eye, flushed face, and a strong smell of alcohol on his breath was not supported by the appellant’s evidence. 4)The appeal was dismissed. 5)The Court of Appeal reviewed several recent appellate court decisions as to when the results of roadside sobriety tests can be used for the purpose of proof of an offence or for challenging the credibility of an accused. The Court held that if the McKenzie threshold of evidence is still the law, a conviction for impairment could never be made unless the degree of impairment was great. This is clearly inconsistent with the decision and reasoning in Stellerato."

The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the penitentiary at approximately 8:30 p.m. on September 1, 2008. The accused and the two alleged victims were inmates at the prison and were being held on a range designated for gang members. Given that the incident was captured by security videos, there is no doubt as to what happened. The issues raised by the accused pertain to how his actions ought to be characterized. The s. 34(2) defence is to deal with the argument that the accused's actions against the victims were done in self-defence as contemplated by s.34(2)."
e_2012skpc161.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","The accused pleaded guilty to aggravated assault thereby endangering the victim contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence that he report to his youth worker. HELD: The accused was sentenced to a secure custodial sentence of 24 months to be followed by a period of probation followed by 6 months of community supervision. The accused will be permanently disabled as a result of the offence. Mitigating factors were the egregious nature of the assault, including repeated blows with a weapon and the resulting serious harm done to the victim, his record of findings of guilt, while not particularly reflective of violence, indicates lack of compliance with court orders. Mitigation was the early guilty plea, thereby saving the complainant the additional anguish of having to testify at a trial. The young person was cooperative with police and provided a statement. The Court had little confidence that the young person would successfully comply with conditions, if probation alone were imposed, given his history of non-compliance."

e_2013skca1.txt,"The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","The proposed appellants sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) striking the within action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and non-client. The representative plaintiff alleged that he and other investors purchased cells based on the representation by Royal Crown that the purchase price could be deducted from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes. Royal Crown brought an action against the appellants, challenging the Chambers judge's certification order and his dismissal of the application. The chambers judge dismissed the application and certified the action as a class action against all defendants. The appellants then applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000, s. 42.1 and Rule 49 of the Court's Rule 49 for an order granting them leave to appeal from the certification order or his dismissal. HELD: The proposed appeal was granted or withheld in consideration of merit and importance as follows: 1) the proposed appeal is prima facie destined to fail and not of sufficient merit to warrant the attention of this Court; 2) the court must consider whether the claim of negligence as a common issue predominates over other issues affecting individual members of the class and 3) the Court must consider the factors set out in Rothmans, Benson Hedges, and Rothmans. The criteria to be considered in leave applications were articulated by Cameron J.A. in Rothman, Benson & Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan, 2002 SKCA 119 (CanLII), 227 Sask. R. 121, and are well known to counsel. The Court held that the common issues would do nothing to advance the class because they were all predicated on a flawed premise that had no foundation in fact. The losses the plaintiffs alleged in that case were based on flawed premise and were caused by the defendant's negligence. These facts, coupled with case law stating a lawyer may owe a duty of caring to a non- client and the evidence of Mr. Davies, establish a common area which appears to meet the requirements of the Class Actions Act.  4) the factual base pled by the plaintiff does not establish a standard issue which meets the commonality requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of the Act. 5) The Court relied on the decision in Re: Collections Inc.' v. Toronto Dominion Bank, 2010 ONSC 6560. 6) and 7) the fact that the defendant pled not guilty to the charge of negligence but rather plead not guilty."
e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent seeks to vary two orders issued in 1998 and 2001. He wants to expunge the arrears in respect of each and also seeks a declaration that their three children are no longer children of the marriage. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The court found that the respondent did not have the ability to pay child support.  2) The respondent was ordered to pay $1,683 in monthly child support, $176,738 and $9,562 respectively.  3) The Court did not accept the respondent’s argument that his child support obligations should be calculated using the income he actually earned.  4) The petitioner was not able to work as a registered nurse until she upgraded her education. She was 63 years old and suffering from anxiety and depression. The respondent had not been paying child support for some time. He was putting money away for his retirement. He did not mention that he was trying to retire in the next few years. He said that he would like to continue to work into his eighties. 5) There was no agreement as to how much child support the respondent should have paid under the 2001 and 2001 orders. The Court found that it was impossible to determine the amount of child support owed by the respondent. 6) It was not necessary to comment on the other factors set out in Wurmlinger and D.B.S. 7. 8."
e_2016skpc30.txt,"HELD: The accused was granted a curative discharge. The court found that the accused had met the required onus of this type of application in accordance with R. v. Ahenakew. The accused’s conduct over the past 18 months satisfied the court on the balance of probabilities that hers was an exceptional case and that a curative discharge would not be contrary to the public interest. The court imposed numerous conditions on her, including that she could not have or consume alcohol and should report to a probation officer, receive addiction counselling, participate in AA meetings and provide proof of her attendance to her probation officer.

They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.",The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother of the two children. The father seeks an order that he have custody of the children. He is not opposed to the grandmother having reasonable and liberal access with the children but her home be the children's primary residence.

The court ordered that the father pay child support for the children for three weekends in a row with no access on the fourth weekend. The grandmother's access was ordered to be supervised by his aunt.
