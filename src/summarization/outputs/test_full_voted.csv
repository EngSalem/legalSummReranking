b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice.

Since Mr. Butler filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order pursuant to Part II of the 2009 Act.

She deposed to having purchased a five ton truck from the RPS in 2007 for $16,000. After paying the down payment, Mr. Metz repaid the balance of the balance ($11,000) in cash periodically over the course of the ensuing years in lump sums of $1,000 or more. 4)The Director's application was based on the expiration of the limitation period.

3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT: The father was ordered to pay child support of $600 per month. He applied to reduce his support obligation and rescind arrears. HELD: 1) The father's decision to work only three months of the year and return to school is not a reasonable decision when he has a continuing obligation to provide support for his child.  2) On all of the evidence, the father's choice to work a minimum amount each year and, if he should return, it will be his choice to attend school and severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time.  3) The court ordered costs as against the father for the additional legal expenses associated with having to submit motions to the court in order to force him to disclose financial information. 4) The Court ordered that any sharing of s.7 special expenses should be based on the applicant's imputed income of $40,000. The father is underemployed and has not obtained full-time employment with another employer. The court found that the father had made an impulsive and unprofessional decision and that he was not acting in good faith. 5) The child support application was commenced in June of 2002 and the father applied for and received an order for sharing of the expenses relating to extracurricular activities in proportion to the parties' income. He was also required to provide additional financial disclosure to the Court. 6) The application was adjourned sine die with direction to return the matter to court once the grievance filed by Mr. Pilat concerning his termination from Ipsco was determined by an arbitrator. 7) The applicant's income is imputed to be the sum of $20,000 and he must pay $328 per month as and for the support of the child. Based on this income the father is entitled to child support.","Mr. Pilat applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind arrears which have accumulated under Archambault J.’s order. [22] On all of the evidence I find it is Mr. Pilat\'s choice to work a minimum amount each year and, if he should return to school, it will be his choice to attend school and severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. Mr. Pilat\'s decision to work only three months of the year and/or return to school is not a reasonable decision when he has a continuing obligation to provide support for his child, Stephanie.

HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances.

Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure.

The parents of one child were ordered to pay tax deductible child support of $600 per month as support for the child. The father applied to reduce his support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under the previous order. HELD: 1) The father was to pay child support retroactive to September 1, 2002. Based on all of the evidence, it was clear that the father had not vigorously pursued employment opportunities since his termination with Ipsco. Based upon the father's current income and the fact that he had not obtained full-time employment with another employer, the Court ordered costs as against the father for the additional legal expenses associated with having to submit motions to the court in order to force the father to disclose financial information.  2) The court found that the Father's financial position had not changed as result of the order for child support.

6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","HELD: The plaintiff sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She says that Ms. Mui and RE/MAX Saskatoon fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. She also says that the defendants, who remained parties to the action, were negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff also claims aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski and Trevi Holdings Ltd., asserting that their acts and omissions exacerbated her distress. In the event that any defects existed, the defendants say that they were patent, and that the law of caveat emptor applies.  1) The plaintiff purchased a country home in 1998. It was owned by the defendants. Their realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, the owner of the last defendant, Trev Holdings Ltd. 2) The house did not meet the plaintiff’s expectations. She now sues them for recovery of the damages for latent defects. The realtor and company are liable to her in negligence and as party to the misrepresentations made by the plaintiff.  3) The court ordered the plaintiff to pay $250,000 for the house and $350,000 in general damages, including damages based upon mental and emotional distress, to all defendants.  4) The Court ordered the defendant to pay the sum of $1.5 million for the home.  5) The defendant was liable to the plaintiff in the amount of $400,000.  6) There was no discussion of home inspection.  7) The date of the sale was not set out in the Corrigendum.  8) In 1998, the plaintiff purchased the property for $299,000 with possession date of August 6, 1999. The property was listed for sale at $265,000 but was taken off the market until 1999 when the defendant relisted it.  9) The first time the plaintiff visited the property in 1998, she attended at the request of one of her daughters. She did not know that the house had been moved to its present location.  10) The second time, in 1999, she went to the property with her husband, who was a journeyman plumber. He was there for less than 20 minutes. He did not appear to be paying any attention to the details of the property.  11) In 1999, the defendant and his company entered into a confidential agreement","She says that Ms. Mui and RE/MAX Saskatoon fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, according to Ms. Schira, similarly misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently, both in information given to her which induced her, in part, to purchase the home, and in answers that they gave in a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. 106) With the above in mind, I have determined that certain of the evidence of each of Mr. Karpinski, Mrs. Karpinski and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. I have, accordingly, accepted the observations of Mr. Loraas and the opinions of Mr. Epp. 123) In considering the liability of each of the defendants I have, as previously noted, accepted the conclusions and opinions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp. In particular, I find:
(i) The pine shakes were rotting and many were cracked to such an extent that water could permeate the underlying joints and decking. 130) In this case, I have concluded that Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski did not speak “truthfully and completely” when answering all the questions in the PCDS. However, given their lack of veracity on key issues, I do not accept that they were unaware of other water and moisture damage, whether arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or inadequate venting that was occurring elsewhere in the interior of the house. Accordingly I find Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski liable to Ms. Schira for breach of contract for failing to disclose in questions B, F and G of the PCDS the existence of structural defects, damage due to water, and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the Karpinskis and Ms. Schira, and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. For reasons already set out, I would find that the false representations knowingly made by Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, and their silence as to material facts, were fraudulent. I have concluded that Ms. Mui was negligent and that her conduct and advice to Ms. Schira fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. Further, had Ms. Mui fulfilled her obligation first to disclose all material facts to Ms. Schira, and second, to explain and, in these circumstances, recommend a home inspection, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the outcome for Ms. Schira would have been different. 148) I am satisfied however that Mr. Jacobucci is liable to Ms. Schira for negligent misrepresentation. I award Ms. Schira $15,000 as compensation for the personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the house. However, there is no evidence that the distress that she experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness. Conclusion 176) While Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski are liable for breach of contract, each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to Ms. Schira, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. 1. Ms. Schira shall have judgment against the defendants in the amount of $49,608.87. 2. Ms. Schira is entitled to pre-judgment interest under The Pre-Judgment Interest Act, S.S. 1984-85-86, c. P-22.2 calculated from February 8, 2000. 1. Ms. Schira shall have judgment against the defendants in the amount of $49,608.87.",0.42544731610337977,0.36823529411764705,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed.

The property did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. HELD: 1) The home was not within the plaintiff’s means. The realtor was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. 2) The property was too expensive for the plaintiff to afford. The search for suitable home expanded to acreages in the neighbouring environs. 3) The first time the plaintiff visited the property, she was interested in a wood-paneled home heated by wood. She wanted to ensure that there was also a gas line onto the property. She asked the realtor to find out if she could rely on the PCDS. 4) The second time she visited the home she was more concerned about the state of the home than the actual condition of it. The PCDS would reveal to her any conditions of the property that were not readily apparent. There was no discussion about home inspection.

7_2001nssc49.txt,"The parties were divorced two years ago and the matter had been finalized by an appeal decision in June, 1999. Both parties made application to vary child support on the basis of changes (ups and downs) in the farming business. The respondent wife, who recently purchased a house, also applied for lump sum spousal support which claim had been disallowed by the Court of Appeal. Monthly spousal support terminated as wife now self-sufficient; child support increased due to increase in husband's income; lump sum payment of $8,000 awarded to wife to help pay her relocation expenses from move with husband given six months to pay lump sum, but monthly spousal support to continue until the $8,000 was paid in full. Applications to vary should not be entertained simply because of the usual ups and downs of the farming business; the court must strive to average out the individual's ability to pay in such circumstances in order to ensure stability of payments for both parties. Lump sum spousal support payments must not have the effect of a significant redistribution of the division of matrimonial property but the reasons for the belated application must be examined.","The parties applied to vary spousal and/or child support less than 2 years after being divorced and less than one year after the Court of Appeal decision which settled the support awards of the trial judge. HELD: 1) The parties had made counter applications to vary the spousa and child support.  2) The respondent's income for support purposes was $41,000 and he was to pay child support of $567.00 per month in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guides. The respondent sought a lump sum award of $8,000 to compensate the respondent for her relocation expenses. She also sought to increase child support at the current level, at least to 2002, and $10,000 per year for moving expenses.  3) Costs were to be determined based on the respondent's net average income over the past eight years for the purposes of paying'regular' and dependable child support, and the income tax consequences of cashing in RRSP's and other expenses such as furniture would to some extent be an expense, although understand the intention of the respondent is to reinstate those expenses.","[1] The parties have made counter applications to vary spousal and/or child support and lump sum spousal support less than two years after being divorced and less than one year after the Court of Appeal decision which settled the support awards of the trial judge. She also seeks a lump sum support payment of $20,000.00 to reimburse her for the RRSP’s she cashed for the down payment on a home and for moving expenses, etc. [2] This proceeding involves applications to vary the Corollary Relief Judgement dated November 16, 1998, resulting from the trial decision of Justice Hall dated October 1, 1998, and the Court of Appeal decision dated June 4, 1999. However, I would be loathe to entertain applications to vary, simply on the basis of the usual ups and downs of the farming business. Otherwise the effect could be a significant redistribution of the matrimonial property division. [20] In the circumstances I find there is a current need for a lump sum award to compensate Ms. MacDonald for her relocation expenses for the reasons mentioned above. Considering the moving expenses and the tax consequences of cashing some RRSP’s and other expenses such as furniture, etc., I find a lump sum spousal support award of $8,000.00 is warranted. [24] In the final analysis, I find that Ms. MacDonald has now achieved self-sufficiency. Having said that, I would not terminate spousal support entirely until the $8,000.00 lump sum is paid because that money is required by Ms. MacDonald to meet her immediate requirements created by the need for the lump sum.

The respondent wife, who recently purchased a house, also applied for lump sum spousal support which claim had been disallowed by the Court of Appeal.

The parties originally claimed material change in circumstances based on his poor farming results in 1999 and Ms. Macdonald's improved employment and income situation. The trial judge awarded $10,000 lump sum spousals to the parties and ordered that the parties pay $8,000 per month in child support until the lump sum award is paid. Both parties have not addressed the question of costs directly pending the Court's decision. HELD: 1) The court reviewed the farming income over the years and also the family's and Mr. Vermeulen's standard of living and concluded it would be reasonable to impute or set the respondent's income at $30,000 for support purposes. 2) The respondent has now achieved self-sufficiency. The evidence was that if the respondent took certain training courses through the Bank, she would be paid while training and would receive substantial increase in pay. There was no evidence that she required money for retraining. 3) In the circumstances the respondent has not established an immediate need for a lump sum in support. The court has also considered the lump-sum spousa award which has been ordered. 4) The parties have made no effort to vary the Corollary Relief Judgement dated November 16, 1998. The Court ordered support of $250 per month, effective April 1, 2001, subject to the conditions set out in the order. This amount shall be payable on or before October 30, 2001. 5) It would appear that the court clearly contemplated that the respondent could make an application to vary when she moved and purchased her own home. She has successfully completed her job related courses and her income has increased by 71% in two years. Her income is at the bottom of her salary range. Indications are that she is very capable and there is no reason to believe she will not continue to progress. 6) Costs are not an easy thing to determine because he is a farmer subject to his business. Pin point accuracy is not possible. If the answer to question is yes, one must strive to average or even out the applicant's ability to pay.","[1] The parties have made counter applications to vary spousal and/or child support and lump sum spousal support less than two years after being divorced and less than one year after the Court of Appeal decision which settled the support awards of the trial judge.

Punishment should be mitigated by the defendant's lesser degree of culpability and not arranging for an alternative to use the pit, alternatives that did exist on the farm at the time. It is material to me as well that the evidence in Exhibit 1, containing diagrams and photographs of the farm, and the submissions of Mr. Yuill, indicate clearly that the defendant was conscientious about safety issues before August 13 2006 and has endeavored to address and improve safety at his farm since that time. He has made substantial improvements to the dairy farm since August 2006, including constructing a dairy barn, including a safer method for disposing of manure, through gravity fed tightly spaced gratings that Mr. Sutherland designed himself. His failure was in not securing the damaged barricade while a new one was on order, or arranging for a alternative to using the pit. HELD: The joint recommendation of counsel for a total penalty of $25,000 is appropriate in this case. 1) The defendant was responsible enough to show up for his job at the Sutherland dairy farm. He probably should not have gone to work in his condition but he did, perhaps because he was not the kind of young man to let an employer down by not showing up. 2) The Court was satisfied that the Court was cognizant of the mitigating factors that apply in the case of the accident and the steps he had taken since the accident to improve safety. The Court accepted the submission that a $25k penalty is a significant penalty.","[1] Mark Sutherland owns and operates a family dairy farm. Mr. Sutherland’s guilty plea relates to the fact that on August 13, 2006, there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. He drowned in a manure pit. Mr. Sutherland ’s failure was in not securing the manure pit which had its damaged barricade removed while a new one was on order, or not arranging for an alternative to using the pit, alternatives that did exist on the farm at the time. Other factors that are relevant to the issue of proportionality in this case are the fact that Mr. Sutherland is before me as an individual not a large corporation and the fact that Mr. Boake also had responsibilities under the Occupational Health and Safety Act that he did not meet. [9] The principle of parity in sentencing requires that ""a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances"", but this case does not lend itself easily to comparisons. I am satisfied that the joint recommendation of counsel for a total penalty of $25,000 is appropriate in this case. I accept the submission that a $25,000 penalty is a significant penalty for Mr. Sutherland. [13] I am going to direct that the fine portion of the penalty be paid, as is jointly recommended, to the Canadian Farmers’ Disability Registry. In addition I am directing that Mr. Sutherland perform 160 hours community service specifically with respect to farm safety, including preparation and travel to meetings associated with the issue.",0.5183016105417277,0.38010657193605685,"The defendant, who owned and operated a family dairy farm, pleaded guilty to an offence under the Occupational Health and Safety Act for failing to take every precaution that is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons at the workplace. The guilty plea relates to the fact that on August 13, 2006, one of his employees, Gary Boake, died in an accident at the farm. The defendant's responsibility to safeguard employees from risks associated with that manure pit arises under s. 13(1) of the Act. His blood alcohol concentration was significantly over the legal limit for operating any kind of vehicle.

The parties litigated the apportionment of custody and access rights and the quantification of child support and special expenses for their two children. HELD: Costs of $3,000 were assessed against the respondent. Costs were assessed at rate of $150 per month until paid in full. 1) The parties' initiative in seeking to vary the existing order was not reasonable and responsible. 2) Income was imputed to the respondent by the Court. He did not persuade the Court to reduce his child support obligation. It is my conclusion that Mr. Williams's submissions needlessly resulted in the expenditure of time and effort by all involved and delayed the issuance of an order.",0.5

The salary was calculated on the premise his annual salary was $102,000, not $110,000. He resisted the attribution on pragmatic grounds arguing that the company had not paid him any salary; that there was no guarantee the company was going to earn profit; that it needed working capital; and so on. Finally, he contended that attributing even the net income to him for the purpose of mitigation would be inconsistent with Foster v. MTI Canada Ltd. (an unreported decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal dated July 16, 1992). HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The trial judge did not err in determining the period of notice to which Mr. Larsen was entitled at common law to disregard all but his year of service with STC. Any other approach could have been inconsistent with precedent. 2)Costs for the trial judge were set aside. The Crown Employment Contracts Act set aside the contractual provisions for payment on dismissal contained in all Crown contracts including those of Crown corporations and directed instead that payment be determined in accordance with common law principle. With that in mind he calculated that the loss was of no moment. The evidence was convincing: Larsen at the time of his dismissal was a career civil servant, skilled and dedicated."" 3)The severance terms of the contract were arrived at with an eye to his earlier service. Indeed they were inserted on the premises he had been in the service of the Crown since February 1, 1982, the day he joined Sask.

HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The plaintiff brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order requiring the defendant to serve pre-certification notices to all persons who travelled with the plaintiff during the purposed class. The plaintiff brought two separate notices of motion. The first was for the plaintiff to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant (relating to test of their premises for contamination). The second motion sought to have the defendant Red Seal to provide the plaintiff with list of names, addresses, telephone numbers and other information relevant to the proposed class. Red Seal opposed the certification application (i.e. the defendant did not file an affidavit as opposed to providing their own evidence). HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The Court's inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised judicially and only when the relief sought cannot reasonable and realistically be obtained by the applications in some other lawful manner. 2) It is important to note that the usual practices and application of the common law regarding civil litigation apply. The practices and the implementation of The Rules of Court apply. This is still an 'action' and not a 'class action'. The plaintiff is entitled to file a response affidavit within three days of the filing of the motion. 3) The court is not prepared to broaden the scope of Ottenbreit J.’s decision to allow for examination of Ms. Moore. There are a number of situations in which the Court has jurisdiction to make orders prior to certification of the proceedings as a class action. The usual practices, the practice and implementation of the Rule of Law apply. 4) The application is dismissed for failure to produce proper representative plaintiff. 5) The actual purpose of examining the plaintiff is not to challenge her version of the circumstances leading up to the signing of the alleged settlement agreements by the Roussys. The defendant could not rely on s. 14 prior to certifying the action as class action, but rather a more general and broad ranging interrogation of the plaintiff about other customers who may have booked through her office with Red Seal at the relevant time of this case. The examination may even end up being more broad ranging than that and could be an attempt to get information from Red Seal itself as to its customer data base that may have been booked through Red Seal. 6) There is nothing in the conduct of class action proceedings to interfere with what otherwise would be the normal rights of parties to conduct their affairs as they see fit.","Indeed Ottenbreit J. directed that the only thing the plaintiffs could do was to file a reply affidavit within three days. 17) In my view it is not reasonable for the MLG several weeks after the deadline for filing the reply affidavit to embark on a totally different approach (i.e. examining the affidavit as opposed to providing their own evidence). 18) It appears to me that the actual purpose of examining Ms. Moore is not to challenge her version of the circumstances leading up to the signing of the alleged settlement agreements by the Roussys, but rather a more general and broad ranging interrogation of Ms. Moore about other customers who may have booked through her office with Red Seal at the relevant time of this case. 19) Accordingly, based on the plain wording of Justice Ottenbreit J.’s judgment and the context of the preparation of the Moore affidavit; I must dismiss the application for examination on the Moore affidavit.

Finally the Sparvier case appears to be authority that allows the Court to cross examine a defendant on an affidavit. 2) The Court's inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised judicially and only when the relief sought cannot reasonable and realistically be obtained by the applications in some other lawful manner. What would be the purpose of subsection 43(1) if not to include a suspension of the limitation period for actions that are not certified as class action? 3) The plaintiff did not seek through this motion to restrain the defendant from distributing the package nor does it seek to have this court direct Inco to change any portion of the material.

The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted.

Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.","This was an application for an order for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment under Rule 31.01. The plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle and said in her affidavit that she was struck from behind by one of the Defendants named in the motor vehicle accident. The defendant argued there was a significant amount of other factors relating to the health of the plaintiff. HELD: The application was allowed. 1)There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's argument. 2)The plaintiff was making a significant claim yet when one listens to defendant's counsel and reads the material attached to his affidavit, one concludes there are a significant number of other issues relating to her health. 3)Judgement is entered against the respondent/defendant as to liability with damages to be assessed. 4)A further burden of proof, and considerably heavier one, falls on the defendant.","[1] This is an application for an Order for summary judgement pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13 and an interim payment under Civil Procedure Rule 31.01.

In my opinion to assess any amount in this case at this point in time would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess.

The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee.

Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The plaintiff was retained to act as general counsel to and to the project.

In mid-1987, the second mortgagee, the Crowne Plaza developer, indicated willingness to inject more money into the project but that the creditors and suppliers were withdrawing support.

Any claim under this ground is therefore dismissed.","The plaintiffs have also raised an allegation of breach of trust on the part of Mr. Brookes; however, there is no evidence Mr. Brookes was ever in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs, nor was he ever retained by the plaintiffs or purport in any way to act for them or on their behalf.

Therefore, on this basis there can be no reliance by these latter creditors and it is impossible to see how they could have a claim for breach of an undertaking which is not communicated or directed to them before they provided their services or materials.

In my respectful opinion, in the case at bar, one cannot interpret Mr. Brookes\' letter of March 11, 1987 in the abstract or in a vacuum and one must consider all of the surrounding circumstances, including the knowledge of the plaintiffs, through the Creditors\'Committee and their representatives, the letters of March 12, March 13 and March 16, 1987 and the various meetings resulting in those letters.

The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The plaintiffs sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation and breach of trust. The defendants had provided the defendant with three irrevocable letters of direction requiring him to pay mortgage brokerage fees and an apparently unacknowledged letter of direction for the payment of mortgage proceeds upon the signature of certain individuals only. The defendant was retained to act as general counsel to and to the project and disburse funds from mortgage advances. The project was financially tight from the very beginning and cash flow was continuously problem. During this time, the initial second mortgagee, which had become dissatisfied with the handling of the project funds by one of the principals of and was withdrawing its support, became increasingly concerned that the suppliers were beginning to doubt the viability of The project and the ultimate payment of their accounts. As a result of these developments, the defendant was requested to obtain postponements of the irrevocables of the mortgage advances in order that the funds may be diverted to other creditors. The plaintiff sued the solicitor for failing to comply with these conditions. The plaintiffs have not established the basis for a claim under breaches of trust and cannot succeed on this ground. Any claim under this ground is dismissed.","The plaintiffs have also raised an allegation of breach of trust on the part of Mr. Brookes; however, there is no evidence Mr. Brookes was ever in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs, nor was he ever retained by the plaintiffs or purport in any way to act for them or on their behalf.

A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","The accused was originally charged with second degree murder with regard to the death of his cousin. He pled guilty to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so. The Crown presented six victim impact statements of the siblings of the victim and four of his brothers; collectively marked as Exhibit P12. The accused was on mandatory firearm prohibition at the time of the offence. Notwithstanding that firearm prohibition he willingly accepted a firearm from niece to hunt rabbits and prairie chicken. He has shown no remorse since he in drunken stupor shot his cousin in the head for no apparent reason. HELD: A global sentence of 10 years was appropriate in this case to be served in a federal institution on the manslaughter conviction.  1) Although s. 743.6(1) of the Criminal Code has sometimes been treated by the courts as'separate and distinct' offence, in the circumstances of this case and as agreed by counsel for the Crown and defence the Court is prepared to impose a concurrent sentence of one year to the ten year sentence the Court has imposed for the manslaughter.  2) The Court reviewed all of the cases provided to it by counsel but, in particular, the three cases the Crown is primarily relying upon in support of its position that a 15 year sentence is appropriate in the province of Saskatchewan. 3) Although the Crown provided the Court with multiple cases, the Court was not satisfied that the expression of society's denunciation of the offences or objective of specific or general deterrence so requires, order that the portion of sentence that must be served before the offender may be released on full parole is one half of the sentence or ten years, whichever is less. There may very well be restorative programs available that Gordon would be suitable for that could not be accessed if the Court made an order.","[16] On the other hand there is one huge mitigating factor and that is the multiple Gladue factors relevant to Gordon taken as a whole.

HELD: 1) Although the Crown provided the Court with multiple cases, the Court was not prepared to impose an order pursuant to s. 743.6(1) of the Criminal Code primarily as a result of the Court having to recognize the multiple Gladue factors in this case that have to be addressed.

The mother and father lived together as common-law spouses from January 2005 until January 2016. After the mother's separation from the father in February 2014, the parties' second child, Haydn, was born while the father was living with the grandmother. The relationship between the father and the children had deteriorated over the years and the father now lived in the grandmother's home. The grandmother has a blood tie to the children, as seven of his nine years in the home have been spent living with her. She opposed the father's claim for custody and requested that the children be designated beneficiaries of any life insurance, pension plan or health care plan he owned. In addition, the grandmother indicated that she would have the right to be provided with all information regarding medical care, counselling, educational issues directly from the care providers or the school or educational institution in the same manner as a parent with sole custody would have.

Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded.

In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused.

The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible.

The appeal must not be allowed and there is an order of prohibition granted on the reasoning that disclosure by a judge of a judge and a jury or a judge alone, doesn't amount to a disqualification from the Court of Appeal on the principle that inadvertent, inadmissible evidence will not be introduced. The evidence complained of was inadvertently introduced.

6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","At the time of the jury trial, the issue of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench's jurisdiction to deal with entitlement to holiday pay was being determined by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. The plaintiff asserted that the $250.00 portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. In the alternative, the defendant claims that the plaintiff's holiday pay should be based on his wage, plus one-half of his truck expense allowance. HELD: The jury trial was to proceed with respect to the issues of liability and damages, reserving the issue on the basis of his wage and his truck allowance. The defendant asserted that if the court found the plaintiff’s contract was not all-inclusive or that it did not exceed the minimum standards set out in the Labour Standards Act, the plaintiff should only be entitled to recover back to April 1990 as the plaintiff is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act, R.S. s. 1978, c. L-15 which only allows recovery of money under a contract up to 6 years after the cause of action arises. The doctrine of estoppel or waiver should apply to prevent the plaintiff from claiming his holiday pay for 10 years.","Further it asserts that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay, as the plaintiff was a “manager” within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the LSA and therefore not entitled to overtime. [24] Further, the defendant claims that if the court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay, the plaintiff should only be entitled to recover back to April 1990 as the plaintiff is limited by The Limitation of Actions Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. L-15 which only allows recovery of money under a contract up to six years after the cause of action arises.

The jury determined that the plaintiff was constructually dismissed and awarded the plaintiff damages.

The defendant argued that holiday pay should not be included in any computation of holiday pay, as he was a'manager' within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the LSA and therefore not entitled to overtime. 2) The plaintiff's holiday pay was calculated on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance. Any holiday pay owing to the plaintiff will be calculated only on the plaintiff's wage. 3) There were several preliminary issues which must be dealt with at this stage.  4) It would be contrary to public policy for this Court to appear to endorse the defendant's actions by calculating his holiday pay on a rate of $30 per month and then dealing with the issues, both factual and legal, with respect to the claim for unpaid holidays.","Further it asserts that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay, as the plaintiff was a “manager” within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the LSA and therefore not entitled to overtime.

Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay.

The Crown was apparently not even close to being ready to proceed, nor did it give any real explanation for its failure to comply with its self-acknowledged legal obligation to provide disclosure. 3)The Court found no evidence of any particular complexity or difficulty in the application.","He now applies to this court for a remedy pursuant to s. 24 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it.

The defendant had no previous criminal record and was serving the useful social purpose of looking after his ailing mother who lives on an isolated acreage and who will also be punished if he is incarcerated.  2) A conditional sentence would not be a fit sentence on the facts in this matter, although the defendant qualifies for the same to be given to him. He has abided by his release conditions over the past two and half-years, has no prior criminal record, and is now serving a useful social role. He would not endanger the community if one were to be imposed. 3) The Court found that the defendant was not amenable to sex offender programming given the circumstances of the offence and the fact that he disclosed his stories were largely fantasies of what he would do with those two girls when they were under his roof. The Court also found that there was no evidence that he had any criminal record at the time of the offences. 4) The sentence imposed was not appropriate given the defendant's record and the mitigating factors referred to in R. v. Cohen, 144 O.A.C. 340 (C.A.) (CanLII) which upheld conditional sentences of 14 months and 18 months respectively for distribution of child pornography. 5) There were no aggravating factors to consider in the sentencing of the defendant. 6) The court found the defendant to be in the wrong group and ordered that he be subject to an order requiring him to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, 2004, which is the mandatory time specified in s. 490.012(1) for a person convicted of sexually abusing a child.","[1] Mr. Houston pled guilty at the opening of trial to one count of

HELD: 1) The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years. The defendant had no previous criminal record and was serving the useful social purpose of looking after his ailing mother who lives on an isolated acreage and who will also be punished if he is incarcerated.  2) A conditional sentence would not be a fit sentence on the facts in this matter, although the defendant qualifies for the same to be given to him. He has abided by his release conditions over the past two and half-years, has no prior criminal record, and is now serving a useful social role. He would not endanger the community if one were to be imposed. 3) The Court found that the defendant was not amenable to sex offender programming given the circumstances of the offence and the fact that he disclosed his stories were largely fantasies of what he would do with those two girls when they were under his roof. The Court also found that there was no evidence that he had any criminal record at the time of the offences. 4) The sentence imposed was not appropriate given the defendant's record and the mitigating factors referred to in R. v. Cohen, 144 O.A.C. 340 (C.A.) (CanLII) which upheld conditional sentences of 14 months and 18 months respectively for distribution of child pornography. 5) There were no aggravating factors to consider in the sentencing of the defendant. 6) The court found the defendant to be in the wrong group and ordered that he be subject to an order requiring him to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, 2004, which is the mandatory time specified in s. 490.012(1) for a person convicted of sexually abusing a child.",0.4608

Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along Highway #3 in the community of Woods Harbour, Nova Scotia. At the time his driver's license was revoked. The only issue at trial was whether this makes the accused guilty of the offence of driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his licence was revoked contrary to s.287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act. The words'motor vehicle' and 'ruck' are used within the sections of the motor vehicle to determine whether the provision applies to the use of ATV's or other prohibited vehicles. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of dangerous driving on a highway and the charge under s.11 was dismissed.  1)The words'motiv vehicle' in s. 287(2)(a) do not include an ATV and even if those words did, the accused should be found guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an  ATV on the roadway. 2)The word'mobil vehicle' are defined in s2(m) as a driver’s license issued under this act to drive motor vehicle upon the highway.  3)It seems apparent that one must consider the context in which the words “motor Vehicle” are used in the section of the M Vehicle Act to determine if the provisions apply to the uses of ATVs, Vultures or Other prohibited Vehicles. It is argued that the legislature intended for that subsection to prohibit the use by those individuals who had their licences or privilege of obtaining licences to do so cancelled, suspended or revoked. Before one can be guilty of such an offence find that it must be proven that they were driving a vehicle of type or class for which they could properly have beenlicensed to drive on the road. In s.7(2), the words'vehicle' include only those types or classes of vehicles for which one can obtain a license to drive. It seems absurd to suggest that a lawfully licensed driver operating a properly licensed automobile or truck on highway would be liable for violations of the Act such as speeding or imprudent driving, while person operating an off-highway vehicle on highway could not be subject to the same obligations.","These facts were agreed and the only issue at this trial is whether this makes the accused guilty of the offence of driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his license was revoked contrary to s.287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act.

b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","This was an application for directions pursuant to s. 209 of the Saskatchewan Insurance Act. The appellant was the primary insurer as the holder of the blanket fleet coverage of Kellogg. The respondent, Royal, denied coverage and refused to defend the action in the name and on behalf of the insured on the basis of an exclusionary provision in its policy. HELD: The application was heard by a Court of Queen's Bench judge in chambers who ruled Royal was not obligated to participate in defending the action because the Honda involved was not insured by Royal. The two issues to be resolved on appeal were whether the chambers judge erred in his application of the principles of contract interpretation when he decided the Honda was not a 'temporary substitute automobile' within the terms of the policy.","Appeal Dismissed: LANE J.A. This appeal arises from an application for directions made pursuant to s. 209 of The Saskatchewan Insurance Act (""the Act""), R.S.S. 1978, c.S-26. On November 19, 1993, McLeod was involved in a motor vehicle accident. At the time of the accident, McLeod was on company business and was driving his wife's Honda because his company car had a deflated tire. The application was heard by a Court of Queen's Bench judge in chambers who ruled Royal was not obligated to participate in defending the action ""because the Honda involved is not insured by Royal"". Thus having embarked on a wide review of the policy the chambers judge concluded there was no ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs on double Column V.

Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","This was an appeal from an application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend.

e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","HELD: The Court found that the plaintiffs’ claim was an abuse of process. The court found that s. 23 of the Charter gives it an exclusive and unfettered authority to decide whether it will admit any non-greens to attend a fransaskois school in Saskatchewan, and neither this Court nor the SHRC may inquire into its reasons or interfere with the exercise of its discretion. The Court held that the Court’s decision to exclude the Lawless children from École de Bellegarde was based entirely on the continuing failure of the family to meet their commitments. It also held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue attending the school.","[71] For all of the above reasons, the plaintiffs’ claims for a declaration that the CÉF violated ss. 12(1) and 13(1) of the Code will be stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon an application by the Chief Commissioner of the SHRC pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code.

The court found the parents to be conseil scolaires created by s.42.1 to exercise general supervision and control over French language instruction programs and franaskois schools in Saskatchewan.  5) The Court held that the plaintiffs' claim should be struck as an abuse of process because the plaintiffs never applied for judicial review to set aside the appeal decision rendered by the elected directors of the CéF, and the parties consistently referred to the defendant as the 'CÉF' from this point forward.","[71] For all of the above reasons, the plaintiffs’ claims for a declaration that the CÉF violated ss. 12(1) and 13(1) of the Code will be stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon an application by the Chief Commissioner of the SHRC pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code.

2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","HELD: The Court granted access to the petitioner's daughter from an earlier relationship. The Court found that because he is a'step-parent' to Trista, he does not need to establish that he falls within the category of persons having a'sufficient interest' under the Act.

It certainly would not place him on the same footing as a biological parent or an adoptive parent, vis-à-vis access, as he has suggested.

HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances.

The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant.

Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation applied to set aside its default judgment on the basis of forum non conveniens. The defendant corporation had entered into a letter agreement with the plaintiff to represent its share of the plaintiff's energy savings, the plaintiff taking the position that such savings were entirely unrelated to any advice from the defendant and were, instead, the result of price reductions offered by its own suppliers of fuel. The plaintiff argued that there were triable issues between the parties and that the defendant had failed to establish any reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There was no evidentiary basis sufficient to persuade the court that in order to do justice between these parties, the court should exercise its discretion in favour of the defendant.  2)The defendant conceded that there are triable problems with respect to the jurisdiction of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court. However, he says the defendant was not prejudiced as it had already made it clear to the plaintiff that it was not going to file any defence in Ontario.  3)The court found that the cases relied upon by the defendant to support its principal arguments are not applicable to the circumstances with which am faced. 4)The Court found that any irregularities which may have prompted the issuance of the default judgment are not such as to cause the Court to find that the Order is nullity.","By Interlocutory Notice filed March 2, 1995, the defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment. The first two arguments are procedural, going to the substance of the relief obtained, in that the plaintiff, it is said, did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default order from the Prothonotary and that, therefore, such order should be set aside for irregularity as of right. The defendant says that there are legitimate triable issues between the parties and that there is a reasonable excuse to explain its failure to file a defence. The defendant\'s application to set aside the default judgment is dismissed for the following reasons: Although technically, the plaintiff ought to have sought the court\'s leave to take default under Civil Procedure Rule 12.03 (1), because the statement of claim had combined a request for declaratory relief with a claim for what I consider to be liquidated damages, such a procedural omission did not, in my view, in the circumstances of this case, materially affect the defendant. It is difficult to see how the defendant was possibly prejudiced as it had already made it clear to the plaintiff that it was not going to file a defence in this jurisdiction. However, he says that the defendant has failed to establish any reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. This was not a mistake or an oversight. It was not a failure to file a defence but rather, a deliberate decision not to file a defence. The defendant\'s apparent intention to avoid the jurisdiction of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, while simultaneously drawing the plaintiff into litigation in Ontario where it has no presence, is, in my view, incapable of constituting a reasonable excuse, as contemplated by this court\'s interpretation of Civil Procedure Rule 12.06 in previous cases.

6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","This appeal concerns the application of s. 25 of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. The main issue relates to how the proceeds of sale of property by judicial listing should be applied against mortgage balance when there are both purchase money and non-purchase money balances. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of the Saskatchewan Real Property Security Law and held that the amount of the deficiency judgment should be $162,675. This amount was calculated as follows: $536,186.72 total amount owed to March 23, 2016 ($372,485.01); $87,711.48 balance owed and amount of deficiency judgment III. Hrynewich Holdings accords with the policy behind the legislation as set out earlier in this judgment. The court reviewed the Chambers judge’s decision in Andrew (CA) and found that the proceeds from the judicial sale must be applied to the purchase money portion of the loan. However, the respondent then sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Court found that s.2 of the LCRA protects the debtor from an action on the personal covenant to pay the unpaid balance owing for mortgage taken in part to secure the purchase price of farmland. It also found that any deficiency claim should be limited to the portion of any shortfall to which the original purchase money advanced related to the initial funds advanced. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the respondent was entitled to take out a deficiency judgment of $31,160.23 against the appellants. There were two issues to determine: 1) how should the sale proceeds of the sale be applied on a pro-rated basis to the mortgage balance; and 2) what is the proper amount of this deficiency judgment? Hrynich Holdings was the controlling authority in this case. The defendants were granted a mortgage on a land purchased with part of the $460,800 loan. This loan was consolidation of existing debt. Part of the debt was the balance of $373,089.00 owed on an original loan, which had enabled them to purchase the land. At the time of the Chambers hearing, the balance owed by the defendants fell into default and the defendants commenced foreclosure proceedings. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the defendant. The defendant sought to recover the balance owing on the mortgage.

The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","This appeal concerns the application of s. 25 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. The main issue relates to how the proceeds of sale of property by judicial listing should be applied against mortgage balance when there are both purchase money and non-purchase money balances. HELD: The appeal is allowed with respect to the amount of the deficiency judgment. The respondent is entitled to take out a deficiency judgment of $31,160.23 as at March 2016 against the appellants. 1) The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of the LCRA and held that the amount owed under this mortgage should be $162,675.99. This amount was calculated as follows: $536,186.72 total amount owed to March 2016 ($372,660.00 $186,582.48); the remaining LCRA protection is $1,066.72; the respondent accords with the policy behind the legislation as set out earlier in this judgment. 2) The decision in Hrynewich is correct. The proceeds of the sale be applied to the purchase money portion of the debt. However, the proceeds were not sufficient to satisfy the loan and the respondent then sought an order entitling it to the deficiency.","Appeal allowed [5] There are two issues to determine: a) how should the proceeds of the sale be applied against the mortgage balance, and b) what is the proper amount of the deficiency judgment?

The ground is that Leo Dion, the designated officer of the corporation pursuant to an agreement between the parties, failed to appear at an examination for discovery on November 23, 1993. The defendants have consistently attempted to improperly thwart at every turn the efforts of the plaintiff to determine the matters raised in these lawsuits. HELD: 1)The non-attendance of the Dions did not constitute'refusing or neglecting to attend' within the meaning of Rule 231. It cannot be utilized respecting these particular non- attendances to strike their statements of defence. The complaints of the defendants about the unilateral scheduling by the plaintiff's solicitor is without merit. The date was unilaterally set as a last resort because of the complete lack of courtesy and courtesy and lack of professionalism that is to be expected of a member of the legal profession. 2)The defendants have abused the discretion of the court that was exercised in their favour to set aside the judgments obtained against them and to permit them to file defences.

There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issue of divorce, custody and access was disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The issue of access was not necessary to make further reference to these matters except to say that any access as between the respondent and the child, Randy, shall be mutually agreed upon. HELD: 1)The petitioner was employed and the respondent's income was unlikely to increase in the near future. Given the fact that after the respondent pays child support (including the extra costs) the income of the petitioner and the petitioner will be nearly the same, the Court declined to order any spousal support.  2)The respondent was in loco parentis in respect of Randy. His income varied from year to year. The petitioner spent $100 per week of day care for Breeanna which equals $400 per month. She also pays $40 per month for play school. The total costs of $440.00 per month is to be paid by the petitioner in their respective percentage based on the Guidelines. The respondent is to pay one-half of the cost of extra-curricular activities as is set forth on Exhibits P-9, P-10 and P-ll. Given that the respondent has two children of prior marriage, namely Kaitlyn, born November 1992, and Breeanna, who was born December 11, 1982, the petitioner's income is $11,376 per year and the adjusted income is fixed at $25,721.07. 3)The court found the respondent to have a stronger bargaining power with respect to the tax implications regarding matrimonial property as opposed to the one that would be payable for the two natural children of the respondent. The Court found that the petitioner was to pay $300 per month in child support. 4)The Court found the petitioner to have an interest in the standing crops which were in excess of 10 years old. 5)Costs were to be taken and added to the Guideline amount of support for the three children to obtain the total payable for three children.","[1] This issues for resolution in this trial are:

1. Divorce
2. Custody of the Children
3. Access to the Children
4. Maintenance for the Children
5. Spousal Support
6. Division of Matrimonial Property [17] The petitioner is presently employed and the respondent\'s income is unlikely to increase in the near future. I decline to order any spousal support. However, during the course of the marriage a mortgage debt of $24,000.00 was paid off with matrimonial property therefore the parties agree that $24,000.00 must be added to the value of the matrimonial property as the net increase in the equity in the six quarters. [43] Therefore, the petitioner will have judgment against the respondent for the sum of $113,155.19 less the sum of $15,580.00 (being the value of the assets in her possession) leaving a balance of $97,575.19 to be paid to the petitioner, less one-half the costs of the appraisals.

The issue of access to the children was left to the parties to determine their future income. HELD: 1)The petitioner was employed and the respondent was to pay child support (including the extra costs) of $948.00 per year not including the child support she received for Randy.  2)Spousal support was to be paid by the petitioner in their respective percentage based on the Guidelines. The respondent's income was $11,376 per year and his adjusted income was fixed at $25,721.07. 3)The respondent's net matrimonial property after partnership debts was $509,868. The petitioner's income from her employment in restaurant was $798.00 gross per month. However, she received tips which equate to about $10 per day. Therefore, she earned approximately $150 per month in tips. The total costs of $440.00 for the petitioner and $5,000 for the respondent were to be $101,967.00.
