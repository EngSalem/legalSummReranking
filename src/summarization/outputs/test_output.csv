The applicant sought an order pursuant to ss.87 and 251 of the Land Titles Act, cancelling the existing Certificate of Title in the name of the respondent and directing the registrar to issue a new title in their joint names with a right of survivorship. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The applicant had an alternate remedy. Not a remedy that would correct the mistake but could provide compensation for any loss suffered as a result of the mistake. Damages in the circumstances were not, in my opinion, a reasonably convenient remedy or procedure for giving relief. The title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other.  2)The respondent intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly.

Their lawyer prepared a written agreement for the sellers and purchasers as well as the mortgage describing the purchasers as joint tenants. The sellers, unrepresented by legal counsel, prepared the transfer of the property and title issued without the words 'joint tenants'. The error describing the purchasers went unnoticed by their lawyer. The respondent had been married to the deceased when he died intestate in 1998. As the title stood an undivided one-half interest was owned by the estate and would devolve to the respondent pursuant to the Intestate Succession Act.

Rochon were satisfied. There was an obvious mistake which required rectification.

Jurisdiction to hear such a case flows from the Probate Act and is based on the historic statutory, common law and equity authorities of the Court modelled on the English Probate Court.

While certain issues were resolved in the middle of trial, some of the evidence led in both respects.","A wife claimed part of the estate of her estranged husband.

The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs."

It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs."

The plaintiff applies for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposes the application and requests a summary trial. HELD: The plaintiff is entitled to 7 months notice. 1) The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating there is a genuine need for trial.  2) The plaintiff was able to obtain employment within approximately two and one-half months of the end of the notice period given to him by the employer at wage considerably below what he had earned with the defendant. The evidence establishes the plaintiff applied to numerous autobody businesses prior to accepting the employment he did and was not successful in obtaining an equivalent position at an equivalent salary. 3) In the case of a person in the plaintiff's position, who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice periods should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there was a considerable wage difference between a management position and one that was assigned to two persons. 4) Taking all factors into account, the Court considers this is an appropriate notice period to which the plaintiff was entitled.","FIAT.

The Crown did not have a duty to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a kick caused bodily harm, even though it was the truck that actually killed the victim. 6) The accused did cause bodily harm when he grabbed the arm of the complainant and pulled him from the vehicle.

HELD: 1)The accused was an 18 year old single mother of one child and three months pregnant with a second child at the time of the crime. She had no criminal record but was at large on bail awaiting trial on other charges. The accused was a known drug dealer and lived in the basement suite where she and another man had a common intention to rob the occupants of the house of either drugs or cash or both. The sentence imposed by the trial judge did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that the sentence be proportionate and proportionate. Nor did the sentence achieve the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. [2]The accused had no previous criminal record. She did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victims and intervened to stop the beating of the robbers, albeit only after she seemed satisfied that he had nothing to give the robbers; and (c) she seems to be doing well in all programs in prison. [3]The Crown appealed the sentence, arguing the sentence was too harsh and that the accused was guilty of a common criminal enterprise planned in advance and expected to be violent.","The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence of 2.5 years for manslaughter on the grounds it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of deterrence and denunciation. HELD: A sentence of 5 years of imprisonment was imposed. The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent. The accused pled guilty, had no criminal record, did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victim who died from the wounds or of the other victim; she intervened to stop the beating although only after being satisfied the alleged the drug dealer had nothing to give the robbers.  The accused appeared to be doing well in the prison programs. The sentence of the co-accused who had a record of 40 previous convictions had been increased to the equivalent of more than 10 years imprisonment."
36,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"The applicant sought injunctive relief pursuant to s. 65 of the Queen's Bench Act and Queen’s Bench Rule No. 387(a) prohibiting and restraining the Respondents from producing and marketing potassium sulphate. The applicant had previously been the President and Director of the plaintiff, Big Quill Resources Inc., and had been in receivership for more than one year. The plaintiff had purchased the plant from the defendant in 1997. The defendant had not received the technology described in the Technology Licensing Agreement attached to the Affidavit of Harvey Haugen. The defendants had entered into an exclusive marketing agreement with Big Quills to use the ion exchange technology developed by Big Quils. The agreement did not include any contractual or other relationship between the defendant and the plaintiff. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The plaintiff had not been able to establish a prima facie case that the technology licensed to it was the technology used by the defendant. 2)Big Quill was attempting to assert that it somehow had a proprietary interest in the scientific principles known as ion exchange and crystallization. 3)The defendant had no written client lists or other written information that belonged to the defendant or the plaintiff; the defendant developed its own system from scratch with the assistance of third parties and was not modelled on or copied from the Defendant. 4)The applicant had not obtained sufficient assurances that the defendant's system was efficient enough for its needs. 5)Although the defendant had obtained a patent for a process similar to the one used in the patent agreement, the defendant did not have a formal or contractual relationship with the plaintiff or its receiver/manager. 6)The defendants had not paid any funds whatsoever to the plaintiff under the terms of the Technology License Agreement and/or the Exclusive Marketing Agreement and, as a result, the within action was commenced in February 1998.","The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction pursuant to s.65 of the Queen's Bench Act and Queen's Bench Rule 387(a) prohibiting and restraining the respondents from producing and manufacturing potassium sulphate near Alsask until further order; an order restraining the respondent from selling, marketing, or disposing of the potassium sulphate for profit until further order; other ancillary relief; costs of the application. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents in any event of the cause. The applicant did not demonstrate an entitlement to injunctive relief on the second and third stages of the three stage test. The applicant demonstrated there was a serious question to be tried but failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm. The delay (the action was commenced February 16, 1998) was considered. On balance the respondents would suffer greater harm if the injunction were granted as the respondent Nylen makes his living marketing and selling potassium sulphate."

38,Conclusion | Issue | Issue | Reason | Reason Document : ,"HELD: 1) The applicant sought injunctive relief against the respondent such as would prohibit the respondent from producing any potassium sulphate and would further enjoin both defendants from selling, marketing or otherwise disposing of any potassium. The factual foundation upon which the applicant relies is set forth in detail in the affidavit of Harvey Haugen, businessman resident at Wynyard, Saskatchewan, who deposes as a professional engineer with many years of ion exchange experience. The plaintiff entered into the Technology Licensing Agreement with the view to considering Big Quill's technology as a possible option for its Alsask plant. 2) The plaintiff had no written client lists or other written information that could even remotely be considered technology. 3) The defendant did not receive from the plaintiff the technology described in the Technology licensing agreement. 4) The court found that the plaintiff had not obtained sufficient assurances that the technology licensed to it was efficient enough for its purposes. The court ordered an interlocutory injunction restraining and prohibiting the defendant from producing or marketing any potassium sulfate produced at its plant. 5) Although the defendant had developed its own system from scratch with the assistance of third parties, it did so via a system that was not modelled on or copied from the defendant. 6) The Court found that there was urgency in obtaining requested interlocututory injunctions as a result of Prairie Sulphate's acquisition of the plaintiff's assets.","The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction pursuant to s.65 of the Queen's Bench Act and Queen's Bench Rule 387(a) prohibiting and restraining the respondents from producing and manufacturing potassium sulphate near Alsask until further order; an order restraining the respondent from selling, marketing, or disposing of the potassium sulphate for profit until further order; other ancillary relief; costs of the application.

The plaintiff's affidavit does not set out acts upon which in the words of Ives v.

The respondent had also received a number of 'other statements' by individuals claiming to have been victims of institutional abuse from the respondent. 4)In this case the respondent was granted access to the record. 5)The appellant was granted the opportunity to review and modify the compensation process.  6)The extent to which the various roles of the R.C.M.P., Department of justice and the ADR Program became meshed and interchangeable was clearly set forth in paras. 11-33 of the affidavit of Inspector Atkins. The appeal is taken from a decision of the Justice Minister in October 1998.","The applicant was aware that allegations of abuse had been made against him in an alternative dispute resolution process undertaken by the Province with respect to his former employment. He applied under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for certain information concerning these allegations. The FOIPOP Privacy Coordinator denied access and the applicant appealed. Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven. The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo.

It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks.

Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made Ms. Clayton aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period from September 2001 to November 2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The Credit Union argued that the applicant's claim was based on his being one of the named purchasers in the original agreement and being the registered owner of the vehicle. All other indicia of ownership were in her favour. HELD: The claim was enforceable as against the conflicting claim. 1)The owner of a motor vehicle in Saskatchewan is the person who is named in the current registration certificate pertaining to that vehicle. Lenders, police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. The applicant has also argued that at time when the registration of a Credit Union had lapsed, she transferred ownership from her husband's name to her name. Such a transfer would only serve the purpose of defeating the credit union's claim if it were undertaken for value and without notice, which was not the case here. 2)The claim of the credit Union is enforceable. It is not the only reason for registration of vehicles in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance (SGI).","The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry.

80,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"This was an application for the interpretation of the Last Will and Testament of the testator and specifically to determine the entitlement of the Estate of Jane Mitchell under the Will pursuant to s. 31 of the Wills Act. HELD: 1) The Will was prepared on a pre-printed stationer's form with handwritten portions indicating the disposition of J.D.'s assets. It was intended to make the gift personae designatae rather than a class gift. 2) There was no reference in the Will to the number of the brothers and reading the whole of the Will would suggest the residue was to go to 'class'. 3) The provision of Section 31 which prevents lapse in the case of gift to the child or other issue of testator makes it unnecessary to consider whether the intention is not clear from the Will and adopts the 'rules of construction' the principle is that a court must ascertain the ordinary meaning of the words used in light of the surrounding circumstances. The distinction is founded on the law of lapse. In the former case there is a gift to individual children by name and there is lapse as to children dying in the testsator's lifetime. 4) The proper procedure is to form an opinion, apart from the cases and then determine whether the cases require modification of that opinion; the Court should not begin by considering how far the will resembles others on which decisions have been given: Re Blantern, Lowe v. Cooke, [1891] W.N. 54. 5) The distinction between class gift and any other gift is an important one in cases of lapse, and the Court found for or against the characterization of gift as class gift depending on the effect such finding will have. In Kingsbury v. Walter, [1901] A.C. 187, Feeney says: “The general rule concerning disposition of lapsed gifts does not operate in a case of property given to a group of persons (a class), unless the gifts is separate one to each individual, which forms the context to the clause. The gift is not to form part of matrimonial assets. In Snyder, where the will not only named the members of the class but also mentioned their number, the gift was held to be class gift, at least for the purpose of avoiding lapse.","The testator had prepared his own Will on a pre-printed form and left his assets to his children, whom he then proceeded to name. One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will. the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it. The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention. Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception. In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given. The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will."

The defendants counterclaim for the sum of $56,000 for additional rent and unpaid business taxes for 1992. HELD: 1) The delay in this case is full nine years after the cause of action arose. There is no evidence that the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the parties had long since been settled so they had no possible reason to give any notice to the plaintiff respecting time limitations. The plaintiff acted neither promptly nor reasonably by'sitting on her rights' for some 9 years. 2) The plaintiff's diligence is consistent with s. (2)'s focus on what is equitable. It will generally be less equitable for limitation defence to defeat the claim of diligent plaintiff than one who has sat back on his or her rights.","The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants for breach of contract in regard to the defendants' refusal to return to her the substantial security deposit that she paid as part of a motel lease.

The parties had lived separate and apart for more than a year immediately preceding the determination of the divorce proceeding. The issues were: 1) Spousal support; 2) Ms. Bemister's allegation that the husband failed to provide her with an automobile; the grounds for divorce as alleged. The Divorce Judgment was granted on the grounds that there had been a breakdown of the marriage and that the parties had not established any disadvantages arising from the marriage. However, there were disadvantages related to its breakdown. The court ordered that the support and maintenance may be reviewed between them personally or through their respective Solicitors to settle what, if any, financial consequences arising from its care over and above any obligation for the support of any child.","The parties were married for 10 years. Contrary to the wording of their separation agreement, the husband argued that they had agreed that spousal support would only be payable for one year as the wife needed extra income from a secure source in order to obtain a mortgage on a new home. Also at issue was the husband's obligation to provide the wife with an automobile pursuant to the separation agreement. Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile.

124,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"The respondent was sentenced to 6 months deferred custody and supervision followed by 6 months of probation for a variety of matters including break and enters, theft, weapons offence and drug offence. He breached the terms of his deferred custody order in June 2004 and was directed to serve the remainder of his sentence under custody and community supervision. He was not found by police until almost a month later. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The court accepted the Crown's argument and found that the Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA). 2) Section 107 of the YCJA creates a right of appeal in respect of review under ss.102(1)(b) and the contrast in this regard with the power of the director under s.106 to suspend conditional supervision is misplaced and lead to an analysis which focused on the wrong question. The real question before the Court is whether the sentence was deemed not to be continuing following the issuance of the warrant. It is not whether the provincial director had the power to suspend the community supervision because the sentence had already expired. 3) Section 102(2)(b)(c) is a statutory interpretation of s.107. It allows a young person to avoid the supervision aspect of a sentence directly undercuts the objectives of rehabilitation and reintegration. 4) Section 103(2) does not include the word 'apprehension' because that is all it refers to. 5) Section 106(2(b) is the opening marginal note to s. 107. Section 107 is included in s102(2). Section 107(1) incorporates the procedure applicable to s106. The provincial director may suspend the conditional supervision and order that the young person be remanded to custody until review is conducted. 6) Section 109(4) to (8) applies, with any modifications that the circumstances require, to a sentence imposed after due process and careful consideration by the sentencing judge.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself."

Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact."

164,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and sentenced to indeterminate detention. He had a lengthy criminal record for violence towards his wife and others, but over time he became less violent towards others. He also had a serious alcohol problem. The types of offences committed by the accused were explosive incidents of violence in the context of drunken arguments. The Court of Appeal remitted this matter back to the trial court as it was of the view that there had not been adequate consideration of the opportunities that might exist for the eventual control of the offender's risk to re-offend in the future. HELD: The accused was found to be a dangerous offender despite the fact that the statutory criteria in Part XXIV of the Criminal Code had been interpreted recently by both the Supreme Court of Canada and the Appeal Court of Saskatchewan. The statutory requirements for finding that an offender is dangerous offender are found in s. 753(1) of the Code. The accused would have been on probation at the time all of these offences were committed, having been released from custody on Sept. 21, 1992. The court reviewed R. v. R.H.L. and found that the accused was a long-term offender, even if he met the criteria of dangerous offender. The sentencing judge must consider whether the sentencing sanctions available pursuant to the long term offender provisions are sufficient to reduce this threat to an acceptable level.","The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence."

There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence."

The Defence position was that he should be designated a long-term offender. HELD: The Court found that the accused was a danger to the public because of his pattern of repetitive behaviour, which showed a reasonable possibility of causing death or injury to other persons, and a substantial degree of indifference on the part of the offender respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences of his behaviour. The Court reviewed the applicable law at the outset, given that there were significant amendments to Part XXIV of the Code in 1997 which made it clear that in order to achieve the goal of protection of the public under the dangerous offender and long term offender provisions, there must be evidence of treatability that is more than an expression of hope and that indicates that the specific offender can be treated within a definite period of time. This is especially true where the offender does not suffer from an inherent defect of character or reason.","The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender.

The child had been in the mother's care for four years and her father had advised her that she should move with him to Alberta. The father advised the Court that he would move with the child to Alberta in order for her to have access to the mother. The mother advised the court that she would like to have the child returned to her own care and custody.

He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship.

HELD: The application is adjourned sine die.  1) It is the position of the plaintiffs that they require particulars of reviews and inquiries in order to determine the level of skill of the defendant in performing laparoscopic gynecological surgery. His performances both before and after the surgery performed on the plaintiff, Lisa Dawson, are relevant to that issue. The plaintiffs maintain that they are not seeking documents relating to the inquiries or reviews, only factual information.  2) There has not been a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the defendant. The questions raised by the plaintiffs relate to the issues in this action, but only to the extent that they relate to breach of duty or standard of care in performing the laparoscopy. The test for striking paragraphs pursuant to Rule 173(c) on the basis they are scandalous, frivolous or vexatious is different. 3) There is no authority for permitting that line of inquiry, either as similar fact evidence or as an exception to privilege. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to responses in relation to, but limited to, the following: (a) the approximate number of occasions that the plaintiff underwent a tubal ligation on patients prior to that performed on her; (b) whether bowel puncture occurred during those procedures and if so, on how many occasions; (c) whether punctured bowel during that procedure prompted a quality assurance review by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the province where the procedure was conducted or by any other body; and (d) whether the plaintiff has taken any retraining or upgrading since obtaining her Level B certification.  5) The Court is limited to looking at the claim and particulars provided, if any, when deciding whether to strike paragraphs.  6) It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage of the proceedings to conclude that the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any probative value.  7) The court is satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination of the applicants.","FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons.

Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff."

At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff."

The accused was found to be in the passenger seat of an idling vehicle. He was found by the investigating officer behind the wheel of the vehicle in the driver's seat. He did not intend to drive the vehicle. There were other considerations that added to the public risk or increased the likelihood of the accused changing his mind.,"The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public."

180,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"The complainant was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. She was the common law spouse of the accused and had been with him for seven years. She had a fresh injury on her neck and chest, there was fresh blood on the floor and she stated that the accused had punched her. She said that she had no recollection of the night in question because she was very intoxicated and the whole night is “blur”. She did not remember going to her neighbour’s or having any injury. Her memory was not assisted by hearing the tape of the 911 call, although she did recognize the voice of the complainant. HELD: The Court found that the test for admissibility of hearsay statements was met when the complainant recanted on an earlier statement. The Court pointed to the fact that the complainant was jealous and possessive behaviour as a further indicator of reliability.  1) The Court noted that the Court was not only instructive as to the type of evidence that might be considered supportive of trustworthiness but also in situations where statements are recorded on video and taken under oath that there might be sufficient indicia of reliability to justify an application to have the statements admitted into evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule. 2) It was clear that the evidence was important to the Crown's case and there was no other means of obtaining that evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way, she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. 3) The test of necessity has been met. The facts are relatively straight-forward. The complainant, [A.G.] is the common- law spouse. She lived in an apartment building next door to [D.P.'s daughter. In September 2006, she arrived unexpectedly at her neighbour's residence. She asked that the police be called. The police arrived within 5 minutes of the call to 911. When the complainant came to the apartment, she was upset, scared and crying. She repeated a consistent version of what she had been told to the police. She stated that she and the accused were in an argument over a bank card. During the course of this dispute, he put his hands on the neck in an attempt to strangle her. Further these statements were made contemporaneously and spontaneously to a friend without any apparent guile.","The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application.

Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made."

The issue before the court was whether the father should pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children, given his current educational difficulties. HELD: 1)The mother sought retroactive child support. Although the father had been voluntarily providing child support to his mother, at least since February 2007, the mother was required to bring this motion to obtain an appropriate sharing of s. expenses. The mother has not filed enough evidence regarding the child's circumstances. The father does not have the ability to pay retroactive support.  2)The father was unable to make a spousal support order because the father did not have necessary resources to pay monthly sum to the Mother once he had satisfied his child support obligations.","FIAT: The primary issue is whether the father should pay for tutoring expenses. HELD: 1) The father is not opposed to Kody receiving some additional educational assistance. However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400."

On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month.

190,Conclusion | Issue | Issue | Reason | Reason Document : ,"HELD: The matter was before the Court for a number of orders regarding child support and an order regarding summer access. The mother's evidence disclosed that both children were in need of a specialized educational program given their current problems at school. The father had been voluntarily providing child support to the mother, at least since February, 2007, the mother was required to bring this motion to obtain an appropriate sharing of s. expenses. Although it is clear from the evidence that the mother has an entitlement to interim spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. Retroactive child support was ordered pursuant to s. 15.3(1) of the Divorce Act to give priority to child support in determining child support applications.","FIAT: The primary issue is whether the father should pay for tutoring expenses.

The issue before the court was whether the father should pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children.

The father did not have the ability to pay. 4) The court was unable to make a spousal support order because the father does not have necessary resources to pay the mother once he has satisfied his child support obligations.","FIAT: The primary issue is whether the father should pay for tutoring expenses.

This is not to say the propounder need prove negative that the testatory was not induced by undue influence to sign the will but the court must scrutinize the evidence closely in light of the suspicion to determine whether undue influence ought to be drawn. 2) All the Queen's Bench Rules shall apply to the trial of the foregoing issues including the Rules pertaining to disclosure, production of documents, examinations for discovery and pretrial conference.","The applicant asks that the Will be proven in solemn form to determine whether there was undue influence on the testator. HELD: The evidence from the lawyer who prepared the Testator's last Will was that she was concerned that the testator was being influenced. The evidence from the executor of the Estate raises no such concerns. Based on the evidence, the conflict in the evidence and the law, the issue of undue influence cannot be resolved without a trial of the issue. A trial is ordered."

There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place."

HELD: The order was granted with the proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The children had been in care for most of their lives. The father had been on the methadone program for six months. The mother was not seeking a return of the children to her directly but supported the position of the father who asked that the children be returned to him in his care. The child had a substantial criminal record which included 16 offences as youth. His youth offences were primarily property crimes, drugs offences but primarily related to failing to comply with recognizances and probation orders. His last conviction was in January 2006 for using cocaine. The parents had weekly two hour supervised visits with the father. The screens were an indicator of how well the children generally appeared to be happy when they were with the parents. There were additional conditions that they would both find suitable housing and work cooperatively with the Ministry. The witness from the Ministry became involved with the matter in April 2005. She was not able to confirm that H.H. had attended any programming. The purpose of this PSA was that the parents would not expose their children, in this case both N.S. and D.S., to drug use or domestic violence so the children would continue to live in a safe environment and have appropriate care. This PSA is found at Tab B-27. H. was the worker on this matter since July 2007. During that time, both children have been in the care of foster parents and the natural parents had been visiting the children at the clinic. The natural parents have been supporting the father's efforts to rehabilitate the children and provide them with appropriate support. The PSA also included conditions that the father would attend Narcotics Anonymous once a week for the next six months and that the mother would submit drug screens and take anger management classes.","The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old.

The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH.

There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time.

224,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"The plaintiff brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order compelling the defendant to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant (relating to a test of their premises for contamination). The plaintiff sought to have the defendant compel it to serve pre-certification notices to all persons who had travelled with the defendant during the purposed class. The defendant moved to dismiss the claim against it on the basis that there was no plaintiff named in the statement of claim who purchased the Holguin vacation package from the defendant. The plaintiff opposed the motion. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1) The court found that the wording of s. 14 and s. 24 of the Act precludes the application for examination of witnesses prior to certification of the action. 2) The Court found that neither the section dealing with the service of notice (section 19 of the Ontario Class Proceedings Act) nor the general provision allowing the Court to make any order considers appropriate (section 12) are limited to actions that have already been certified.  3) It was not in the Court's view that either section can only be referenced by a party after the action has been approved as a class action. 4) It is important to keep in mind that there have not been any previous cases in which a plaintiff was allowed to cross examine a defendant on an affidavit. However, this is still an 'action' and not a 'class action' only. The usual practices and application of the common law regarding civil litigation apply. The Court's inherent jurisdiction to control its own process has been defined as the exercise of it residual power to ensure due process of lase, to present improper vexation or oppression, to secure fair trial between the parties and to secure a fair trial. 5) The plaintiff did not seek through this motion to restrain the defendant from distributing the package nor did it seek to compel the court to direct Inco to change any portion of the material. The court merely wanted to give an opportunity to the plaintiff to put forth evidence regarding the alleged settlement and to give the plaintiffs a chance to reply. 6) In light of the above contextual understanding of the law and how it came to be; it is not necessary in my view to discuss the complexities of pre certification. It would appear that the court was concentrating more on common law.","Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated.

This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue.

There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit.

There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements.

228,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal referred the matter of determination of the calculation of the IRB for the respondent as non-earner as determined by the Automobile Accident Insurance Act and Regulations. HELD: The respondent was awarded an amount less than that of the respondent. 1) The IRB is calculated on a formula of gross yearly employment income (GEOI) less deductions under the provincial and federal income tax acts, premiums under the Unemployment Insurance Act (Canada), and contributions to the Canada Pension Plan. 2) SGI was correctly calculating the respondent's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. 3) The hearing judge raised no concern with respect to the 'weighted average approach' employed by SGI beyond advancing an interpretation of s. 117(4) of the Act that, on it face, is inconsistent with the weighting average approach used by the SGI. As the respondent has not been successful in this proceeding, he is not entitled to any more costs.","At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners.

229,Issue | Issue | Reason | Reason | Conclusion Document : ,"The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal referred the matter of determination of the calculation of the IRB for the non-earner as defined by the Automobile Accident Insurance Act and s. 24 Personal Injury Benefits Regulations. The parties brought the matter back for further determination because SGI is paying an amount less than that of Montgrand. HELD: 1) The IRB is calculated on a formula of gross yearly employment income (GEOI) less deductions under the provincial and federal income tax acts, premiums under the Unemployment Insurance Act (Canada), and contributions to the Canada Pension Plan. It strives for one's earning reality. The phrase'subject to' may mean'subservient to' or'subordinate to' but that is too restrictive a definition of the phrase. Section 198 of the Act and Regulation 101 contemplate the payment of claimant's solicitor and client costs if the claimant is successful on appeal. Because Montgrand has not been successful in this proceeding, he is not entitled to any more costs from SGI.  2) SGI was correctly calculating Montgrand's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find his net income and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. The provisions of s. 135 138 of the act apply. 3) It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. Therefore, the 180 day income replacement benefit against which s. 117(4) is designed to be measured is that of a 'weighted average' calculation."" 4) The hearing judge raised no concern with respect to the 'weighting average approach' used by SGI in calculating the income replacement benefits for the post 180 day period. Counsel now concedes that SGI's calculation of interest on monies owed to Montgrand on the basis of pre-judgment interest is inconsistent with the purpose of the legislation.","At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners.

230,Conclusion | Issue | Issue | Reason | Reason Document : ,"HELD: 1) The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal referred the matter of determination of the calculation of the IRB for the non-earner as defined by the Automobile Accident Insurance Act and Regulations. The hearing judge held that the income replacement benefit payable during the post 180 day period was not to be less than the amount received pursuant to s. 116 of the Act. The IRB is calculated on a formula of gross yearly employment income (GEOI) less deductions under the provincial and federal income tax acts, premiums under the Unemployment Insurance Act (Canada), and contributions to the Canada Pension Plan. The final IRB was equal to 90% of the victim's net income. 2) SGI was correct in applying Regulation 102 which states that interest payable pursuant to Part VIII is to be calculated in accordance with the pre-judgment interest Act. 3) The phrase'subject to the other provisions of this Division' as meaning 'governed by' or 'affected by' s. 117(1) is a too restrictive definition of the phrase. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. The disability benefits pursuant to SGI should not be taken into consideration to reduce Montgrand’s IRB. 4) The provision of s 117, in effect at the relevant time, states: If, as a result of an accident, a victim is entitled to an income replacement and disability benefit pursuant to the Saskatchewan Government Insurance Act or any similar program in a jurisdiction outside Saskatchewan, the insurer shall reduce the income substitute benefit by the amount of the disability benefit payable to the victim. 5) The Court concluded that SGI had correctly calculated Montgrand's income in the first 180 days when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find his net income and then reduced the net income to 90%.","At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI.

The accused was detained for 11 minutes until a breath sample was obtained. The officer placed the accused in the police vehicle because he was investigating a possible drunk driving charge but also because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. A voir dire was held during the course of the trial. HELD: The accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights were not infringed.  1) The officer's failure to make the ASD demand was not made forthwith. The delay of 11 minutes can be attributed largely to waiting for the breath sample to arrive. Officers who fail to equip their vehicles with an ASD risk the unlawful detention of individuals and the potential exclusion of evidence at trial. The Certificate of Analyses which established that the accused's blood alcohol level exceeded the legal limits were admissible notwithstanding the ground for making the breath demand was an illegally obtained fail result on an ASD (see R. v. Ritchie, [2011] SKPC 59). 2) The defence argued the accused, while eventually given the opportunity to speak to Legal Aid, was not given an opportunity to make a demand under s. 254(3). The accused submits his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure, and the Certificate of Analysis is admitted into evidence.  3) The Court found the delay was not unreasonable and the evidence sought to be excluded was highly reliable and could not form part of the reasonable and probable grounds for making a demand. 4) The court found the accused was arbitrarily detained for an 11 minute period until the demand was made at 3:10 a.m. and the officer did not provide the accused with his after-hours contact numbers or obtain their home numbers. 5) Section 254(2) requires an analysis of three factors: (1) the seriousness of Charter infringing state conduct; (2) the impact of the breach on the Charter protected interests of the accused; and (3) society's interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits.","The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident. The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised.

The accused was detained for 11 minutes until the demand was made at 3:10 a.m. The officer informed the accused that he had been in an accident and that a sample of his breath had been obtained. The police officer placed the accused in the police vehicle because he was investigating a possible drunk driving charge but also because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. He called Legal Aid duty counsel, who advised him he should call Legal Aid, but the officer indicated that he did not have a lawyer and advised him that Legal Aid was not available. HELD: The accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights were not infringed. The Certificate of Analyses which established that the accused's blood alcohol level exceeded the legal limits were admissible notwithstanding the ground for making the breath demand was an illegally obtained fail result on an ASD (see R. v. Ritchie). The Court found the delay was not unreasonable, where the time between the demand to provide a breath sample into an ASD and the taking of the sample was 11 minutes because the machine was unavailable. The Court also found that the delay of 11 minutes can be attributed largely to waiting for the ASD to arrive. Officers who fail to equip their vehicles with an ASD risk the unlawful detention of individuals and the potential exclusion of evidence at trial.  1) Section 254(2) gives authority to a police officer to demand breath samples for analysis at the roadside, if certain conditions are met. This is the basis upon which the courts have held that Parliament may infringe on a suspect's right to counsel. 2) The officer's failure to make the demand 11 minutes earlier than he did can form the reasonable grounds for a breathalyzer demand under s. 254(3). 3) There is nothing to indicate he could not have made the ASD demand at that point, even though the device itself was not yet present.  4) The court found the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his Charter rights.  5) The Court held that the Court's view that the Charter breaches were moderately serious and the officer's reasonable diligence in attempting to contact counsel was not violated.","The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident.

The accused was arbitrarily detained for 11 minutes and a sample of his breath was obtained. The Court held the accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights were not infringed. The Certificate of Analyses was admitted into evidence.","The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident. The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged.

The accused was detained for 11 minutes and a breathalyzer demand was made. At the police station, the accused was arbitrarily detained for that period of time and a sample of his breath was obtained. However, the officer appeared to have acted in good faith.

HELD: The accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights were not infringed.  1) The Court found that the accused's right to counsel was not breached. 2) There was a range in the potential impact upon an accused, from 'fleeting and technical to profoundly invasive'. The more serious the effect of the breach on an accused's Charter rights, the greater the risk that the admission of the evidence obtained as a result of it would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 3) The officer's failure to make the ASD demand was not made forthwith. 4) The delay was of a relatively short duration compared to the 33 minutes in Hatzel.  5) There is no rule with respect to the exact number of minutes which must elapse before the demand falls outside the 'forthwith' requirement—each case is dependent upon its circumstances.  6) Section 254(2) gives authority to a police officer to demand a breath sample for analysis at the roadside, if certain conditions are met. If the officer's reasonable diligence in attempting to contact counsel gives rise to the breaches the accused being arbitrarily detained, he is not afforded his right to consult counsel.","The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident.

The sentencing judge erred in law in his interpretation of s. 490.013(2.1). The meaning of the section is plain: offenders who commit multiple designated offences will be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order. Nothing in the Code suggests the lifetime duration of the order rests on the offender being sentenced separately for each offence.,"The accused was convicted of four counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code.

The trial judge held that the principle of qualified privilege protected the union and its representatives when the latter republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. He fixed a provisional award of $25,000 for the defamatory statements.  1)The trial judge correctly referred to Grant v. Torstar Corp., 2009 SCC 61 (Toronto: Carswell, 1999) as a legal conclusion that the law is circumspect in granting absolute privilege and the scope of the privilege is narrowly interpreted, owing to the potential for abuse of such privilege. 2)The court found that the trial judge erred by finding that the words in the Grievance Report were not defamatories and, in any event, the words were protected by absolute privilege. 3)There was no evidence of malice. The court was satisfied that the plaintiff had not been defamed by the publication of the grievance. It would not have been unreasonable for the plaintiff to conclude that the statements contained in the grievance were entirely unfounded and without substance.","The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed."

He was bound by a youth probation order based on a conviction of possession for the use of cocaine. One of the terms of that probation order was that he was to stay out of the Province unless he had permission of the Court. The accused was sentenced to six months deferred custody and supervision. The Court found that with this not being a violent offence and with his limited criminal record, the accused was not subject to custody under either s. 39(1)(d) or (c). The Court also placed the accused on a six month deferred custody order.","The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender."

312,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"FIAT: The plaintiff asks the court to order the defendants to answer certain questions it refused to answer on discovery. The plaintiff argues that the defendants' application in respect of certain undertakings is premature and unnecessary since it had undertaken to provide answers in the future upon the conclusion of its questioning of the plaintiff or upon additional particulars becoming available to it. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) There is no implied waiver of the litigation privilege that otherwise attaches to the foundational information leading to the preparation of a claim. The questions raised raise issues relating to the proper scope of production and questioning under the Queen's Bench Rules and the implied waiver should be narrowly construed and the privilege should be maintained where it is fair to do so. 2) Given the answers provided at the time of questioning, the court is of the opinion that for proportionality reasons the plaintiff should not be required to answer the question.  3) The plaintiff is obliged to indicate its present positions and facts now known or believed to exist. The request can be made but it is entirely up to the plaintiff to decide whether or not to accommodate CN. There was nothing in Clarke's refusal to answer that was inappropriate. 4) Where materiality or whether matter is in issue and relevance fall into ranges where the matter is debatable, the decision whether question or production demand is proper may need to address the proportionality considerations that flow from the principles outlined in the foundational rules. 5) The Court is satisfied that when an expert takes the witness stand or the expert's report is tendered into evidence there is an implied waiver that is foundational to the opinion. This topic is not an issue in the action, either as matter expressly pled or by virtue of being an essential element of the cause of action alleged.","HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied.

The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with.

316,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"FIAT. The parties were married in 2008 and separated in April 2011. The mother had to obtain an ex parte order returning the children to her care. The father had been in custody since September 2012, first on remand, then as serving prisoner. He was sentenced in October 2012 and was eligible for early release in December 2013. HELD: The Court found that the mother's decision to move with the children on an interim basis was not an exceptional case, as the father had not considered the best interests of the children and did not presently have a viable parenting alternative. The Court ordered that the children have access with their father while he is incarcerated. 1) The mother's unilateral move was unfortunate. While she claimed that she reversed this move and went back to Nokomis, the father harbours suspicions that she and the children actually remained in Kenaston. This situation has not gone to trial and is far from concluded. Her willingness (or lack of same) to ensure a connection between the children with him may well be a significant factor in her remaining the primary parent. 2) The Court reviewed the Gordon v. Goertz principles and found that although personal access to an incarcerated parent may be beneficial to children in some instances, it is only considered on an exceptional basis and then where the reason is relevant to the parent's ability to meet the children's needs. This is such a case. Here, not only has the mother formed a new relationship with a man from Kenaston, she is pregnant. Her ability to act as parent to her two existing children will necessarily be impacted by the arrival of a third. This defies common sense. 3) There is little utility in reviewing the events within the marriage in exhaustive detail. Suffice it to say that from the outset, the marriage was tempestuous. Within months of the marriage the father was charged criminally and served time in jail. When this action was commenced in spring 2011, she was pregnant. She cannot reasonably be expected not to feel the impact of the move being prevented if her new life partner is not living with her, and providing support (financial, physical, emotional) for the new child. This will transfer over to the two older children. The move is not for a job, nor for any other sort of economic opportunity. But are such economic benefits considered to outweigh the considerations of the formation of a new family? 4) There was no evidence the children wished to move while he was incarcerated.","The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant. She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse. The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year. The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail. The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children.

320,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"This was an appeal from a Small Claims Court judgment dated August 20, 2012. The grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in failing to weigh necessity and qualification before determining the admissibility of certain opinion evidence tendered on behalf of the plaintiff. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. 1) The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error regarding the calculation of damages.  2) There was no palpable or overriding error in the judge's assessment of the record, nor with her conclusion that the amount of work done was not necessary to repair the damage done when the foundation caved in and water entered the basement.  3) There is a strong presumption of impartiality on the part of a trial judge. In the case of Wewaykum Indian Band v. Canada, 2003 SCC 45 (CanLII), [2003] S.C.R. 259, the burden is on the party arguing for disqualification to establish that the circumstances justify a finding that the judge must be disqualified. 4) While there was uncertainty about the timing of the broken concrete grade beam, Mr. Aubin testified that rotten triple-ply beam had been problem for over ten years.  5) The standard of review in respect to appeals brought pursuant to s. 39 of the Act was dealt with in Kitzul v. Ungar (1991), 1991 CanLII 7678 (SK QB), [1991] SCC 577 (Q.B.). 6) It is not the role of an appellate court to second guess the weight to be assigned to the various items of evidence. If there is an apprehension of bias, it is only where the inference-drawing process itself is palpably in error that a court can interfere with the factual conclusion.","The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair.

The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair.

There was no evidence to support the Chambers judge's conclusion that Mr. Lawson's payment of expenses pertaining to that family home ceased after October 2015 was not supported by the evidence before him. 3) There was an arguable issue regarding the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim support and the quantum of that support given the circumstances of the parties, including their incomes, expenses, financial obligations (payment of family debt) and the fact they share custody of their son. 4) If the order is enforced, the appellant may be prejudiciced.","HELD: The application was allowed and the stay of the enforcement of retroactive spousal support was granted.

There was a misunderstanding between the parties. The defendant, having accepted the performance of the plaintiff on the marketing study and paid the consideration therefor, there was no basis for rescission of the agreement pertaining thereto. The plaintiff counterclaimed for judgment for $56,500 and damages. HELD: Fossil's claim for judgment was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant was hired as a fund development officer and the plaintiff was not required to testify on the basis that rescission was not necessary. 2)There was no ambiguity as to the nature of the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. 3)The plaintiff had accepted the plaintiff's offer of a monthly retainer of $6,250 for the month of September. 4)A mutual mistake existed. The contract to that effect binding on Fossil. The time had come for the plaintiff to deliver the funds needed by the plaintiff. It was not reasonable that the market study could accomplish much of what the plaintiff says he was to do as fund developer. It is not unreasonable that the period of six months would not continue beyond June 2 if his new duties were to be more or less the same. The claim for the balance, $25,000, was not well founded.

Fossil thought Fossil was to bring in investment capital and Lovell thought his obligation did not extend to that. The letter of September 18 effectively did that. There was no ambiguity. Lovell was hired as a fund development officer. The question is what was intended by that designation. In Staidman Steel Ltd. v. Commercial Home Builders Ltd., (1977), 71 D.L.R. (3d) 17, Southey, J., at pages 21 and 22, referred to the following statement of Blackburn, J. in Smith v. Hughes, L.Q.B. at page 607: ""If, whatever man's real intention may be, he so conducts himself that reasonable man would believe that he was assenting to the terms proposed by the other party, and that other party upon that belief enters into the contract with him, the man thus conducting himself would be equally bound as if he had intended to agree to the other's terms."" 2)The claim for judgment for $56,500 was rejected on the same ground that rescission was disallowed. 3)The contract was not ambiguous. The designation 'fund development officer' and the phrase 'drilling fund program' is indicative of that binding on Fossil. The market study program was terminated prematurely.

376,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"This was an appeal pursuant to s19 of the Health Services Tax Act in respect of a decision of the Provincial Tax Commission to cancel a claim for a refund of health services tax paid on certain refrigeration equipment which was installed in a new facility for pickled whole herring for sale to the Soviet Union. This was mainly to be supplied on contract to the USSR. The contract contained stringent quality specifications governing the processing of pickled herring and included a phase where the pickling occurs in a cooler facility for 28 to 45 days at a strictly controlled temperature of 0ºC to 2ºC. This is a judicial proceeding where the legislation does not provide much by way of procedural requirements and the practice of apportionment of tax is rejected. Despite its inept drafting, the definition section tends to exempt from taxation only that machinery or apparatus involved in the actual transformation or conversion of the material. Machinery or apparatus used prior or subsequent to this period of'manufacture or production' is now, by virtue of the said 1982 amendment, not tax exempt. The result of the appeal is allowed and the appellant is awarded its costs. The decision of a Provincial Tax Commissioner, as upheld by the Minister, to allow a refund on refrigerated equipment is approved but that the tax paid should not have been apportioned based on the use of the equipment in production. This would mean that tax paid relevant to the J. H. Lock contract in the amount of $41,335.50 should be refunded. This decision was based on disallowing any exemption for mechanical plumbing and electrical services provided by Germain and by determining that only portion of the refrigeration capacity was used for production purposes. The use of a cold room in the process performed a function that was part of the manufacture or production of the product.","The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act. The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product."

The function described by the appellant cannot be reasonably said to be fully part of the manufacture or production of its product so as to bring it within, subject to the definition in clause 1(ca), the exemption available in the Act. 2)The appellant contends that the Minister and the Commissioner were incorrect in not allowing the exemption for the refrigeration equipment in full. It was inappropriate to apportion the tax to be refunded if the equipment is used in any degree in the manufacturing process as opposed to other processes.","The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act. The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product."
379,Issue | Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason Document : ,"This was an appeal pursuant to s19 of the Health Services Tax Act in respect of a decision of the Provincial Tax Commission to cancel a claim for a refund of health services tax paid on certain refrigeration equipment which was installed in a new facility for pickled whole herring. This was mainly to be supplied on contract to the Soviet Union. The contract contained stringent quality specifications for the processing of pickled herring and included a phase where the pickling occurs in a cooler facility for 28 to 45 days at a strictly controlled temperature of 0ºC to 2ºC. The equipment was used in the manufacture or production of the product and was exempt from tax.

In Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes, 12th ed. (Sweet Maxwell, London, 1969) at p. 245 the author states: Similarly, statutes dealing with jurisdiction and procedure are, if they relate to the infliction of penalties, strictly construed: compliance with procedural provisions will be stringently exacted from those proceeding against the person liable to be penalised, and if there is any ambiguity or doubt it will, as usual, be resolved in his favour. This is so, even though it may enable him to escape upon technicality. Applying s. 27(3) of the Interpretation Act, 1995, conclude that the word'shall' in s. 53(1) of The Legal Profession Act, 1990, must be interpreted as imperative. It is mandatory. It was not directory. Disciplinary proceedings expose a member of the Law Society to punishments including suspension of the right to practice and disbarment. The nature of disciplinary proceedings can have devastating effect on the most valuable asset barrister, solicitor and solicitor has his or her reputation. This reinforces my view that s.53 must be strictly interpreted. The duty of respondents is the protection of the rights not only of members of the public but also the members of Law Society of Saskatchewan. This the respondents did not do to the detriment of the applicant's interests. Leave is given to speak to costs.","HELD: The last two sentences were to be substituted by the appeal was dismissed by the SCC on March 21, 1995 and the Hearing Committee set August 8, 1995 as the date for a hearing."

The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced.

Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character.

The evidence is clear that the parties treated the trade-in as the advance payment and was not a substantial portion of the fair market value. The court must be able to ascertain the probable value at the end of the Agreement, in light of the evidence that it depends on market fluctuations, cannot determine whether the value would depend upon market fluctuations. To validate the early repossession in these circumstances would defeat the intention of the legislation to afford protection to farmers against loss of property interests without compliance with legislative provisions by creditors who are governed by the Act.

The defendant was awarded costs on the basis of Column 3 of Schedule I of the Tariff of Costs. 1) Only if the Agreement is lease and is not covered by the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act would the court hold that the plaintiff is not barred by implied acceptance of the plaintiff's condition that he be released from further liability because of exclusionary clause eight of the agreement. 2) The Court would find that the agreement falls within the ambit of The Saskatchewan Farm security Act and the issue of consent is nugatory. 3) The issue was whether the consent by Mr. Poirier to give up possession was conditional upon his release from any further liability.","The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer.

The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause.

The parties framed the Agreement as a lease, but the Agreement itself uses notions such as retail financing and secured party. The primary incidents of ownership are use of the sprayer for all of its useful life with the obligation to pay the capital cost plus the cost of investment, acquisition of substantial interest and loss or gain from unusual depreciation or appreciation of the value of the painter. The second issue is whether the consent by Mr. Poirier to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. The evidence is clear that the parties treated the trade-in as the advance payment (but the Agreement does not define it in that way) even though the value does not equal the amount of advance payment; the difference being $679.33 (between $10,000.00 and $9,320.67).

On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial.

This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice.

496,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln to Her Majesty in Right of Canada. The registered owner of the vehicle was charged with trafficking in marijuana and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. Fair was found guilty of possession of the marijuana and the other charge against him was stayed. Brooks applied for relief from forfeiture. HELD: 1) Section 20(4) does not require the applicant to prove either beyond a reasonable doubt her innocence of any complicity in the designated substance offence and that she exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied the property was not likely to have been used in the commission of the offence. 2) Section 19(3) provides the court with the authority to make an order of relief from seizure if it is satisfied that the applicant is innocent of any involvement in the offence or that the property is in the possession of her co-accused. It is not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s 19(4). 3) The societal purpose of the Act, and the provisions related to the forfeiture of property, indicate that the CDSA does so both through punishment and deterrence. The forfeiture provisions are punitive to the extent that they deprive one of offence-related property, broadcasting the message that Canadian society regards designated substances offences with abhorrence. But they also introduce an element of deterrence in relation to designated substance offences. In this respect, the forfeiture provisions attach very real cost to the business of drug crime directly equivalent to the monetary value of the offences related property that is subject to forfeiture. Brooks was found not guilty on both counts. 4) The Court must first consider the gravity of an offence, the personal characteristics of the offender and the particular circumstances of the case in order to determine what range of sentences should be imposed. 5) There was no evidence adduced at trial to rebut the foregoing testimony.","The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary.

The court has authorized forfeiture of conveyances utilized to transport controlled drugs and substances. That surely cannot constitute cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, but what about those persons who may own, or have an interest in, the forfeitable conveyance and have not been convicted of the substance offence?

The registered owner of the vehicle was charged with trafficking in marijuana and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The accused was found not guilty on both counts. HELD: 1) Section 20(4) does not require the accused to prove either beyond a reasonable doubt or on balance of probabilities her innocence of any complicity in the designated substance offence or that she exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied that the property was not likely to have been used in the commission of the offence. 2) The societal purpose of the Act, and the forfeiture provisions thereof, was alluded to by Whitman J.A. in R. v. Gisby, 2000 ABCA 261 (CanLII), [2000] A.J. No. 1145 QL (Alta. C.A.): [1] The statement that ""there's some evidence that she may have had knowledge of the existence of the marihuana"" was based on the following testimony of Constable Baulkham: p. 44 My Lord, while we were up at the vehicle and we refer to Constable Nash, Ms. Brooks and myself had conversation and do ask a couple of questions if there was any other drugs in the vehicle, and she stated, 'No.' The only other comment recall her making was 'No, just in the blue tubs'.  3) The forfeiture provisions attach a very real cost to the business of drug crime directly equivalent to the monetary value of offence-related property that is subject to forfeiture, thus raising the stakes associated with the Commission of those offences. 4) Section 19(3) of The Controlled Drugs and Substance Act permits any person who claims an interest in property forfeited pursuant to ss.16(1)(a), (b) or (c) to apply for relief from forfeiture. The Court must consider, inter alia, whether the punishment is necessary to achieve a valid penal purpose.  5) It is not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s19(3), however, because Crown counsel consented to Brooks' submission being viewed as an application by her for relief.","The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1).

512,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"The plaintiff sought damages for injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The defendant placed in issue whether it was liable to the plaintiff for the injuries she sustained in this slip and fall and the degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable. 2)The evidence did not support an inference that the plaintiff's footwear caused or was a contributing factor to the fall. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance of the floor areas combined with the responsibility of each employee to carry them out were substantially the same if not identical to those considered by this Court in the Mollenhauer and Leibel group of cases. 3)The plaintiff did not know the water was there, but did know that water and other substances could be on the floor of the produce department and also knew that reasonable steps must be taken to safeguard against the very type of accident experienced by the plaintiffs. The evidence does not support a conclusion that there was a breach of the duty. 4)There were many cases that have found slippery substance such as water or produce on a floor of a grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. However, the defendant did not adduce the evidence of a material witness over whom he or she had exclusive control and did not explain it away. Such a failure is said to amount to an implied admission that the evidence would be contrary to the party's case or at least would not support it. 5)There was no evidence to support the conclusion that the defendant had breached its duty of care to an invitee.","The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor.

It was not necessary for the Crown to prove that the accused intended to collide with the automobile driven by Timothy Iron in order to prove the offence. The law doesn't require any longer than 18 months to prove dangerous driving.

The sentence appeal was brought on the ground it did not take into account mitigating circumstances, case law or sentencing principles. HELD: The appeal against conviction was dismissed.

The fine and surcharge were confirmed. 1)By applying the wrong standard, the trial judge committed an error of law, but no miscarriage of justice occurred. When the correct standard, as enunciated in Hundal, is applied to the evidence as found by the trial judge, the conviction was appropriate. 2)The application of the Stellato principle to a charge of dangerous driving under s.249(1) was an error in law. The conclusion that the Crown need only establish proof of any degree of impairment and not a marked departure from normal behaviour does not apply to a charge under s.249. Simple judgmental errors in routine driving do not constitute conduct amounting to a marked departure from the standard of care required. Mere negligence or driving without due care and attention are not sufficient. 3)The accused's evidence did not address how fast he was going (he stated his speedometer was not working) nor over what route or the time of the chase.

Both remoteness and neighbourhood effects have a role to play in the proper disposition of this type of case. Each contributes to what Gonthier J. refers to as the real and natural expectation of the landowner. The landowner overreaches if (i) the scale or intensity of the activity can be said to bring about change; (ii) the addition of new activities or the modification of old activities (albeit within the same general land use purpose) is seen by the Court as too remote from the earlier activities to be entitled to protection; (iii) the new or modified activities can be shown to create undue additional or aggravated problems for the municipality, the local authorities, or the neighbours as compared with what went before. The factors are balanced against one another.  2) It stands to reason that in attempting to accommodate","The applicant operated commercial private billiards club with liquor licence and served bar food.

The exercise of this power is predicated on the accused having had proper trial. 4)The Court cannot substitute its opinion for that of a trial court that the evidence proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt because the accused is entitled to that decision from a trial judge who have all the advantages that have been so often conceded to belong to the trial of fact.","The police observed the appellant's vehicle rub another vehicle and followed him to where he parked without difficulty.

The length of delay totaled just over 14 months, roughly the same time period the Supreme Court of Canada considered in R. v. Morin. HELD: The accused was acquitted and vindicated. The court found that the length of the delay was sufficient to raise the issue of reasonableness and the inquiry must turn to the reason why it took 14½ months to bring the accused to trial. The accused waived all of his rights explicitly or implicitly. He retained counsel and was prepared to fight the merits of the case at trial.","The defendant applied for a stay of proceedings on the basis of a violation of his right to be tried in a reasonable time.

At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts.

The accused was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving contrary to s253(b), s253 and s253 of the Criminal Code. He was arraigned on the information and requested a trial date. The Court of Appeal in each province will play a supervisory role in seeking uniformity. The prejudice can be inferred on the basis that the length of the delay is likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered given the passage of time. HELD: The accused waived his right to a trial within reasonable time.  1) The Court must determine judicially whether the institutional delay of 13 months in the context of this particular offender charged with these particular offences gives rise to an inferred prejudice, and renders his trial unfair. 2) There is a community or societal interest implicit in s.11(b). There could be no greater frustration imaginable for innocent persons charged with an offence than to be denied the opportunity of demonstrating their innocence for an unconscionable time as a result of unreasonable delays in their trial.  3) There was no evidence before the Court to suggest that the accused waived any of his rights explicitly or implicitly. Given the nature of the charges and the technical nature of Breathalyzer law, the fact that the Defense has verbalized an intention to raise s.8 and s9 Charter motions and lead evidence to the contrary, the delay was attributable to the state, and the Crown. 4) Prejudice to the accused may be inferred. The longer the delay, the easier it may be for the court to infer prejudice. 5) The court must be mindful of the rights of the accused to be given an early trial before his interests may be affected by the loss or deterioration of defense evidence.  6) On the whole of the evidence, the accused established on a balance of probabilities that he had established, on balance, that his rights to a speedy trial had been infringed.  7) It cannot be said that he deliberately or otherwise was attempting to escape trial.","The defendant applied for a stay of proceedings on the basis of a violation of his right to be tried in a reasonable time. There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial. Stay of proceedings granted. At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered."

An institutional delay of 13 months in the context of this particular offender charged with failing the Breathalyzer and impaired driving gives rise to an inferred prejudice and renders his trial unfair. The prejudice is such that it can not be remedied in any other way than by entering an inquiry. Accordingly, the proceedings are stayed. The test for unreasonable delay established by the Supreme Court of Canada and confirmed in R.v. Askov and R.V. Morin(supra) involves consideration of the following factors: (1) Length of delay is the delay sufficient to raise a question as to its reasonableness? If not, the application should be dismissed without further inquiry. (2) Waiver Even if the delay is long enough to embark on an inquiry, has the applicant waived part of it such that the remainder is not unreasonable?","The defendant applied for a stay of proceedings on the basis of a violation of his right to be tried in a reasonable time.

LePage, sitting as a Tribunal under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code, s.S. 1979, c. S-24.1 (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by Gary Kivela against his employer the City. The City and CUPE denied that the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The fact that the applicant was a casual employee with a disability at the time of his complaint was not sufficient to justify the tribunal's decision. 2)The applicant did not understand the potential to become a permanent employee with the City and was not able to access the City's disability plan in 1999. 3)There was no inherent jurisdiction in any appeal court. The applicant's disability was not a factor in his decision to resign from his employment.","This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal."

558,Conclusion | Issue | Issue | Reason | Reason Document : ,HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the tribunal had erred in law in ruling that the City was responsible for harassment against the appellant. The appellant had been employed as a casual employee for 16 years and remained casual throughout his 16 years with the City. The tribunal had improperly imparted to the appellant a vicarious liability or fiduciary duty regarding the alleged acts of harassment which either were unknown to the supervisors of the appellant or were events in which such supervisors acted appropriately in the circumstances. The fact that others passed Mr. Kivela on the casual seniority lists had two major effects. The first was that the appellant was not guaranteed the right to drive a truck while actually at work. He was still recalled and laid off according to his seniority. The second effect was that he was not able to gain a permanent position because of his disability.,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The City had met its duty to accommodate with respect to the alleged acts of harassment which either were unknown to the supervisors of the driver or were events in which such supervisors acted appropriately in the circumstances. The fact that others passed Mr. Kivela on the casual seniority lists had two major effects. First, any individual with more seniority would have priority for recall and for retention of employment at the time of layoff whether or not the available work was truck driving. The second effect of not being made permanent at the appropriate time is that he was not able to access the City's employment because of his disability. It was almost exactly the same solution that was implemented in 1982 when the City and CUPE agreed to hire the driver as a labourer and yet assign him to truck driving duties. 2)In bidding for permanent positions, seniority throughout the Department is considered. Permanent employees have priority over casual employees in bidding for any permanent position. If there are no qualified permanent employees who want to transfer into the position, priority is determined between casual employees based on seniority, amongst those who are qualified. 3)The fact that some casual employees, who started after the respondent was first hired as a casual employee and remained casual throughout his 16-year career, were able to work more hours than the respondent, pass him in total hours and thereby gain seniority ahead of him.","This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE.

560,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 268(b) of the Criminal Code. The complainant was the 16 year old daughter of the accused. She was living at the complainant's house with her mother when the accused drove his truck dangerously close to her and she fell on the ground. She testified that the accused backed up the truck and pushed her down twice and kicked her in the head. She said she fell down and the accused fell on top of her. The evidence of tire marks on the driveway raised the issue of whether the accused operated a motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public. In order to convict the accused of this charge the Crown must prove both the mens rea and actus reus. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. 1) Every one commits an offence to the satisfaction of a reasonable doubt. The Crown has proven the guilt of each and every ingredient of this offence to my satisfaction beyond a reasonably doubt. 2) The evidence was seriously attacked on cross-examination and on several occasions gave evidence differed substantially from his previous statement to the RCMP. He claims his memory is better now than it was on August 21, 2003 and that he was not given time to think when he gave the statement. His evidence was accepted as an accurate account of the events as they unfolded. 3) There was no doubt that the injuries to the complainant were accidental and the result of intervening events. There is no doubt the bruises sustained by the complainant may have resulted from her fall on the concrete driveway and some may have been occasioned by Darnell when she accidentally stepped on her mother's face while attempting to get her up and into the house. However, close examination of the photographs in exhibit P-2 demonstrates a series of bruises and cuts, the combination of which together with the evidence, points to kicks and blows inflicted by the accused and not all of the bruises can be explained in this fashion.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code; assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Code; dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Code; and two counts of assault contrary to s. 266(a) of the Code. HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict. 2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant. The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered. The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct.

The applicant sought a termination of spousal support or alternatively a decrease in support with a fixed date for termination. HELD: 1) The respondent was entitled and continues to be entitled by virtue of the years of support paid to date and the applicant's sole responsibility for their child since 1996. The court found that the extent of the spouse's obligation to meet the other's financial needs depends on the length of the relationship, the ability to pay, any repartnering of the former spouses, and the other obligations of the parties.  2) The applicant's income has increased to some extent, in all other respects her circumstances are the same as they were at the time of the granting of the divorce. Although the applicant had some employment since retirement, his income is reduced. There may well be occasions for support to be indefinite in the case of a disabled spouse. However, the original order was not time-limited and he could find no rationale for doing so as her need continued based on her disability.","The husband applied to vary a corollary relief judgment in order to either terminate spousal support or decrease it with a fixed date for termination. The parties were married for twelve years and had been divorced for seven years.

The wife had serious long-term mental illness and was unable to manage employment. The parties' teenage son was now solely in the husband's care. Spousal support reduced to $300 per month payable for a further three years at which point it will terminate.

572,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The complainant was employed as a clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her position in 1998 and was employed at the clerk's office for about a year prior to the charge. During that time, she was required to retrieve files pertaining to certain persons who had cases in court because documents had to be prepared in relation to the accused's appearance. She was also required to specifically describe a number of incidents that took place over a period of about year and then year after the last of the incidents had taken place and believe her recollection was accurate. HELD: The Court found that the credibility of the complainant was determined to be based on the following factors: 1)Whether the witness was honestly endeavouring to tell the truth; (b)whether the witness is biased, reticent and evasive. Whether the witness's capacity to remember; (c)the relationship that the witness had with the accused; and (d)The relationship between the witness and the accused was tantamount to allowing the Crown to enter the statement as evidence. The ultimate question is not which side ought to be believed but whether, on the evidence that accept, the Crown has proven the elements of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.  2)The evidence clearly indicated that the accused pursued her to make conversation, much of it sexual in nature. Even the evidence indicated that he did not encourage the conversation and that she did not want to participate in any of the conversations.","The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code.

The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic.

The defence argued that s. 589 of the Criminal Code should be considered a bar to the admissibility because it preserves the traditional hearsay exceptions while avoiding any unnecessary arbitrariness of the exceptions that may apply in a particular situation. The trial judge also had an overriding discretion to exclude the evidence if its prejudicial value outweighs its intrinsic value.","Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death.

In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify.

In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath."

Only one of the defendants was responsible for the decision to arrest the plaintiff and was solely involved in arresting him. HELD: 1)Credibility.

The evidence of the plaintiff was at odds with what the other witnesses say and because her evidence did not distinguish between him and the accused as to who did what.","The plaintiff seeks damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received cut to his scalp. He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning. The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service. The City of Saskatoon is their employer. HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle. The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount. It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements. 1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge. The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty. The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully. The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty. 2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help. Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa. Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty. There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty. 3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions. The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty.

The effect of granting a judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained therein. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff in the amount of $214,600 does not represent debt or liquidated demand as that phrase is contemplated in Rule 129. 4) There is no dispute as to the nature of the plaintiff’s investment in the defendant corporation.

588,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"The plaintiff was run down in a parking lot as he was pursuing a shoplifter. The van that struck him was being used as the getaway vehicle in the shoplifting heist and was being driven by a second individual. The plaintiff suffered serious personal injuries. Allstate joined the proceeding as a third party under the provisions of s. 133(14) of the Insurance Act whereby it is defending the action against its insured Jerome Thomas under reservation of rights. HELD: The plaintiff's evidence was replete with inconsistencies, contradictions, admitted poor memory and admitted lies in his earlier discovery evidence. The only clear evidence before the court was that the defendant sold the van to the plaintiff himself. The defendant admitted to selling the van for $500 and that he traded it for drugs. He also admitted that he had no recollection of having either lost or decided not to cash the victim's $500 cheque as an explanation for having no record of it. The facts in this case are very much in dispute which necessitates a number of credibility findings to be made.","The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter. The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages.

The flight was delayed for approximately an hour and half at the airport as a result of several evolving mechanical difficulties referred to by the pilot as 'creeping delay' resulting in uncomfortable conditions on the airplane for the passengers. The defendants opposed the certification application on the basis that none of the plaintiffs suffered bodily injury, which is not admitted but denied, the bodily injury was not caused by an accident within the meaning of the Montreal Convention. HELD: The certification application was granted with the consent of the plaintiff's counsel. The test to be applied in certification applications is similar to those used in applications to strike a statement of claim as disclosing no cause of action. All allegations of fact pleaded are to be accepted as true and pleadings will only be struck if it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs cannot succeed. The plaintiff should be reluctant to deny his or her day in court.  1) The plaintiff's claim for damages arising in relation to a flight against the defendant was not brought pursuant to s. 4(2)(a) of the Convention. The defendant was liable for damage sustained in case of death or bodily injury of a passenger upon condition only that the accident which caused the death or injury took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.  2) Although the plaintiff argued that if ever there was a case that should be certified, this case was it as it involved a defined group of passengers in a confined space, being an airplane over a small period of time, the defendants opposed. 3) There is ample case law with regard to its predecessor, the Warsaw Convention, as to its exclusive remedy for passengers. It is not very high onus on the plaintiffs to satisfy the Court that the pleadings disclose cause of actions.","The plaintiff applies for certification pursuant to The Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight from the Dominican Republic to Regina.

The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking.

600,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"The parties met, married, made children and separated in 2005. The petitioner mother has custody of the three children. The respondent father is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins. They have not settled division of matrimonial property. HELD: The Court held that the most representative and fairest method of determining the self-employed father's income is a three-year average under the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The Court found that in 2003, 2004 and 2005 the income of the father is as follows: $29,983; in 2004, $3,829; in 2005, $2,733; and in 2006, $5,733. 1) The Court was not prepared to add back to income in any of the years the amounts claimed in the father's personal income are set out in the Guidelines.  2) The court found that the holding of trial was a more efficient and cheaper method of coming to the conclusion regarding the issue of maintenance than ongoing negotiation or pre-trial. Each party achieved partial success in their approach.","The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount."

HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year.

This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business."

HELD: 1) The respondent's application for retroactive child support was dismissed. The court found that the respondent had not engaged in blameworthy conduct. 2) The petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005, inclusive, is not so dramatic in my opinion as to constitute blamable conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. 3) There was no agreement or obligation to disclose. The respondent has been content to accept $380.00 per month as fair level of child support for both children since 2003. Since 2003 the respondent's income is not relevant in that he has been the custodial parent. However, the increase in the petitioner’s income over that time period is. To order retroactive support of $4,322.00, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in his/her category. 4) The court was unable to find any reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier.","The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category.

The mother failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself or the child. HELD: The father was granted sole custody of the child and custody was granted to the mother. The court reviewed the evidence at trial and found that it was in the child's best interests to move with the father to the Yukon, given the mother's willingness and ability to facilitate the father's application for joint custody and shared parenting. The Court reviewed the circumstances of the case and concluded that there had not been a material change in the circumstances which existed at the time of the Original Custody Judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties, which would be necessary, was possible.","The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother?

In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply.

Following the pragmatic and functional approach referred to in the judgment, it is clear the standard is one of reasonableness. 3) After fully canvassing all of the facts, the board of arbitration came to this final conclusion: It may be true that Vice-Chief Watson did not in fact play a role in the decision that Dr. Stonechild should not be on the program.

The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement. The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly."

Nothing in the Union by-laws precludes the plaintiff from seeking relief from the Courts before making a final appeal to the CUPE National office. 4) The plaintiff is engaged in litigation respecting the Union.

In that respect, the contest in this case is indistinguishable. 6) The Court has jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff's claim and his application under Queen’s Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment.

The court dismissed the action. 1) The plaintiff was involved in Union related litigation and was entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. The dispute was not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. It would be inequitable to prevent the plaintiff from bringing this application in the absence of a clear and enforceable provision excluding his access to the Courts.  2) The union's obligation to place the names of its unemployed members on the unemployment board in appropriate sequence did not arise out of its statutory duty of fair representation. Rather, it arose out of the Working Rules and Bylaws applicable to all union members. The union appropriately felt obligated to protect its officers from actions done in the course of their office that made them the subject of the plaintiff's litigation. As a result, the union took steps to pass a by-law which would indemnify the officers. 3) In this case the union found that it was being assailed by the plaintiff and was being drawn into litigation. It appropriately felt obliged to protect the officers from these actions. 4) The dispute in the Fourth Action was indistinguishable from the dispute in McNairn. It was clear that it would be clearly wrong and an error in law to interpret the indemnities clause so as to obligate the plaintiff to fund the plaintiff in his activity of suing the Union and its officers. Nothing in the Union by-laws precludes the defendant from seeking relief from the Courts before making a final appeal to the CUPE National office. 5) The essential nature of the debate between Taylor and the Union relates to the interpretation of indemnity by-the-laws and, more to the point, the Court should decline to become involved in the dispute because the Union is a voluntary association and is entitled to resolve its own disputes. 6) The Court found that in disposing of a summary judgment motion the Court is merely upholding a basic term of the membership contract that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. 7) The issue here is whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction over an action for damages brought against the union by one of its members alleging breach of contract by the union in violating the hiring hall rules governing the allocation of jobs among unemployed union members and entitling him to damages. 8) The Union argued that the Court must not lend its process to the fourth action as the plaintiff has available to him","The plaintiff is an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Union.

He is entitled entitled to a relief under Subsection 178. 2)The bankruptcy judge did not question the bankrupt's good faith in past dealings with his loans. However, he may have a monthly surplus of about $170. It would take many years for him to contribute enough to significantly reduce the liability.","The applicant school teacher asked to be discharged from $20k in student loan debts under s.178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. He had filed consumer proposal in 2001, which he completed successfully in 2006. He earned $50,874 (gross) per annum; was at the top of his pay scale; had two young children; and his wife worked half-time position at Aliant, earning $16,272 year. There were daycare costs when the wife worked, and the applicant's transportation costs were high (but reasonable). The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards. The applicant did not have any credit either. Their home had little, if any, equity. The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan. Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability. If the application were refused, he would have to consider bankruptcy."

The chambers judge did not make a palpable and overriding error in law, nor did he err in law and his conclusion was supported by the evidence before him on this application. There was no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge in relation to child support orders. The respondent's expenses were ordinary and did not exceed what the appellant could reasonably cover.","This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside.

The contract was frustrated by the unforseen soil conditions which prevented the drilling of ten foot depth pile holes for concrete piles. The plaintiff intended to construct a custom made glass wall sunroom. The defendant refused to supply concrete pilings, saying they would not guarantee their work if they were used. The court awarded the plaintiff $176.22 for the sum of $2,200.00 to the defendant, Ens' being the balance between the deposit and the apportionment of damages pursuant to the Frustrated Contracts Act, as well as the costs of the project. The defendants acted in good faith and the plaintiff was able to mitigate its losses by salvaging parts from the Ens sunroom material.","The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home. They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith.

The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time."
660,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"FIAT. The parties, who were never married, had two children, Kayden and Nolan, born in 2003 and December, 2004. The respondent was employed as a hotel supervisor and worked two weeks a week for two weeks followed by one week off. The petitioner sought an order that would enable him to exercise increased access to the children born of his relationship with the respondent. HELD: 1) The court found no evidence of any material change in circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule.  2) The petitioner's work schedule had not changed. He still works two weeks of 12 hour days (8:00 a.m. 8:00 p.m.) followed by week off and contact with the father would be significantly reduced. 3) This is the second time access issues have come before the Court. The affidavits filed show a significant amount of animosity between the parties. It appears unlikely that they will be able to agree on much, if anything. Granting specific access for holiday periods in the distant future acts as a disincentive for the parties to resolve matters within a reasonable time period of time. 4) The respondent resisted any order that increased access for the 2008 Christmas period or for any of the holiday periods subsequent to that as requested by the petitioner. The children are five and four years old. It is most likely that the petitioner would be at work for virtually all of the children's waking hours. Contact with the mother would be increased only marginally, if at all, during these periods. 5) Applications to alter interim access orders are not the answer. Moving the matter quickly to pre-trial and/or trial is.","FIAT: A previous interim order detailed specific access in the period leading up to pre-trial or trial, however more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial. The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order. HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.  The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children. The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order."

In determining that effective date, the Board Adjudicator relied upon s.228 of the Workers’ Compensation Act, S.N.S. 1994-95. Counsel for the Board acknowledges that in order for its appeal to succeed, it must show that entitlement to chronic pain benefit involves recalculation within the meaning of s 228. However, it is not persuaded that it does. When the new Act came into effect in February 1996, chronic pain was not compensable. There was no entitlement whatsoever for benefits for chronic pain prior to the Chronic Pain Regulations in 2004. Hence, there could be no benefit which would be recalculated.","The Workers' Compensation Board appealed the effective date of the chronic pain benefits awarded to a worker.

676,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"This was an appeal of a decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal and dealt with child support ordered under Provincial legislation. The parties' oldest child was not a dependent child of the marriage at the time the application was filed. However, the parties' corollary relief judgment provided for a shared parenting arrangement and equal sharing of all special and extraordinary expenses. The respondent argued that retroactive support was not justified for the reasons given in Martell v. Height. HELD: 1) The court did not have jurisdiction to consider the application of Ms. Niles for retroactive variation of child support and a readjustment of the claim for section 7 expenses. 2) The parties clearly left the charge of their parents in April 2008. He established an independent household without the consent, agreement, approval or financial support of his parents. He did not seek any of these from his parents when doing so. The chambers judge made no finding of fact that would support such an application. 3) Given the issue of the court's jurisdiction it is not necessary for the court to consider whether the respondent is guilty of blameworthy conduct. 4) There is nothing in the S. (D.B.) decision which restricts the declared principles regarding retroactive child support to basic child support. It will not always be possible for court to enforce an unfulfilled child support obligation.","The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation.

677,Issue | Issue | Reason | Reason | Conclusion Document : ,"The parties divorced in 2001 and Corollary Relief Judgment was granted in 2001. The parties have two children, aged 16 and 19. The respondent applies retroactively for retroactive child support and s.7 expenses for the parties' older child. The mother's application to vary is retroactive to the date when the respondent gave the respondent effective notice of his intention to seek an increase in support payments. HELD: 1) The court does not have jurisdiction to consider the application of the mother for a retroactive variation of child support or a readjustment of the claim for section 7 expenses. 2) There is nothing in the S. (D.B.S.) decision which restricts the declared principles regarding retroactivity to basic child support. It is clear from the various authorities cited by counsel that courts recognize jurisdiction under s. 2(1) of the Divorce Act to make orders for the support of children over the age of 16 during their period of dependency. However, this presumption may be rebutted where change in circumstances is shown to be sufficiently pronounced that the payor parent was no longer reasonable in relying on the order and not disclosing revised ability to pay. 3) The respondent's conduct could militate against retroactive award if it was found to be blameworthy conduct. 4) The Court must be open to ordering retroactive support where fairness to children dictates it, but should also be mindful that fairness to payor parents often demands.","The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children.

688,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"This was an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant sought to set aside the transaction under various heads of contract law including duress, undue influence, unconscionability, equitable fraud and mistake. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The central issues were whether the central facts on the terms of the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and conduct of the Clements was supported by probative evidence. There was no doubt that it was. In those circumstances it is impossible for us as a court of appeal to interfere with these findings, even had we wished to. On these facts no possible attack on the contract exists.","This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction.

The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made.

The learned trial judge found that the appellant's observations concerning slurred speech were not part of conscripted evidence which would place the administration of justice into disrepute.

The trial judge did not resort to conjecture or speculation as suggested by counsel for the appellant. The evidence as statement of fact was clearly not admissable to prove that the accused was in fact drunk as it was conclusary in nature. 2)Although the results of roadside sobriety tests are not adduced by the trial judge, there is sufficient indicia of impairment from the evidence of the three police officers to provide an evidentiary basis for the learned judge's finding of impairment.

In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer.

732,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,The accused was charged with aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the penitentiary. The accused was transferred from Stony Mountain to Saskatchewan Penitentiary in 2007. He admitted that he was on 'gang range' in Manitoba and that he believed that the assault was about to happen. HELD: The Court found that the accused's actions against the victim were done in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code. The Court concluded that the injuries inflicted by the accused were not serious enough to be considered 'aggravated' under s. 21(1)(b) and that his belief that he could not otherwise preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm was objectively foreseeable by him as a result of the actions of the other joint participants for the purpose of determining which acts caused which injuries.,"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary.

The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not."

744,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"The applicant applies for judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. The applicant is a Roma and Romanian national who has resided in Canada since his arrival here exactly eight years ago. He was arrested in October 2002 while driving his car in Romania. He did not remain at the scene of the collision and was later apprehended and he admitted consuming alcohol and striking the victim. Romania charged him with criminally negligent homicide and left the scene. He appealed the committal order, arguing that his status as a Convention refugee affords an arguable basis for submitting to the Minister that he should not be surrendered to Romania. Romania opposed the application. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1)The applicant has not proven that he will surrender himself into custody and his rights of appeal in that country are now exhausted. The Crown concedes that Mr. Cretu has met this low threshold. 2)It is common sense that the risk of non-appearance in extradition cases is higher in light of the fact the detainee does not wish to be returned to the United States. However, there is no reason to consider the third test under s.679(3)(c).  3)The application for interim judicial release was dismissed.  4)The court found that the applicant had not met the low threshold on which it must limit the assumption of risk of a non-earance more severely than the Court would do in an application by an offender made directly under the Code.","The applicant applied for judicial interim release under s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence.

The applicant is a Roma and Romanian national who has resided in Canada since his arrival here exactly eight years ago. He was arrested in October 2002 while driving his car in Romania. He did not remain at the scene of the collision and was later apprehended and he admitted consuming alcohol and striking the victim. Romania charged him with criminally negligent homicide and leaving the scene. He appealed the decision under s. 40 of the Code. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1)The applicant has not established that he will surrender himself into custody pending the Minister's decision on surrender. The risk of non-appearance is such that it cannot be sufficiently mitigated by release conditions which, on the materials before the Court, might be ameliorated by his release.  2)The respondent's status as a Convention refugee affords an arguable basis for submitting to the Minister that he should not be surrendered to Romania.  3)There is no reason to consider the third test under s679(3)(c). It is sufficient that the applicant has a long-term relationship and his common law spouse has agreed to act as his surety. He has been gainfully employed by the same employer since 2009.

The accused was sentenced to 12 months closed custody followed by a period of probation with credit for pre-sentence detention on the basis of two days for each day spent in detention. HELD: A period of custody is necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. The young person did not oppose the Crown's application for a sentence of a custodial sentence of 25 days, 12 months of custody and 6 months community supervision. The court designated the aggravated assault as a serious violent offence pursuant to ss. 42(9) and s. 487.051 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act.","The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court.

He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused.

HELD: The accused was found not guilty of both charges. The Court found no breach of s. 8 or s.9 of The Charter and the Certificate of Analyses was therefore admissible. The only issue to resolve was whether the officer reasonably could have only a mere suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body.  1) Based on the totality of the above evidence, the Crown must establish that the search was authorized by law, the law was reasonable and the breath demand was reasonable. 2) Any potential violation of the accused's rights would fall toward the lower end of the spectrum. The admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The breach was not the result of wilful or blatant disrespect by the officer nor was it a result of impaired driving. The accused displayed very significant symptoms of impairment and drove in a fashion indicative of marked departure from the norm.

The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol.

In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body.

The accused argued that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The Court found that the accused's Charter rights were violated and that the admission of the evidence in the face of a breach of s. 254(3) did not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court concluded that the officer's belief was honestly held and subjectively valid.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded."

McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence.

In his statement of claim the representative plaintiff pled that he and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of the defendant. The defendant responded by seeking an order pursuant to Rule 173(c) of the Queen's Bench Rules striking the action on the ground that it was devoid of merit. They also opposed the certification of the within actions on the basis that the relationship between them and the plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and non-client. Dismissing the application and certifying the action as a class action, that the chambers judge erred in failing to properly apply the Anns test when determining whether a cause of action is a common issue within the meaning of s. 6(1)(c).","The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class.

772,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"FIAT. The respondent sought to vary two orders issued in 1998 and 2001. He was 72 years old and practising internal medicine in the United States. He is looking to retire in the next few years and does not want the issue of child support to interfere with his plans. HELD: 1) The arrears were fixed at $183,746. The court found that the respondent did not have the ability to pay child support because he had not been paying it for 25 years. He should have paid $2,589 per month based on his income over the years. This was a reasonable income level to be imputed to the respondent for present purposes. 2) The respondent was ordered to pay $1,683 in monthly child support and $249 per month in s. expenses. 3) There was no dispute as to the calculations as to his income. He did not owe child support at the time he stopped paying it. 4) The Court found that in the absence of some special circumstance, the respondent's child support obligations should only be expunged where the payee has established on a balance of probabilities that he or she cannot pay, and that his future income is only relevant to his considerations as to whether ought to exercise his discretion to rescind or reduce the arrear.","The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927."

He is looking to retire in the next few years and does not want the issue of child support arrears to interfere with his plans. HELD: 1) The respondent was ordered to pay $1,683 in monthly child support and $249 per month in s. expenses. In the last six months of 2001, he paid $383. He paid $2,335 in 2002, $3,742 in 2003 and $298 in 2004. He did not have the ability to pay child support because he could have taken employment that paid him at least $110,000 a year. He knew that he was expected to maximize his earning capacity but simply chose not to. Now, some 12 years later, he argues that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income. The fact remains that rather than seek employment that could pay him handsomely, he chose to flail away in private practice for years and earn much less than he otherwise would have. The law as it pertains to imputed incomes has not changed. 2) In the absence of some special circumstance the respondent's child support obligations should only be expunged where the payee has established on a balance of probabilities that he cannot pay them in the future. There is no undue hardship to the parties. 3) The child remains a child of the marriage until order of the Court of Appeal or agreement of the parties (Smith v. Smith, 2007 SKQB 294). 4) The father was entitled to child support in the amount of $186,000. 5) The court found that the father had not been paying child support for 25 years.

Aggravating factors included lack of remorse, sleeping complainant, and small degree of violence. The Court of Appeal found that the accused was at a low risk to re-offend and imposed a sentence of 10 years incarceration followed by 12 months probation.

The respondent used physical force which distinguishes this case from the cases of fleeting touching. The circumstances are far more egregious than the circumstances here. In R. v. Ashby, the accused appealed from conviction and sentence for sexual assault. The court found that in major sexual assaults involving adult offenders and victims, three years would be considered starting point from which a sentencing judge should start, increasing or decreasing the term according the aggravating and mitigating factors. 2)The accused's record establishes a pattern of sexual assaults. The Crown bears the onus of proving any fact not admitted. It is the position of the Crown that the record of Mr. Michelin established a pattern. The record of the accused establishes a consistent pattern. 3)The Court found that sexual assault on children is at least as high in terms of gravity, if not higher, than sexual assaults upon adults.","HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault.

782,Conclusion | Issue | Issue | Reason | Reason Document : ,"HELD: The sole issue was whether the plaintiffs and the lawyers with the Phillips Co. should be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiff because of a conflict of interest. The only issue in this case is whether the lawyer's new retainer is sufficient to rebut the presumption that he or she is acting for a particular client. The first issue is readily disposed of on the facts. The statement of claim was issued on June 3, 2013. The Holgates' legal counsel first broached the conflict of interests concern with the plaintiff in early July 2013. Their application followed August 13th when a negotiated approach failed. Simply put, there was no delay. The second part of the Martin test is whether or not the lawyer possesses confidential information that raises a risk of prejudice. HELD: 1) Even if the defendants' failure to raise the conflict issue in earlier proceedings is relevant to their motion in the present action, delay alone is not determinative. The two lines of argument are not isolated from each other, as the court must take into consideration all relevant factors. 2) The law is clear that the duty to avoid conflicts is simply an adjunct to a lawyer's underlying duty to refrain from using confidential information received from former clients. In practice, Rule 2.04(10) operates to prevent situations from arising which carry a heightened risk of breach of confidentiality. It has long been settled that there need not be a formal retainer in order for the solicitor-client relationship to be constituted. 3) The former client need only satisfy the court of its broad relevance to the proceedings at hand and of the risk posed if it passed into the hands of the other party. 4) The court must consider the matter with an eye to and concern for the administration of justice and any appearance of impropriety.",HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.
783,Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,"HELD: The sole issue was whether the plaintiffs and the lawyers with the Phillips Co. should be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiff because of a conflict of interest. The issues were whether the parties were ethically bound by the Rules of the Law Society to refrain from acting against a former client. The first issue is whether the lawyer's new retainer is sufficient to rebut the presumption that a solicitor-client relationship arises as a matter of law. As the plaintiffs possessed relevant confidential information from their former client which could prejudice them in the within action, disqualification is generally automatic. The second issue is if the lawyer has relevant information attributable to a solicitor and client relationship relevant to the matter at hand. HELD: 1) Even if the defendants' failure to raise the conflict issue in earlier proceedings is relevant to their motion in the present action, delay alone is not determinative. 2) The two lines of argument are not isolated from each other, as the court must take into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances including the fact that the parties' relationship was purely procedural and benign in nature and not ultimately relevant. 3) The court must consider the matter with an eye to and concern for the administration of justice and any appearance of impropriety. 4) While it is true the defendants failed to raise conflict of interests concerns prior to issuance of the plaintiff's statement of claim and that the matter was preceded by writ of possession application and analogous proceedings involving the Holgates, the fact remains that the lawyers within his law firm are ethically obliged by the rules of the law Society to avoid acting against former clients in the same or any related matter.  5) While the plaintiffs were left with the impression and expectation that the law firm was acting for both sides, their impression and impression was reasonably held. The lawyer was not discharging the onus borne in these circumstances. The door should not be shut completely on solicitor who wishes to discharge this heavy burden.",HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants.

The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The accused provided his name and address to the police officer by way of driver's licence and his birthday was September 24, 1990. The officer warned him that if he lied about his identity, he could be charged with obstructing a peace officer. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1)An in-court identification of the accused was not necessary; it was sufficient that the individual with whom the officer dealt dealt had surrendered to the Court as demonstrated through the Appearance Notice. 2)Service on a lawyer may not satisfy the notice requirement if counsel never agreed to accept service. 3)The Certificate of Disqualification or Prohibition was not admissible.

Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice.

All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel. Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence.

The notion of 'block billings' arising in argument and not being based on concerns expressed by the applicant is problematic.

The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice. The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances.

The force used by the accused was objectively no more than necessary given the nature and quality of the threat, the force used in response to it and the characteristics of the parties involved in terms of size, strength, gender, age and other immutable characteristics.  2) The defence of self-defence is constrained by principles of proportionality, necessity and reasonableness. In dealing with s. 25(1) and s. 34(1), the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that any one of these four elements is not necessary. 3) The trial judge failed to take into account certain factors in his analysis of whether the level of force was objectively reasonable, such as whether the officer used more force than was necessary, whether the accused's belief was reasonable on a subjective or objective basis, whether there was any doubt that a reasonable person in the position of the appellant might be expected to employ.","HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge.

The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety.

She enlisted the assistance of the Moose Jaw Police Service to investigate whether the accused's children were in need of protection and if necessary to apprehend those children. The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of The Child and Family Services Act. HELD: The Court found that the accused did not have any lawful authority to enter the complainant's apartment suite to effect and arrest the accused. The Court also concluded that the police officer had not breached s. 13.1 by entering the complainant’s apartment suite and that he was not in hot pursuit of the accused and that his entrance to that suite would be contrary to her section rights unless that entrance and search was determined to be lawful under some other legal authority. The court found that it was open to the Crown and the Ministry to establish that any contact of the children with the accused was harmful to the children and they were immediately in need.,"HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached. Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home. The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house. The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights. The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children. The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights. The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence."

The mere fact that the mother had contact with him on this date is not sufficient to allow the Court to conclude that the children were either in need or apprehension.

She was arrested within seconds of encountering the accused that he had a reasonable suspicion for an ASD demand. He had no opportunity to observe the accused. He made the demand before asking the accused if she consumed any liquor. The accused spent some time in the washroom; she spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel; it took nine minutes to take the first sample. The delay may have prejudiced the accused as there was no indication that the accused admitted to drinking at the time of driving.

The police officer's explanation for not being able to leave the scene till some thirty-five minutes after he arrested the accused was not satisfactory. 2) There was no compelling reason, or need, to wait for the tow truck especially when the time from arrival at the police station to the time the tests were taken was not satisfactorily explained.","HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice. The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it; and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained. However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately.

The father argues she is person of sufficient interest with respect to the children. She argues she and the father should have joint custody of the children but her home be the children's primary residence. HELD: 1) The court found that the grandmother was a person with sufficient interest. The designation was made pursuant to s. 6 of The Children's Law Act, 1997, c C-8.2. It is clear there were concerns regarding the father's use of alcohol and drugs prior to the mother's death. However, the father was granted supervised access with the children for three weekends in a row with no access on the fourth weekend.

A young flag person standing near their vehicle was severely injured.  3)The accused was convicted of failing to recognize stopped vehicles in the active construction zone and to allow sufficient distance to bring his vehicle to a safe stop before colliding with the rear of the Cobalt.","The accused was found guilty of three counts of dangerous driving causing death, contrary to s. 249(4) of the Criminal Code, and one count of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, contrary to s. 249(3) of the Code. During his employment as professional truck driver, the accused had driven into construction zone on highway and hit another vehicle that had been stopped. The three teenage occupants of the vehicle were killed and flag person was severely injured as result of the collision. The accused was sure that he had not been asleep at the time of the accident but felt that he had not been paying attention. He had not noticed any of the signs posted at 100-metre intervals after the start of the construction zone 1.6 km south of the accident. The accused was 41 years of age. He had obtained his A-1 driver’s licence in 2009 and had clean driving abstract. He was married and had three children. He had recently been diagnosed with mild sleep apnea. He expressed remorse to the victim’s families and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.| HELD: The accused was sentenced to three years in imprisonment on the first count and three years concurrent for the second and third counts, and one year concurrent to the other counts on the fourth count. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment. The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person. The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone. The mitigating factors were that the accused pled guilty and expressed profound remorse. He had not been drinking and had a clear driving record. The accused was at low risk to re-offend."

832,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion Document : ,"HELD: The Court found the petitioner's Federal Child Support Guidelines to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal support of $5,250.00 per month. The petitioner had not taken a single vacation in the preceding two years and claimed divorce and joint custody of the child and child support and an unequal division of family home and property. The respondent, who was working as an intern, had no plans to return to Canada after leaving for a four-year medical fellowship, and had intended instead to become a general practitioner at the conclusion of his residency. The child had been attending classes at the hospital for the past two years, but had not been able to attend classes. The mother had recently returned from a two-year residency program in the United States and had been unable to find employment. HELD: 1) The Court held that the petitioner was entitled to an additional $500 per month toward the National Bank line of credit.  2) The petitioner's income for 2014 was estimated at approximately $309,700.00. The Court concluded that the respondent's ability to support the child while he was working was the primary driver of his decision to move to Canada. The court found that the child had a better chance of obtaining employment in the field of medicine if he could continue to live with the mother. The children had a good relationship with the father and were able to spend quality time together. The father was also entitled to some additional time with the child. 3) The child's educational needs were met and the child's needs met.","HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period."

The respondent filed an answer and counter petition opposing the petitioner’s claim for shared parenting and an equal division of the family home and property and prohibiting the respondent from removing D.K. from the jurisdiction. The petitioner had been working full-time for the past four years and was earning an income of $20,000 per year. HELD: 1) The petitioner was awarded custody of the child. The child was to remain with the petitioner for the duration of his stay in Canada.  2) The respondent was to pay interim support for the child of $7,199 per month inclusive of child and spousousal support, which sum is transferred directly from his RBC account to the respondent. 3) The court found that the petitioner had not taken a single vacation in the preceding two years and that his income for 2014 was approximately $309,700. This was due to the fact that the respondent had returned from a two-year medical fellowship in the United States. 4) The child had been attending Grade 5 classes at Argyle School since September 2013.
