1990canlii4096.txt,"This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","The applicant sought an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against him in respect of charges brought against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada. The respondent had been convicted of professional misconduct and was seeking an order restraining the respondent from taking any further proceedings. The applicant applied for an order in the nature of prohibition. HELD: The application for an interim order was granted. The application was not allowed to proceed pending the outcome of an application for certiorari. The court found that the American Cyanamid test was not applicable and that the court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very special circumstances. The Court found that in Ripley v. Investment Dealer Association of Nova Scotia, the test in American Cyanamate does not apply. The only test in this case is that the applicant would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is granted.  1)The application for interim injunction was quashed by the disciplinary panel. 2)The applicant was found guilty of professional conduct. The trial judge imposed an injunction of the type requested now, that is, restraining the Bar Society from ordering disciplinary action against McFetridge in the event that he was found to be guilty of Professional misconduct. 3)The Court reviewed the evidence and concluded that the respondent would suffer serious harm if he were to be required to attend the hearing. 4)The respondent was found not guilty of any of the charges."
1991canlii2535.txt,"This was an appeal from a conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, a push dagger, contrary to s.89(a) of the Criminal Code. For the appellant, that the trial judge failed to consider whether the knife fit the definition of a weapon under s.2 of the Criminal Code and, in addition, failed to satisfy himself that the accused intended to use the dagger to cause injury or death or for the purposes of threatening or intimidating. The matter was remitted for a new trial.","This was an appeal from conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, a push dagger contrary to s.89(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge did not consider the definition of weapon as set out in s.2 of the Code. He founded the conviction solely on the basis the push dagger was concealed on the accused person. HELD: Appeal allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The trial judge failed to consider the essential intent element of the offence. 2)The appeal was allowed and the new trial was ordered."
1991canlii2608.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision which overturned the respondent's convictions on charges of operating overweight vehicles contrary to s.172 of the Motor Vehicle Act. The Court had overturned the convictions on the ground that the reverse onus provision of s.172, respecting the accuracy of the scale, violated s. 11(d) of the Charter. Allowing the appeal and restoring the convictions, that the trial judge did not rely on the prima facie effect of the Crown's evidence, but rather had ample evidence concerning the accuracy of the scales upon which to rely.","The respondents were convicted, after their trials, and fined for operating overweight vehicles on the Bedford Highway. The offence with which each was charged was a violation of s. 172 of the Motor Vehicle Act, then s. 192 of the Regulations, and now s. 193 of the Highway. Dismissing the appeals, that s. 174 (now s.193) was in violation of the Charter because it completely relieves the Crown of any requirement whatsoever to prove accuracy of the scales."
1994canlii5206.txt,"The Plaintiff, aged 72 years, claimed ongoing damages resulting from a whiplash injury suffered in a motor vehicle accident 5 years earlier. She had been involved in previous accidents and also suffered from osteoporosis and hypertension. She displayed some symptoms of mental illness, including paranoid delusions. HELD: The Plaintiff's evidence as to her condition was not accepted. Based upon the opinion of her doctor, the court found partial disability of 3 months, and that her symptoms were fully resolved within 1 year. The court awarded general damages of $18,000.00.  The court refused to award damages for loss of housekeeping capacity, given the Plaintiff's disability prior to the accident.",The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident. Liability was not in issue. The plaintiff suffered a whiplash injury which was substantially resolved over a period of about one year following the accident. The Court did not accept any evidence tendered in respect of her loss of housekeeping capacity as it would appear that she was substantially disabled prior to the accident and was substantially injured prior to this accident.
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation sought to set aside the default judgment on the basis of an irregularity claim. The defendant entered into a letter agreement with the plaintiff to pay 50% of every energy savings enjoyed for a period of sixty months, provided such savings were the result of whatever of the defendant's recommendations were approved by and implemented by the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought to recover the default judgement and for an order dismissing the action on the grounds of res judicata or abuse of process. The court dismissed the plaintiff's application to set up a defence and found that the defendant had failed to establish any reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. The Court dismissed the defendant subsidiary request for directions pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 25.01 to set off the default and for the issue of appropriate forum."
1996canlii7150.txt,"FIAT. The defendant had been held in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. The issue here was responsibility for the legal costs incurred by the plaintiff to compel production. Her solicitor/client bill exceeded $50,000 including very large disbursements as a trustee was appointed to preserve the property and the defendant solicitor's files were seized. An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention. Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.  1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared. Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties. 2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge. It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs. It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","FIAT. The defendant was in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. The plaintiff had been in contempt since the third party order sought. The trustee was appointed, and the files of Bawolin were seized. The accountant prepared a forensic audit. HELD: The court ordered the defendant to pay solicitor/client costs. 1)This was the more appropriate route in the circumstances.  2)The Court was satisfied that the defendant was not in fact indebted to Bawolin as he now says at the time of the contempt. 3)The court ordered that the solicitor/custodial costs should be taxed."
1997canlii1932.txt,"The plaintiff's leg was impaled for 25 minutes on an iron fence which he had attempted to climb for. He was treated at the emergency department of the Victoria General Hospital for an hour. He did not inform the doctors as to the length of time he had been impaled. Upon his release he was advised to watch for any infection. He was not issued antibiotics. The wound quickly worsened, and the plaintiff was forced to undergo surgery and a skin graft to repair his leg. He sued the doctors who initially treated him for negligence. Dismissing the action, that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way. While the defendants underestimated the nature and extent of the injury, they provided a recognized method of treatment based upon the knowledge they had. The real fault lies with the plaintiff who failed to reveal fully what had happened to him.","The plaintiff alleged negligence by the two defendants medical doctors and claims damages arising from the negligence. HELD: The plaintiff's case was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendants and each of them did not fall below the standard of care required in their treatment of the plaintiff. Further the plaintiff's loss is not attributable to any of the acts of the defendants but rather is the direct result of the injury he suffered. 2)The plaintiff's injuries were not caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way. The treatment of his leg was appropriate and within the type of performance expected of an emergency medicine specialist. 3)The medical doctor had no more information than the plaintiff and, following standard emergency room procedures, with the information of the doctor, with respect to the patient's information, his advices in the case of the wound, as presented, were appropriate and in the type that an emergency physician would normally exercise. 4)The doctor's actions were appropriate. The decision to thoroughly flush out the wound and close it was within the standard prescribed by the emergency medicine physician."
1999canlii1730.txt,"The offender was convicted of robbery. He and four other young men attacked and violently robbed a university student of jewellery and other valuables worth more than $7,000. Despite poor upbringing, abuse at the hands of his stepmother, and being moved from many foster homes, the offender had completed high school and one year of university. There was a favourable pre-sentence report suggesting good prospects for rehabilitation, and a joint sentence recommendation for two years' imprisonment followed by two years probation with strict terms, including 180 hours of community service. Accepting the joint sentence recommendation, that the offender is at a crossroads, and has the talent and motivation to become reintegrated into society as a productive member of the community, and who will benefit from a shorter term of imprisonment than is usual for this type of offence, combined with post incarceration supervision.",The accused was convicted of robbery. He was sentenced to two years in federal penitentiary followed by two years probation. The accused was also given credit for time in remand pending his sentence. The Court found that the accused was at a crossroads. The court found that he had some talent and motivation to become a productive member of society. The sentencing guidelines for sentencing young men do not provide a sentence of two years imprisonment.
1999skqb29.txt,"In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent. The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings. The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","FIAT. The applicants sought an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development, including the subject bylaw, and from further considering an application for a discretionary use permit by Kathy and Gary Palidwar for private hotel development connected with the community facility known as the Evergreen Centre. HELD: The application was granted in part. The court found nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal or the meetings in camera. The applicant had met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. The Court found nothing illegal about the respondent's proceedings in respect to the proposed hotel."
2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The appellants were convicted of unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. The trial judge found that the appellants had aboriginal hunting rights under s. 35(1) of The Constitution Act, 1867 and that they enjoyed an aboriginal right to hunt for food on unoccupied Crown land. The appellants appealed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge correctly identified the test for a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal peoples' right to hunting. It was necessary to apply the test established by Sparrow and expanded in the subsequent authorities. 2)The appellant had aboriginal hunts with artificial lights. They had not infringed their aboriginal right. 3)The limiting legislation did not infringe aboriginal rights. The objective was primarally safety and the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity was not triggered by the legislation. The regulation applied to the appellant as hunters, not as Metis. The appellant was not subject to s11.1 of the Regulations. The issue was whether the limiting legislation was a prima facie infringement on the appellans' aboriginal right and if so, whether it was justifiable. 4)The appellant had not proven that the s.11.2(3)(a) of Saskatchewan Regulations infringed the appellation's aboriginal right of hunt. The evidence did not support the conclusion that the legislation had an avalid objective and that it did not interfere with the appellates' aboriginal rights to hunt. 5)The court found that s.9.1 (3) was not an essential test for determining prima-facie infringement of aboriginal rights and that the test was not applicable to the appellant. The court found the appellas had aboriginal rights under the Constitution Act and that s11(3)) of the regulations did not affect their aboriginal rights, but rather, curtailed their 'Aboriginal rights' and their 'Indianness'. The appellant had failed to demonstrate that the regulation in s. 12 of the Wildlife Act was a reasonable and prudent regulation. The Court found that it was not necessary to attempt to define aboriginal hunting right. The appeal is dismissed. The decision is set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law."
2003skqb550.txt,"The respondent seeks an order prohibiting the petitioner from removing her son from Saskatchewan until she obtains a Court order allowing her to do so. The child is the petitioner's son from a prior relationship. The petitioner plans to have the child live with his biological father in Edmonton so that he can get the specialized medical care that he requires. When the petitioner and the respondent separated, they consented to a judgment, which granted the petitioner custody of the child and gave access rights to the respondent. The consent judgment provided that the petitioner was to provide the respondent with 90 days notice of any proposed change in the child's residence. Notice of the upcoming move was provided to the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. The consent judgment does not require the petitioner to get an order before changing the child's residence. An application will be required by the petitioner to vary the access arrangements with the respondent.","The respondent and the petitioner were married in 1999 and separated in January 2000. The petitioner had two children from two prior relationships. Her daughter, Candace, was now 16 years old and her son, Dylan, was 10 years old. The respondent and his common law wife had recently decided that it would be in the best interests of the child to be with his biological father in Edmonton, where he would have immediate access to medical therapy; consultation with his psychiatrist and advanced modes of therapy including scholastic, which are only available in Swift Current. The mother sought an order prohibiting the petitioner from removing the child from the province until she obtains a Court order allowing her to do so. Application dismissed; nothing in the judgment referred to above requires the petitioner to obtain such an order. It only provides that the respondent receive 90 days' written notice."
2008skqb33.txt,"The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules striking paragraphs of the amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the statement of claim to remain would be an abuse of process. The paragraphs of the amended statement of claim at issue deal with the fact that the plaintiff alleges he was assaulted by the defendant and sustained bodily harm. The defendant was charged with assault, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. The issue is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceedings on the subsequent civil proceedings. HELD: The paragraphs of the statement of claim at issue do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial is inadmissible in a subsequent civil trial as proof that the party did not commit the offence.  2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the Crown against the defendant, the Crown bore the onus throughout to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence did not apply and the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings. In the civil proceeding, the plaintiff is in a position to control the presentation of his case and must prove his case on a balance of probabilities. The onus of proving self-defence is on the defendant. He bears the onus of proving the assault was justified and was made with reasonable force.","The defendants apply for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173 striking paragraphs 10, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 from the defendants' amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the statement of claims to remain would be an abuse of process. HELD: 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal proceeding is inadmissible in a subsequent civil proceeding as proof that the party did not commit the offence. 2) A decision of acquitting in a civil proceeding is an abuse and is therefore an abuse. 3) A conviction of a criminal offence is in admissible in any event of the cause. 4) A sentence of acquittals in a Criminal proceeding is not inadmissible in a future civil proceeding."
2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","The applicant municipality appealed a decision of the Court of Appeal striking the claim on the basis that s. 36 of the Constitution Act represented an agreement among the federal government and the provinces, and that s36 of the Act represented a justiciable commitment for the benefit of the municipality. The court held that s37 represents an actionable commitment for its benefit and that, while this commitment may be actionable at the instance of the provinces and the federal governments, it cannot be considered actionable in the hands of municipalities such as the applicant municipality. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the court found that the applicant's proposed interpretation of s.36 of s36 was not a reasonable cause of action and that the Court would retain jurisdiction to decide whether the claim should be converted to an action."
2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.","The applicant was a long term recipient of income assistance benefits. He applied under Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order in the nature of mandamus compelling the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The Board allowed the appeal and found that the applicant was 'a person in need' as defined in the Employment Support and Income Assistance Act (ESIA). The Board ordered that his assistance was to be effective the date that he was assessed. The respondent did not request an adjournment to examine financial information. The Department of Community Services requested further information. HELD: The application for an Order in the Nature of Mandamus was granted. The Court granted the application for the application. The court found that there was a clear legal right established to have the decision of the Appeal Board enforced. The purpose of the legislation was to set up an Appeal Board whose decisions could be totally ignored. The application was granted on the basis that the respondent had not complied with the decision and should not be required to appeal the decision. The Act was required to be done when the Appeal board released its decision, retroactive to June 2007. The timing of the appeal was required. The applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding; the duty to the applicant arises from the Appeal's decision which binds the Respondent as per the regulations; the regulations also confirm the Respondents have no discretion as to whether the decision is binding generally or as to the time period effected. The decision of an Appeal board is binding on both the applicant and the Minister. The appeal board decision is retroactive. The evidence from the appeal hearing was produced at the appeal hearings. The Applicant had a right to seek further information as he was a person in the context of the decision that was being made. The fact that the appellant refused to comply and the respondent refused to make further requests for information even when the decision was made on eligibility exceeded the income, assets and other resources available to the Applicant. The appellant has a legal Interest in the proceeding and the duty arises from an Appeal's determination which binds as per regulations; and the regulations confirm the respondent has no discretion, either as to when the Decision is binding broadly or as time period. The order of mandamamus is retroactively retroactive from June 2007 to June 2008. The reason given for the delay in the appeal is that the Board was not aware of the applicant's income at the time of the hearing."
2010skpc153.txt,"The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations. The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch. The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one. The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations. The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door. The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts. It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue.",The accused was charged with seven counts related to his conviction under s. 13(1) of the Fisheries Regulations. The accused had a fishing licence issued by Vendor 36640. The RCMP had also executed a search warrant on his vehicle. The Crown argued that the accused had not possessed a fishing license and that the Fisheries Act had prohibited him from applying for or obtaining a licence. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of s. 27 of The Fisheries Act. There were no breaches of s7(1)(j) of The Charter. The Court held that the Crown had conceded that the Minister had no authority to prohibit the accused from applying. The court dismissed the appeal. The issue was whether the Minister of Environment had the authority to revoke the accused's licence and to prohibit him from obtaining a license at the relevant times. The prohibition was not in effect in s27 of the Act.
2011skca19.txt,"The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied to appeal. HELD: The conviction was upheld and the appeal was allowed. 1) The Court reviewed the evidence and found that the accused was not reasonably believed that he was being assaulted. 2) The trial judge did not err in his decision to use pepper spray. He did not address the fact that the officer was armed with a taser and had not indicated that he would use it to deal with a dangerous situation. 3) The court found that even if the accused had been reasonably believed, he would have rejected the defence of self-defence on the basis that the use of pepper spray was not proportionate. 4) The accused's reasons did not reflect an inconsistency. They were all consistent with the trial judge's reasons. The Court found that, in the circumstances, the accused's mistake was reasonable, one that an ordinary person using ordinary care could have made in the same circumstances. The trial Judge did not erred in his reasons. He simply did not direct himself to all of the relevant evidence resulting in reviewable error. The accused did not take any steps such as pulling out his baton to deal a dangerous or threatening situation. The force used by the officer in reacting to the perceived threat was justified. The court reviewed the trial decision and found the accused guilty of assault and a reasonable belief that he reasonably believed he was about to be assaulted. The appeal judge also found that there was a reasonable basis for the accused to believe that the taser was necessary to protect himself against the apprehended danger. The judge also concluded that the trial was not in error."

Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","The primary issue between the parties is custody of their four children. Ancillary to and dependent upon determination of the custody issue, is the quantum of child support that will be payable by either party. Matrimonial property owned by the parties at the time of separation has largely been divided between them to their mutual satisfaction. The primary issue is custody. HELD: The children will reside in the joint custody of the parties and reside an equal amount of time in each home alternating every two weeks. 1) The Court must take into consideration only the best interests of the children as determined by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of those children. 2) The court must take consideration only in the best interest of the child as determined in reference to their needs and needs. 3) The children are to reside in equal amounts with the respondent and with the other parties. The Court will take into account only the interests of each party as determined through reference to condition, mean, needs, and other factors of those parties. 4) The evidence demonstrated that the children are not doing well academically and socially. The court is not persuaded that they be removed from an environment that offers them the stability that they require nor from the specialized educational opportunities available to them in Saskatoon. 5) The child support order must take account only of the best and interests of both parties."

The parties agreed in 1997 that the father should have interim custody. The mother argued that she was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization for unipolar/clinical depression. The father had been employed as a long distance trucker but now worked days in the city. HELD: The applications for custody were dismissed. Overnight access was granted to the mother. 1)The application ignored the consistent law which states the courts should not vary interim custody arrangements whether legal or de facto in the absence of evidence that the child(ren) are in some way at risk, or other compelling reason. It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. The non-primary care parent should proceed to final order which in this provicne means obtaining a pre-trial date for a pre-trial conference and proceed to trial if custody is not resolved at that stage. 2)The court was satisfied on the basis of a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health was stable that the child was not at risk if the mother were granted overnight access.","FIAT.

2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","The respondent was awarded $1,945 for a total of $6,944. The matrimonial home was previously divided equally between the parties. The respondent was to assume half of the proceeds of its sale. The petitioner was to claim exemption for his own house, which they never lived in, and all of the assets which he had before the marriage. HELD: 1)The respondent's home was divided approximately equally between both parties already and direct no further division or appraisal of those properties. 2)An accrual to a pension during the period between the marriage valued at $8,358; (2) an accruals to a Standard Life contract during the same period in the amount of $1200. 3)The matrimonial home was, prior to the 21 month marriage between the two parties, the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children all born of a previous marriage. Five of those children live with the mother. The Court had not considered the precise value of the personal properties because the evidence had was not reliable and there was an appearance of equality as noted above. The court accepted the claim that the matrimony home was exempt property. The wife was to have assumed debts of almost $5,000 of which $2,500 must be credited to him, leaving a credit to the mother of $2 million. The husband was to be given half of his pension during that period valued at the same amount. 3.The Court accepted the counter petition and accepted the $25,000 claim against the matonial home. It was, in its entirety, inequitable and had the court not satisfied that it would be unfair and inequitable to do so having regard only to any extraordinary circumstance; or unfair and unfair to the spouse who has custody of the children."

2_2000skqb111.txt,"The plaintiff claimed damages for failure to perform as agreed in constructing a residence. Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower. The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D & S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence. The defendant failed to perform as agreed and the plaintiff sought damages for extras requested. The plaintiff sought judgment for the sum of $41,007.83.

The court concluded that there was a discussion about round pillars and it was intended that they would be a part of the contract. The money was withheld to ensure rectification of number of deficiencies. The counterclaim was also dismissed. 1)Cost of Performance [28] was the prima facie measure of damages. It was attributable to both parties equally. 2)The addition of extras was clearly an extra ordered by the plaintiff. 3)The defendant did not press on as he might have. He did not ensure that the program of construction was clearly defined and adhered to. 4)The cost of the extras was to be treated as an extra over and above the contract price. 5)Costs of the repairs were attributable to the defendants equally. The Court concluded that the defendant was liable to pay for the work but was not liable to cover the costs of the added extras. 6)Costing out the $4 million in lost sales, the court concluded the defendant should have paid the balance of the extra."
2_2001nssc171.txt,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to clause 15.10 of the lease quashed. The lease contained an arbitration clause which allowed the arbitrators to determine who was responsible for repairs, who was to rectify the lease and to use other canons of construction including estoppel. The tenant sought a stay or similar relief on the ground that the arbitration agreement did not apply to the dispute between the tenant and the landlord. The arbitrator was not limited to interpreting the words of the contract but could deal more broadly with the clauses and provisions of the leased premises. This was an area where the arbitration clause was not covered by insurance. The dispute also involved insurance coverage and whether insurance should have covered the damage. The court concluded that the arbiter was incorrect in assuming jurisdiction to apply the principle of estoppelle against the tenants. The Court concluded that a limited arbitration clause is not appropriate in this case. The arbitration clause under the lease is a limited one and the Court concluded the arbitrations were not properly interpreted. The decision of the arbitration clause in the lease was a limited and patently unreasonable. The fact that the court reviewed the case and found that the Arbitrator was entitled to award damages was beyond the scope of the Arbitration clause because it was not dispute about the clauses or provisions of a lease. The issue was whether the arbitrated arbitrator correctly assumed jurisdiction and gave procedural fairness. The issues of responsibility for repairs and whether the loss was covered by an insurance and whether notification by the Tenant required or did a claim need to be made were issues within the jurisdiction of the court. The standard of review was correctness with respect to the issue of jurisdiction. The Arbitrator's decision was not patently wrong. The principles of waiver and estoppela applied to the arbiters. The award of damages was limited to the interpretation of clauses and provision of the leases. The judge did not err in concluding that the award was to be awarded by arbitration, but only those disputes involving the clauses of the clause. The appeal court concluded the Court was incorrect. The trial court concluded: 1) the arbitrative arbitrator is not limited simply to interpreting and interpreting the word of the document but could also deal more with the conduct of the parties and the effect of that conduct. The principle of arbitration is a canon of construction which the arbitrails are not limited by. The test for review of an arbitrator's jurisdiction is the same that for statutory tribunal, namely: is the award patently unreasonably"

The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation. Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'. There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties.","The applicant brought an application pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 14.25 to strike out the applicant's application to strike it. The applicant sought a variation in relation to spousal support and a retroactive child support order, both designed to cover the applicant’s past educational costs. The application sought a retroactively child support application. The court found that the applicant had complied with his child support obligation as set out in the corollary relief judgment and there was nothing to enforce. The only issue was whether the additional loan payments were known or anticipated at the time of the corolla relief judgment. The second aspect of the application sought to strike the applicant for retroactive support. The Court found that although the applicant was responsible for the repayment of the loans, the applicant did not take the deduction as contemplated in their agreement and there is no evidence the applicant declared it as income. The first aspect of application sought was a retroactivity child support. Application to strike this application was dismissed. The applicants had not complied with their child support obligations as set in the Corollary Relief judgment and the Court found there was no basis to enforce the corolary relief.

By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action. In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs. Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609.","FIAT.

The plaintiff was entitled to access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action, including preparation of a statement as to documents and following the modified discovery process set out in my earlier fiat. 2) The questions raised were whether there was any right of privilege as between 609 and Henry; if so, how is it claimed and are such documents privileged as between the plaintiff and Defendants? Who is responsible for the cost of production of documents? 3) The court ordered the disclosure of all documents, including the relevant materials, records, employees and the modified process set forth in my previous fiat. 4) The Court ordered the issuance of an order as to costs."

The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent, a resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and was sentenced to nine months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck used to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and deliver them. The truck was ordered forfeited. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part. 1)The truck was not 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. 2)The sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range but there was no basis for interfering with the sentence imposed. 3)The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the Act. Upon conviction, the first step he ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offences-related' within the meaning of the Act and whether it was proportionate to the nature and gravity of the offence, the circumstances surrounding the commission, the criminal record of the person charged or convicted of the act and whether the member was innocent of any complicity in the offence or collusion in relation to the offence. 4)The defendant was found to have in his vehicle a truck used by him to bring drugs into the Saskatchewan market and deliver the drugs. The sentence imposed at the low end was at a very low level in that the truck was used to transport him to various places across the country. The Crown put street value on the drugs of between $2000 and $3000, with the respondent valuing the drugs at slightly under $2000. The defendant was convicted and sentenced to 9 months with 10 year firearm prohibition. 5)The Court was all of the view the sentence was at very low levels in that this truck was 'used in connection' with the trafficking of drugs. It was clear the truck is used in the commission and delivery of the drugs and there was a significant issue with the refusal of the sentencing judge to order the forfeiture of it. The Court was of the opinion that the impact of an order of forfeiture made under s. 17(2)(a) would be disproportionate to the gravity of offence, and the circumstances around the commission. He found the truck to be commercial one, albeit of small-time nature. He noted the respondent was depressed and remorseful. 6)The court was all in agreement that the sentence should be increased to the level of the sentence.

The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The respondent Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal appealed the Workers' compensation Appeals Tribunal decision. The appeal court held that the Workers’ Compensation Appeals tribunal was wrong to exclude from compensation certain types of workplace events and stressors from an objective point of view. The court also held that there were no stressors on which the claimant’s claim for gradual onset stress could be based. The policy set out four conditions which must be met. The first requirement was that the worker’S subjective reaction to external stressors in the workplace was not relevant to determining if he suffered a compensable accident under s. 4(1) of the GECA; and the second requirement was rejection and failing to give adequate weight to the opinion of the worker's treating psychologist in the absence of evidence to rebut that opinion. The third requirement was the same as in the previous two decisions. The Court reviewed the state of the law at the Tribunal level and found that the Policy was the correct one. The Appeal Court held that, in deciding the claimant for gradual start stress, the Policy set out the conditions under which each type of stress is compensable under the GCA; and that the policy was declaratory of the better view of the Law that applies to all stress claims under GECA. The decision of the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal in Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick was also reviewed for correctness. The appellant’ s claim for mild onset stress was dismissed. The only issue left to be resolved was whether the Policy’d be the correct approach to the workplace stressors. The Policy set forth the conditions for each type to be considered. The second requirement is that the stressors be examined objectively in the sense required under the Policy. This requires an objective approach to assessing the nature of the workplace events. WCAT did not err in finding that the workers’ subjective reaction was not sufficient to determine if they suffered a compensationable accident. The fact that the claimant had been off work for more than 6 months was irrelevant. The evidence showed that the workplace event or stressors experienced by the claimant were not unusual and excessive in comparison to those experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation. The claimant”s claim was dismissed on the grounds that the policies did not change the nature and purpose of the legislation. The issue was whether there was an objective or subjective approach to this aspect of the claimant. The policies set out certain work-related events that are non-compensable.

The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","The Landlord and Tenant appealed an order allowing the Landlord $787.50 as compensation for what the Director found to be a breach of the statutory condition to provide a premises suitable for habitation. The Director found that the Landlords allowed mouldy conditions in her home and failed to rectify the same. She allowed $712.50 for the furniture and $75.00 for the rug and clothing. The Landlord did not attend the hearing before the Director and appealed. HELD: The Landlords' evidence was rejected entirely. The Court found on a strong balance of probabilities that there was mould and the conditions that allowed mould to develop. The damages were a little higher at $862.50. The court found on the same basis that the Director's discounting of the value of the rug, clothing and furniture went a little too far. The damage claims were assessed a little more at $1,200. The $1 million damages claim was reduced to $500. The amount of the damages awarded was revised to $863.50 and the Court awarded the damages a little lower."
2_2009nspc21.txt,"The defendant farmer pled guilty to failing to take every precaution that was reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons in the workplace, after a young employee drowned in a manure pit that was not properly secured due to a damaged barricade having been removed while a new one was on order. Defendant sentenced to fine of $25,000, from which the sum of $15,000 shall be paid to the Canadian Farmers' Disability Registry; defendant ordered to perform 160 hours of community service with respect to farm safety. The defendant was an individual and not a huge corporation, had been conscientious about safety issues prior to this incident and had endeavored to improve safety at his farm after the incident; the deceased had also failed in his responsibilities under the Act and was working with a significant blood alcohol content.","The defendant farmer owned and operated a family dairy farm. He was 38 years old and supports two children. In 2006, one of his employees, a young dairy farmer, died in an accident at his farm. The defendant pleaded guilty to an offence under the Occupational Health and Safety Act for failing to take every precaution that is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons at the workplace. The farmer's guilty plea relates to the fact that on August 13, 2006, there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. The farm was inherently dangerous and farm work being inherently dangerous, accidents are daily risk. The farming community was at risk. He had made substantial changes to the farm since the tragedy. He undertook a number of safety initiatives to improve safety at the farm. His failure to take reasonable precautions to address the damaged barricade had been removed at the entrance of the manure pit. The farmers were in no condition to operate equipment, which they needed to remove manure to the manure hole. The failure to secure the manure paddy pit and arrange for an alternative to use the pit did not meet the farmer's responsibility to farm safety. The Court accepted the $25,000 penalty as a significant penalty and accepted the submission that a $25k penalty is a significant amount. The penalty should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances but this case does not lend itself easily to comparisons. The court found that the farmer was not a large corporation and had responsibilities under the Health and safety Act that he did not comply with. The Farm Safety Act requires that every employee, while at work, shall take every reasonable precaution in the circumstance to protect the employee's own health and health and to protect their own health at or near the workplace and the farmer is not an individual. The guilty plea was not proportionate to his moral blameworthiness for the offence of failing to prevent the damage to the barricade having been removed. The fact that the farm was not 40 hour weeks and the farmers were not taking conventional 40 hour week weeks, obviously 160 hours is four weeks and that is how many weeks he would have to work. The judge found that farmer's failure to act in accordance with the farm safety principles was not an appropriate penalty. The jury recommended that the $5,000 be paid as a proportionate sum to the farmer’s responsibility to improve the farm and to provide an alternative alternative to using the pit."

During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence. HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered. The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter. The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted as a full exhibit and became part of the Crown's case. The Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt in all respects.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondent on the charge of impaired driving on the basis that two breath samples were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the Crown sought to overturn the acquittals on the impaired driving charge. 1)The trial judge failed to consider the contradictory evidence available to the police officer in forming the objective grounds for the demand sufficient to require additional objective information, such as if the officer had been trained in the use of breathalyzer techniques. 2)The officer was entitled to consider other objective information such as the presence of alcohol on his breath and his willingness to cooperate. The officer was not required to look at the breathalyzers. 3)The accused was not impaired by alcohol. The breathalycer was obtained in the course of a routine exercise. The accused was found to have had a moderate to severe alcohol consumption. 4)The Court was not satisfied that the officer's objective grounds were met. The Court was satisfied that there was no reasonable basis for the officer to demand a breath sample. The court was satisfied the officer was capable of forming reasonable grounds for a demand."

The mother was the successful party and income was imputed by the court to the respondent.  Held, costs in the amount of $3,000 are awarded against the father. The father's position caused unnecessary time, effort and delay. The court referenced L. (N.D.) v. L. (M.S.) (2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77. Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs.","The court awarded costs of $3,000 to the respondent on the issue of custody and access rights. The parties litigated the apportionment of custody, access rights and the quantification of child support and special expenses for their two children. The respondent sought an award of costs valued at $3000 based on an application of Scale of Tariff 'A' of the Costs and Fees Act, supra. The tariff is reproduced following Rule 77.18. The court awarded the respondent $3.5 million based on the tariff. The amount involved was within the range of $40,000 ‑$65,000. The appellant was the successful party on the important parenting issue. The evidence established that the respondent was the appropriate primary care parent. The Court reviewed the costs of the application of the tariffs and found that the tariff was the governing tariff for the purpose of determining an appropriate costs award. The costs awarded were in the range $3 to $5,000 and were subject to significant financial hardship."

3_1999skqb140.txt,"An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","This is an action by Redhead Equipment against Standard Transportation Services and Hyndman Transport (1972) Limited with respect to amounts owing for payments on vehicles leased by Redheads and for parts and labour supplied by Redback to these leased vehicles. The defendant, Hyndmans, has been noted for default. HELD: The action is dismissed. 1)The facts do not satisfy me on a balance of probabilities that this is an appropriate circumstance for an award in favour of the plaintiff based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.  2)The plaintiff's claim with respect the unpaid repairs against the defendant has not been proven and that portion of the claim is dismissed as not being proven. 3)The defendant has never been held responsible for any breach of the lease. The evidence does not establish that Hynds had notice of the invoices, or that there was a purchase order number obtained from Hyndmann authorizing repairs. The plaintiff's evidence does, however, not establish Hynd's obligation to make the lease payments on behalf of the defendant and that there is a purchase ordering number obtained by Hyndm. 4)The evidence of the parties is clear that Hystman did make some payments on the plaintiff, Redhead, either in contract or equity for the lease payment on the vehicles and for the repairs to them. Although there may not be strict legal obligation by the defendant to pay monies, it would be unjust not to make an award. 5)The plaintiffs claim with regard to the unpaid repair against the plaintiff has not proven and the portion of claim is also dismissed. The facts do satisfy me that this was an appropriate case for an awards in favour the plaintiff.  6)The issues are for how long were the lease to continue and on what conditions? The plaintiff’s claim with the claim with regards to the paid repairs against Hyndmen has not yet been proven. The plaintiffs’ evidence does vary on this issue. The court did not establish the defendant had notice or that it was a purchaser of the vehicles. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement.

3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of the plaintiff's cattle getting into the plaintiff’s canola field in late July 1999. The plaintiff admitted that his cattle were in the plaintiff canola crop on one occasion but said that there was no evidence that his cows were in it on any other occasion. The defendant denied any liability under s.27 of the Stray Animals Act and denied any negligence in looking after his cattle. HELD: Judgment was granted in favour of the plaintiffs and together with pre-judgment interest from January 2000 and costs. The court found that the cattle owner was strictly liable for crop damages caused by his cattle and that other cattle were not in the field. The Court found that s.28 of the Act was only an Act of God or some similar involuntary cause which might be sufficient to found a cattle-trespass defence. The law in Saskatchewan is clear that cattle owner is liable for such loss as is caused by the entry of his cattle onto the crop of another. The damages sustained by the plaintiffs were as follows: 1)The plaintiff”s cattle were found to have caused crop damage to the plaintiff. 2)The damage was minimal. The damage was minor. The plaintiffs” cattle were out of the canola for more than one occasion and were not found to be in the crop. 3)The court found the plaintiff was strictly responsible for crop loss. The fact remains that the plaintiff cattle were never in the canolas field on more than a occasion and that there were other cattle not in it.

HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired. The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients. 3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice. 4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants. The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods. 5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","The applicant sought interlocutory injunctive relief framed in argument. The applicant sought an interlocututory injunction until trial and to enforce certain restrictive covenants, obligations of confidentiality and fiduciary duty binding on the respondents. HELD: The injunctions were granted on a quia timet basis and to ensure that the respondents were in breach of any right which accrued to the applicant. The injunctions were to enforce the restrictive covenant, restrain employees from competitive activity pending the expiration of reasonable notice periods and generally restrain all respondents from any direct or indirect dealings with customers of Danka or pertaining to equipment sold or leased to customers by Danka. The court found that the injunctions did not violate the applicant's right to a fair trial. The application was dismissed. The Court found that Danka failed to demonstrate a prima facie case or even a serious issue to be tried that it was in law entitled to more than two weeks notice or that the respondent employees were in violation of any rights which accrued the applicant to Danka and that the applicants were in a breach of the injunty rights."

Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge erred in ruling the respondents had sufficient interest to qualify as applicants for custody. The court's role is not to determine broad social issues but instead, to determine what custodial arrangement is in the child's best interest. This rule prevails even in contests between a natural parent and a stranger. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with costs here and below and the matter returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access. 1)The trial judge's error as to the categorization of the appellant as needing level care when in fact the level is funding level and not 'care' level is not material as there exists other strong evidence, including that of the court appointed psychologist as to concerns about the mother's ability to care for the child and the risk to the child if he is left unsupervised for extended periods of time in the mother care. The trial judge considered the testimony of the respondent's expert psychologist, who did not interview the parties, and simply accepted the evidence of the other psychologists in making his determination as was the trial's prerogative. 2)The court's duty is not only to determine a natural and natural parent/child relationship but also to determine who's care will be advanced. This principle prevails in contests with a natural or stranger parent and is taken into account by the judge when considering the factors outlined in clause (i) of s.8. The Court's role in deciding what custodian arrangement is best interest prevails only in contests where a natural person and a relative are without status to make an application for custody or where a parent and stranger parent are without a status to apply for custody together."

The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions. The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue.

The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication. Allowing the mother's application, that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say. Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues. As the parties lacked flexibility, a detailed access plan was incorporated.","The parties separated in June 1992 and the parties voluntarily left the matrimonial home in November 1992. They have two children, Conor and Braden. The parties have been married for eight and half years. The Matrimonial Property Act requires joint custody of the children.

4_1996canlii6841.txt,"The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax. Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications. The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately. The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.","Husky Oil appealed a decision of the Revenue and Financial Services Board which upheld the assessment of sales tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of Board reversed. 1)The Board determined that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use in Saskatchewan and there was evidence before the Board upon which it was open to them to come to that conclusion. 2)The assessment pertains to charges incurred by the Appellant in contract with Valtek Controls Ltd. of Alberta. The purchase of the drawings was an independent transaction and was exempt from tax by virtue of s. 8(1)(f) of the Act. The purpose for which the documentation would constitute 'technical papers' is to be consistent with the purposes for which book, literary or technical papers or loose leaf sheets were published. The words used are simple and ordinary. The documents were not supplied with or included in the price of valves as supplied by Valtek but were provided for in response to the Appelleant's specific request to meet its particular requirements. 3)The board determined that, in New Brunswick, the documentation is not required to prepare the valves in Saskatchewan. The issue before the board was whether the word 'published' restricts the words which precede it and requires an element of distribution or availability to the public. The alternative does not focus upon the extent to which the document is produced, distributed or made available to a sufficiently broad audience but rather the purpose for the purposes of which it is intended to be made available. The definition adopted by the Board is a question of law reviewable by this Court. 4)The appeal was permitted and the Board reversed on appeal."

4_1998canlii13643.txt,"The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act. The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the adjudicator's decision to award its employee $1,500 in lieu of proper notice.

The appellant appealed the adjudication's decision, arguing that the adjudicating officer exceeded his jurisdiction in determining what the terms of the employee's employment contract were and that Cajon had not breached its obligations. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator acted well within his jurisdiction when determining what terms of Ms. Kovach's employment agreement were and had not broken the contract. 2)The Court did not find sufficient evidence to show that the employer had frustrated or broken the employee. 3)The court found that there was insufficient evidence to establish that the applicant had not been frustrated or violated her employment obligation.

The plaintiff managed post-secondary programs with an annual budget of $960,000, taught upgrading and university entrance courses, and supervised other teaching and support staff. In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs. There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict. The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct. The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal. The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause. HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed. The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct. There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance. The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract. Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed. Although the plaintiff had been treated unfairly, the plaintiff had not shown that the employer was guilty of harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious conduct.",HELD: The plaintiff was dismissed from his employment.

4_2000canlii2523.txt,"The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval. In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","The applicant land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval. The applicant applied for tentative subdivision approval in 1997 and received the same in 1998. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. The development officer declared the application incomplete and declared it to be in fact complete. The application for final subdivision approved was declared incomplete. The developer appealed the decision of the development officer declaring the application to be incomplete. HELD: The application was dismissed. The decision of council or the development director, as the case may be, does not reasonably carry out the intent of the municipal planning strategy or conflicts with the provisions of the land-use by-laws or the subdivision bylaw. The Municipality has a different interpretation of mandamus to be granted. The only remedy for the applicant is to declare the application complete. 1)The Municipality relies upon s. 278 of the Municipal Government Act in its submission that the higher road standard represented a major obstacle for the Applicant. The municipality relies on s. 277(1)(b) noting specifically that the application was incomplete. It was therefore technically not refusal. 2)The applicant is entitled to a declaration that the applicant application is complete. 3)The application for a final subdivision is granted within two years of the date of the approval of the tentative plan. 4)The municipality has a new interpretation of the mandamus. The Minister of Finance has a special duty to ensure that the proposed subdivision meets the requirements of the subdivision and the Minister's Office has a unique interpretation of s. 283 of the MGR Act. The Municipal Government act provides that a person can appeal a refusal to approve a concept plan or a tentative plan of subdivision on the grounds that the decision is not comply with the subdivision s. 250(3). The Minister's office has a very different interpretation. 5)The Minister's duty to protect developers exactly like the Applicant who received tentative approval under one regime and are to be protected from any subsequent changes. The fact that the municipality relies upon the Municipal Act s.278 represents the legislator's effort to protect developer exactly like them who received a tentative approval in one regime is not enough to deny mandamus in the plan. The Applicant is entitled only to a declared declaration that it is complete, (again subject to non-contentious error in the Plan). 6)The requirements for mandamus are exacting.

The Crown and the defence put forward a joint sentencing recommendation of two years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount of the fraud, which was all that the appellants had actually retained. The sentencing judge ordered full restitution. The appellants appealed; the Crown conceded that the appeal should be allowed. Allowing the appeal, that while the agreement reached by the Crown and the appellants was not binding upon the sentencing judge, the joint recommendation was a fit sentence; in the circumstances there was no sound reason for departing from it.","The appellants pleaded guilty to fraud over $5000 and were sentenced by the Crown to two (2) years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount of the fraud. The Crown and defence advanced a joint sentencing recommendation for two (1) years of probation and a restitution order for restitution of the full amount of overpayment. The appellants applied for leave and, if granted, appeal the judge's decision to order restitution of half of the total amount of fraud. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed. The court also granted leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. The Court also granted the leave to review the decision and allowed leave to allow the appeal to proceed. The parties were advised that the judge had accepted the joint recommendation for probation and the restitution order was a fit sentence. While the agreement reached between counsel was of course, not binding on the judge, the joint recommended made to him was a fitting sentence.

4_2005nspc10.txt,"The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and cocaine for the purposes of trafficking both under s. 5(2) and with possession with the proceeds obtained by crime under s355(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused had a knapsack with him and a backpack with him. The police officers seized the backpack and at subsequent search at the police station it was found to contain: an unopened bottle of Olands Export Ale, 232 grams of cannabis marihuana, 63 grams of cocaine, bundles of cash containing $3000 in total, a digital scale and a black wallet. The knapsacks were found in the passenger area of the vehicle and the cash was rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash. The cash was found in a backpack and the defendant had a large amount of cash in it. The evidence established that the knapsocks were for the use of trafficking, both under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and with the possession of property obtained by the crime under the 355(b). The Crown did not call evidence but argued that the circumstances leading to an inference of possession vary so widely, each case turns on its own facts and other cases are useful for illustrative purposes at best. The Crown continued its case by calling two further witnesses. HELD: The accused was guilty of all three charges. 1) The evidence was admissible against the accused. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from all of the evidence before the court is not only that the accused was in possession of the knappedack but that, because it contained items of such a personal nature, because the cocaine the defendant handed to Hyslop came from the knapack and because no one else had access to the knappingack, the defendant must have had knowledge of all of its contents and consented to their being there. The second reasonable inference was that the cash had been seized and the knappersack was used to hold the cash. 2) The only inference to the court was not only the knappingsack was in the personal possession of him but that the marijuana and cocaine found in his knapsock came from that knapsak and because the defendant gave it to Hoseslop, the knapper was used as a weapon to hold their proceeds of sale. 3) The Crown was satisfied that the only reasonable conclusion to be drew from all the evidence was not that the defendant was in personal possession but that he had knowledge and control of the bag and its contents until he left"

The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars.

The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government sought an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and in default of so doing striking the offending portions of the statement of claim.

4_2006skca76.txt,"The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","The father granted interim custody of a 10 year old girl to his father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation, the father paid some maintenance for the child and had extensive access to the child, she spending most of the time with her maternal grandparents. He alleged that the mother was an alcoholic and that her alcoholism adversely affected the child. The father appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. The Court found that the hearsay evidence in affidavits in applications for interim relief was not admissible, given the direct denial under oath by the mother of either alcoholism or lack of proper care for the children, there should have been an order directing trial of an issue rather than a decision made on the written evidence filed.

4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine. The plaintiff also claims damages for breach against the defendants for breach for breach in an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. HELD: The claim against the plaintiff is dismissed. The only remaining issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by plaintiff. The trial judge erred in characterizing the plaintiff's actions as mere preparation. The defendant competed with her employer for business which had been the employer's; her placing of the bid went beyond preparation. Although the plaintiff had telephoned the union hall and was told there were no members available for him to hire, the defendant did not prove that the plaintiff used any confidential information or trade secrets. The claim is dismissed with costs against the employer and $500.00 for the defendant. The court found that the defendant breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. Hearsay: The trial court held that the trial judge was not entitled to costs against either party. The Court held that there was no case law on point in this province and the plaintiff breached his fiduciary duty. The judge held that an employee is under an implied obligation not to compete with an employer during the term of his or her employment. The fact that the applicant had telemed the union halls and was informed there were electricians available for the same job was not a breach of the duty."
4_2009skqb403.txt,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","HELD: The court granted interim relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, and The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The court ordered the respondent to pay $1,500 per month. The Court found that the respondent had established a prima facie case that the petitioner stood in loco parentis to the children and that she was a “spouse” by virtue of the definition in the Act. The respondent was to pay spousal support of $1.500 per monthly basis. The issue of the respondent’ s.5(1) of the Family Maintenance Act was also raised. The applicant’d been living with the respondent for some time and claimed that she had always been a ‘spouse.’ The respondent”s application for sole custody was dismissed. The issues were resolved in the chambers hearing and the court ordered that the applicant pay $2,349 per month for eight months. The application for interim custody was also dismissed."
4_2010skqb193.txt,"The litigation revolved around a claim by the plaintiffs for damages that resulted from a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006. In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery. HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence. Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery. In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery. The plaintiff was granted 40 days from the date of the order to reply to the demand for particulars.","FIAT: The plaintiffs were operating a tractor unit bearing Manitoba licence plates and pulling semi-trailer bearing an Alberta licence plate. The plaintiffs, presumably husband and wife, were residents of the Province of Alberta. The tractor was owned by an Alberta company and the plaintiffs, at all material times, were, at the time, residents of Alberta, at times, residents in the Province. The collision occurred when the plaintiffs were travelling eastward, whilst the plaintiffs' vehicle was travelling westward. The plaintiff sustained a right leg injury, lacerations, back injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. The defendants were awarded costs. HELD: The defendants' applications are granted. 1) Rule 164 has a different, but similar, scope. Rule 164 enables a party, after delivery of the initial pleadings of the opponent, to demand better particulars and disclosure of documents. 2) Rule 163 enables a third party, before delivery of initial pleaders of the opposition, to seek better particulars, disclosure of which particulars are to be sought. 3) Rule 166 has a similar but similar scope. Unlike Rule 139, which has as its main purpose the provision of sufficient particulars to enable a defendant to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiffs’ claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence, Rule 164 allows a party after delivery to the opponent to demand more particulars and disclose of documents; Rule 164 enabling a party to demand a party that has the resources to prepare for discovery. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to this information, at a minimum, before discovery."
5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issue of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The issue of access was to be mutually agreed upon between the respondent and the child. The court ordered the addition of $24,000 to the value of the matrimonial property as the net increase in equity in the six quarters. The Court ordered the payment of $1,200 to the petitioner for the purposes of the Guidelines. The petitioner was to pay one-half of the $2,200 rent on the farm and one-third of the cost of the vehicle. The father of the child was to provide one-quarter of the farm equipment and was to contribute one-fourth of the costs of the tractor. The respondent was to supply one-fifth of the equipment and the petitioner was awarded the other half of the machinery. The judge concluded that the respondent's costs exceeded the value in the 6 quarters and the court ordered $24000 to be added to the matrionial property. The balance of $97,575 was to the respondent, less one-thhalf the costs. The judgment shall be a charge on the respondent\'s personal land."
5_2002skqb378.txt,"All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old. The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.","The mother was ordered to pay ongoing child support of $1,500 per month. The father was ordered pay ongoing support of approximately $2,497 per month, including s.7 expenses. The mother was to pay costs of $293 per month retroactive to August of 2000. The court found that the mother's income for child support purposes was $35,269.44 and that ongoing support should be fixed at $293. The son's income was $14,971.44. The Court ordered that the son pay $302 per month for the son's music program expenses. Retroactive support was ordered at $1.500. The child's mother was not prepared to allow any retroactive s. 7 expenses."

5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.","The Students' Union and the Students'' Union appealed the Chambers judge's order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The parties argued that the Chambers Judge erred in his approach to the application. HELD: The appeals were dismissed with costs. The court found that the chambers judge had not properly applied the case law dealing with controverted elections and focused on whether the alleged irregularities in the referendum process substantially affected the results of the vote. The Chambers judge did not err in his application. The issues were not the only ones that arose in relation to the referendum. The Federation and the students' union also argued that it was not enough for the Chambers to grant relief because the respondent had no standing to bring his application and that the university had not followed the broad rules of natural justice. The Court concluded that the appeals must be dismissed. The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the students about the referendum and simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. The fact that the students’ Union was a pro-federation organization and a leading voice against joining the Federation was irrelevant. The Chamber judge erred when he concluded that there was no evidence he represented a meaningful portion of the current student body. The students‘ Union argued that, in light of the Chambers decision, the Chambers court erred because the Chambers judges had not taken the proper approach to s. 225 of the Act. The chambers judge concluded that, while the Chambers Court judge erased the Chambers’s decision, he did not have standing to initiate the application pursuant to s225 of the act. The appeals of the Federation and The Students’ union were dismissed."
5_2011nssc53.txt,"A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate. In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister. The parties will bear their own costs. There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded. As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here. The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid. The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation? In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","The father sought party and party costs against his son. The mother's will supported an implied promise against revocation, which the father breached by making a will in favour of his sister after his mother died. The father sought costs of $38,750 on the basic scale if the value of the condominium is used as the 'amount involved' and $26,750 if one-half value, the amount originally at issue, is used. The son sought party costs. The court found that the wills were not mutual and that no agreement against revocation could be implied. The issue was whether the father was required to stand by his 1999 will, including the gift of the condo to his son, which he claimed was a sham and that he should be paid nothing. The central issue in the father's application was not about the meaning of his mother's Will but about the failure of his father to provide an accounting. The family member clearly made a gift to him that failed. The Court ordered the parties' costs to be paid out of the estate."

6_1999skqb18.txt,"An application to strike out the third party claim as not disclosing a reasonable cause of action. The plaintiffs brought a claim in contract and tort alleging Hagblom caused a fire in their building. The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation. The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence. In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. Leave was granted nunc pro tunc to bring third party proceedings. (1)The third party claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action. It was not plain and obvious the claim could not succeed. It was arguable on the pleadings that the third parties did not act in good faith in that it was alleged they deliberately set out to suppress information and destroy evidence. (2)The statutory limitations will not nullify the third party claim if the allegations relevant to the contention that the third parties did not act in good faith are proven.","This is an application by the City of Saskatoon and William Hewitt (the third parties) to strike out the third party claim on the basis that it does not disclose a reasonable cause of action. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The provisions of s. 136.1(2) of The Urban Municipality Act and s. 34 of The Fire Prevention Act prevent the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties in this case and, if so, should the entire third party's claim be struck out pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(a)? 2) The only documents to be considered on an application under Rule 173 are the notice of motion, the statement of claim, the particulars furnished pursuant to demand, and any document referred to in the statement. The Court must assume that every allegation of fact in the claim is true, even if it appears to be very unlikely that will be difficult to prove. 3) The Court cannot consider the statement or defence on an applications to bring third party proceedings, as required by s. 7 of The Contributory Negligence Act. The provisions in s. 66 of The Municipal Municipality act, 1984 prevent the defendant from taking any proceedings against them in this instance. 4) The court must not embark on a determination as to whether the defendants did what they did with reasonable care or omitted to do what was to be done in good faith. The amendments are not relevant to the case at bar. 5) As the third Parties have not established that it is plain and obvious that the impugned claim cannot succeed, the application is dismissed. As to s.7 of The Contory Neglect Act, the Court must exercise its jurisdiction to strike on this ground only in plain and simple cases and where the court is satisfied that the case is beyond doubt.

6_2002nsca46.txt,"The plaintiff appealed an interlocutory decision in which the chambers judge held that a non-party medical doctor who had provided emergency treatment to the plaintiff did not have to answer certain interrogatories on the basis that they required an opinion. The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial. Appeal allowed in part; the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given. Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided. However, opinions typically asked of an expert witness with respect to the medical services provided by the respondent that were not formed as part of his diagnosis and treatment of the appellant are not required to be provided.

The trial judge found that the appellant was not required to answer all interrogatories that required his opinion, including his opinion as to what went wrong in the first operation and why it was necessary for him to do second corrective surgery. The appeal was allowed in part as a result of the appeal. The chambers judge considered this issue of opinion and concluded that he erred by overstating the basis upon which a non-party witness may object to answering an interrogatory calling for an opinion, when he stated that the physician cannot be compelled to provide opinion evidence simply because he was a subsequently treating physician to the applicant. The Court reviewed the relevant rules governing the presentation of expert opinions and found that there was no rule governing the presentations of expert opinion. The court found that in the event the appellant serves further interrogatories or requests discovery of Dr.Miller, the appellant will pay the costs associated with the appeal and the appeal is allowed in full as well."

6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","The court found that the respondent did not stand in the place of a parent when the parties' separation occurred. The respondent was the biological child of the respondent and the respondent was an adult. The court also found that although the respondent had not always been the parent, he had always been a child of both parties and was the natural parent. The child had a relationship with both the respondent's and the petitioner's extended family and the court concluded that the child had always had a parent's role in the marriage.

6_2014skpc40.txt,"Criminal Law – Recognizance The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.",The accused was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance. The Crown now applies for third recognizances. The accused is a repeat sexual offender. He is a high risk to re-offend sexually and is required to complete high intensity sex offender programming. HELD: The accused was remanded to November 12. The Court reviewed the evidence filed by the accused and found that the accused had reasonable grounds to believe that he will commit either a serious personal injury offence or sexual assault. The evidence from the accused was not supported by the evidence from his own personal experience. The court found that there was no evidence that the evidence presented by the RCMP was biased in the assessment of a high-risk offender. The only evidence that it was biased was that the officer had a subjective and objective fear that he would commit a serious sexual assault or sexual offence. The officer had the required subjective and subjective fear and apprehension that he was committing a serious violent or sexual offense. The information from the RCMP officer was not reliable. The judge did not grant the accused a recognizant.
6_2015skqb138.txt,"Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","FIAT: The applicant seeks an order directing a trial to prove the 2013 will in solemn form. The grounds asserted by the applicant are that the defendant did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing and that he was being 'disturbed' by the death of his five daughters. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The Court was satisfied that the applicant has not made out a genuine issue for trial to show the will in a solemn form; 2) it is necessary only to satisfy the court that there is a genuine issues to be tried with respect to the grounds on which the challenge is based, such as lack of testamentary capability or the presence of undue influence. The Court found that the threshold for the challenge was reasonably low. The court found that it is not necessary for challengers of will to present evidence that will convince the court as to the merits of their case; rather, it is a necessary only for satisfy the Court that there a genuine Issue to be attempted with respect the grounds for which the challenged is based. The application must be dismissed.  3) The court was satisfied the applicant had not made an issue for a trial."
7_1990canlii4117.txt,"Where the petitioner demonstrated that she did not upgrade her education during the marriage as a result of her attempts to become pregnant and thus there was a causal connection between the petitioner's need and the marriage, interim maintenance in the amount of $100 per month was ordered ,  having regard to the means, needs and circumstances of each spouse.","The parties were married fifteen years. The petitioner claimed that during the marriage, she spent a lot of time under medical care in an effort to become pregnant. At the time of separation she suffered a miscarriage. She now wishes to enroll in a Certified General Accounting course. HELD: The Court awarded the petitioner $500 per month interim maintenance. The Court found there was some causal relationship between the petitioner's attempts to become a pregnant and the fact that she did not upgrade her education during themarriage. The court awarded the sum of $100 per month. The parties were divorced in 1989. The respondent had been employed by Public Works Canada. His annual salary is $36,817. He worked considerable overtime in 1989 which brought his income up to $48,000. The wife wished to enroll into a Certified Accounting course and was looking to replace a motor vehicle. She claims that she received $17,683 as her share of an equal division upon the sale of the matrimonial home and is too costly to repair. She is looking to buy a new car. The husband is seeking to upgrade his education. The petitioner is seeking $500. The award of $500 is inappropriate. To move matters along towards the goal of financial independence and considering the means, and needs, and circumstances of each spouse, acknowledging that this may not be the basis for a lump sum or monthly periodic maintenance being made at the time the divorce is heard, I find there is some causal connection between the respondent's attempts and the facts. HOLD: The petitioner is entitled to monthly maintenance until this matter is resolved. The amount awarded is inappropriate to award until this issue is resolved and the court could well take that into account if on the hearing of the hearing it is determined that the respondent is determined to be entitled to periodic maintenance for a period of time."
7_1995canlii4030.txt,"After a series of pre-trial conferences, and the exchange of some correspondence between the parties lawyers, the husband took the position that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of his pension. The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order that determined that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the respondent's pension plan during negotiations during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with brief written reasons to follow. 1)The court found that the respondent and the appellant had reached an agreement as of the date of the pre- trial date regarding the value and value of his pension. 2)The Court found that there was no contract that the appellant could enforce. 3)The intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or instalment basis must be clear. 4)The fiat contained the direction that if the petitioner is not going to accept the value, if they're not accepting the combined values of these figures as being the value the respondent pension you are to have prior to the pre trial date an actuaries valuation of the pension you will have."

The police had stopped the respondent when they observed the passenger putting on a seat belt. When the respondent went to the police cruiser, the police observed signs of impairment.

The officer asked him to accompany her to his police cruiser and gave a breathalyzer demand without requiring a test with an ALERT screening device. The appellant failed the breathalyze test and was convicted of driving with an illegal blood alcohol level. The Crown appealed on the ground that the summary conviction appeal court erred respecting arbitrary detention and the exclusion of evidence of the breathalyszer result under s. 24(2) of the Charter. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction restored. 1)The Court held that the s. 8 of the Canadian Charter is a valid and constitutional legislative enactment. 2)The court held that s. 189a(1) of The Highway Traffic Act is valid and a constitutional legislative enactment. The wording of the s9 of the Act is broad enough to authorize random stops of motorists by police officers. The Court held the s7 of the act is a form of detention and, in this case, the accused was detained for the purposes of s. 10(b) of s9. The accused was convicted for failing to provide a breath sample. 3)The accused was not detained for any reason other than the fact that he was drinking. The court held the accused had reasonable and probable grounds to refuse to provide the breath sample and that his right to retain and instruct counsel was infringed."
7_1995canlii5894.txt,"The Defendants applied to sever the issues of liability and damages for purposes of the trial of this matter. The trial was to be held before a jury.HELD: 1)The Court has a general discretion as to severance of issues which must be exercised judicially. 2)Severance should only be ordered when the judge has a serious reason to believe that the trial of the issue proposed to be severed will put an end to the action. 3)The Court accepted the Plaintiff's submission that expert medical evidence would be necessary to establish the cause of the accident since the Plaintiff had suffered brain damage and would be unable to testify. This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found. 4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages. A jury cannot be disassembled and then recalled to conclude the trial of the remaining issues. 5)The Court was of the view that there should be compelling reasons before issues should be severed for trial, but that no compelling reason had been established in this case.","This was an application by the defendants for an order pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction severing the issues of liability and damages. HELD: An order for severance of the issues was granted. 1)The Court held that a trial of liability in favour of the defendants will render the issue of damages unnecessary; (b) given the quantum of damages claimed by the plaintiffs and the volume of evidence necessary to prove this aspect of the claim, the prior determination of the issue would result in a significant reduction in trial time and costs. 2)No jury, whether discharged or not, can be reassembled some time later to carry on with the second part of the trial. Such an examination of the injuries and how they sustained and/or the impact of the accident on the plaintiff will result in the appropriate quantum of damage. 3)The court emphasized that an application for severage of the questions should only be granted for the most compelling reasons and in cases in which it is probable that the trial of one issue will put an end to the action."

The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amount of on-going maintenance of $600 per month for his 2 daughters. An order suspending enforcement of arrears during periods when the respondent is unemployed was granted. The father was found not to be in compliance with the corollary relief judgment.

The mother was entitled to make a claim for support whenever she believed his contribution was inadequate, whether or not she perceived herself separated from him. 2)The primary purpose of a support order is not to compensate for past failure but to satisfy present need. Making a retroactive order would not address that purpose.

She claimed her former husband did not pay sufficient support when both she and the children were dependent upon him. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Court was not asked to address the issue of support until now. The primary purpose of a support order is not to recompensate for past failure but instead, to satisfy present need. Making a retroactive support order would not address that purpose. The claim was dismissed with costs. The court did not ask to address retroactive or transitional support. The purpose of the support order was not to satisfy past failure, but to satisfy a present need and making a retroactivity support order did not address the purpose."

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action.

He alleged that the failure of his former business Red Bull Enterprises Ltd. was a major reason for his failure. He sought an order of disbursement of $1,750 from Revenue Canada. The bankrupt argued that the Act required that affidavit evidence must be based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge. HELD: 1)The application for discharge was granted. The court found that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution. 2)The court found the principle and exemption contained in s.173(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act and ss.173/173(2)(d) and 173(1) did not exist. 3)The bankrupt's evidence was that it was their own fault he stopped making payments because they didn't do what he wanted them to do. The'my way or the door way' attitude was not proven. 4)The Court found that it could not accept that the principle of disclosure contained in ss.295(5)(a), of the Excise Tax Act would allow disclosure of the 'goods and services tax remittances of Clearsky in these bankruptproceedings. 5)The evidence would have been stronger if the Court had found that s.172(1(a) had been proven. 6)The issue of disclosure was not a matter of a final matter but of Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring affidavit evidence based upon personal knowledge of the bankrupt."

7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the Credit union held a security interest. The Claim arises from GARI's delay to remove from Garis land a fixture in which it held a Security Interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that the CreditUnion became tenant at sufferance of Garis when it failed to remove the quonsette and therefore was obliged to pay rent. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The evidence falls well short of proving that the plaintiff could have derived any rent from the property, had the building not been there, beyond the amount that the plaintiffs actually recovered. 2) The Court reviewed the evidence and found that it would have been improper for Gari to deny permission to remove a building unless the CreditU paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. That stance would have resulted in the plaintiff's claims in this regard having to pay the $3,500 security deposit returned to the Creditu. 3) The court reviewed the factors that led to the award of the judgment. 4) The trial court found that the evidence falls short of showing that the defendant could have obtained any rent or revenue from the premises beyond the sum that the defendants actually recovered from the building. 5) The fact that the credit union became a tenant at sufferingance of the Gari for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them was inconsistent with the regime established pursuant to the PPSA. The Court found that s. 36 of the PPA does not operate to preclude a general damage claim such as the one advanced by Gari. It would have be improper for the Creditunion to deny the building unless it paid an additional amount in the amount of property taxes. That would have put the plaintiff at an unfair disadvantage vis-à-vis financers and would allow financers to effectively'store' fixtures on the property."

The accused youth was charged with assault and dangerous driving. HELD: The youth was released on strict conditions. 1)The public was aware that we do not keep a person in custody simply because they are accused of committing an offence. There must be a necessary and substantial reason to keep a youth in custody before they have a trial. 2)The accused youth will create a lack of confidence in the administration of justice because of the occurrence of unrelated crimes by unrelated persons. 3)The court reviewed the circumstances surrounding the injuries to the victim and the circumstances of her release. The Crown argued its case was strong, the offence is horrible, and that the public in La Ronge and area are so disturbed and shocked by the occurrence, that to release the youth would cause a loss of confidence on the part of the public. 4)The Court agreed with the Crown's position that because several persons have told the police that this youth committed a serious offence, I should confrine her in custody even before her trial, even before the Crown has given evidence to her, under oath, in a court of law, and before her had a proper chance to stand trial. 5)The Public is aware that every person is presumed to be innocent until he or she is proven guilty at trial and there must be an necessary and significant reason to maintain a person's custody before their trial. There is no reason to confine her in the custody even after she has a trial even before someone has given her evidence against the youth, before someone had given her a chance in a trial or before she's had a opportunity to defend her. The Court agreed that there was no evidence at all that this young person will be danger if released, or that her release will cause any other danger to the community. The court accepted the youth's statement that there is no apparent or suggested connection between the three incidents referred to by the Crown and that it was the offender in one of the incidents who was apprehended, has pleaded guilty, and has been remanded pending sentence.

A reasonable cause of action is disclosed. 2) None of the affidavits filed speak to the circumstance wherein the impugned remarks were made. Most importantly, there is no assertion by the defendant that the remarks were made in the course of her duties or were received by persons with a corresponding duty.","FIAT: This is an application for an order striking out the plaintiff's claim in defamation. The statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action. That being so, a reasonable cause is disclosed and the quoted test has not been met. HELD: The application is dismissed. The court has jurisdiction to strike on this ground only in plain and obvious cases and where the court is satisfied that the case is beyond doubt. The test is whether a reasonable person can establish that the words spoken or written were published on a lawful occasion, that is a fairly warranted basis, that which is a 'fairly warranted by some reasonable occasion or exigency' and there is no assertion by the defendant that the remarks were made in the course of her duties or were received by persons with a corresponding duty.

7_2010nssc146.txt,"The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence. Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.",The accused brought an application for relief under s.24(1) of the Charter alleging that the Crown's intention to lead newly discovered evidence compromises her s. and 11(d) Charter rights. The accused claimed her right to make a full answer and defence to the charges against her was compromised by Crown non-disclosure. She sought exclusion of evidence or mistrial. The trial was held on the basis of the new evidence. The Crown had not disclosed the information until the day before the trial. The new evidence first came to Crown counsel's attention during a lunch break following the hearing of a voir dire and a day and one-half of evidence in the trial proper. Defence counsel was immediately notified and disclosure was provided within twenty-four hours of the Crown learning of the evidence. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court was satisfied that the accused had succeeded in proving a breach of her right of full answer. The court was not satisfied that a mistrial could be ordered. The evidence was so new as to be of significant importance to the accused. The only thing that could be retrieved was her right not to call defence evidence.

While the claim discloses a possible cause of action based on the Attorney General's statutory undertakings, this alone doesn't decide the matter. The amendments add nothing by way of necessary detail to the claim, which doesn't plead sufficient material facts to comply with the Rules on pleadings (see Rule 4.02).","The defendant AGC moved for summary judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.03 (1)(a) and (c) on the grounds that the plaintiff's amended statement of claim did not plead sufficient material facts to comply with the rules. The AGC argues that notwithstanding finding a cause of action, the plaintiff’s amended statementof claim does not plead enough material facts. While this is a significant factor, it does not necessarily defend against this summary judgment application based on the plea. HELD: The plaintiff had a cause for action arising from the statutory undertakings given by the AGC in 1996. While the statement of claims is a substantial factor, the amendments do not add to the statement. The plaintiff”s amended Statement of Claim does not add sufficient material information to comply the rules and the AGc argues that the amended statement is not a failure to proceed to forfeiture. The statement of defence does not provide clear authority that failure to move to forfeiture triggers these undertakings. The Court reviewed the relevant rules of pleadings and found that the statement was not deficient in any of the following ways: 1) a statement of a claim must notify the defendant of all the claims to be raised by the plaintiff at trial, conform with Rule 38 Pleading, provide notice to the other party of all claims, defences, or grounds to be raise by the party signing the pleading. 2) a declaration of claim must be made, including the title of the claim, the date of the declaration, the address of the property, the number of premises, the amount of time spent on the property and the amount that the defendant had to deal with the seizure and the number and amount of times he lost his house to foreclosure and his personal property was returned to him. 3) a claim for damages must be filed only on the pleading and no affidavit may be filed in support of or opposition to the motion. The court found that notwithstanding the finding of a cause to action, there was no recognized cause of claim and the plaintiff did not demonstrate a failure or a violation of the statutory undertaking. The defendant’ s.2(2) claim for property seized was dismissed because the Crown had not established a substantial property loss or dilapidation. 4) the statement and claim of claim was not based on a bald statement without any supporting details. The amendments did not add anything to the plaintiff statement of claimed."
7_2013skqb67.txt,"The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","The parties attended a settlement meeting and reached an agreement on seven issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit of October 16, 2012. The petitioner requested an order for interim exclusive possession of the family home. HELD: 1) The respondent was to pay child support of $1,213 per month commencing September 1, 2012 and payable on the first of each month thereafter. The parties agreed that the meeting was without prejudice. The issues include parenting, child support and spousal support.  2) The parties did not reach an agreement regarding seven issues and the respondent was entitled to interim exclusive custody of the home. 3) The whole of the settlement process is protected, that is, all communications in furtherance of settlement from the first utterance or letter to the last. The policy considerations which underly settlement privilege and as identified in Tucker-Lester require that unless all of the issues have been resolved, privilege continues to extend to those issues where there may have been a consensus unless there is a clear understanding and agreement that once one of the issue is resolved it is off the table and considered to be settled irrespective of what may happen with respect to other issues that may exist as between the parties. 4) The petitioner was to receive a credit for monies which he had paid from September 2012 onward. 5) The court struck the last three sentences of para. 4 and Exhibit A of Exhibit A from the petitioner’s affidavit of November 2012.  6) The Court concluded that the whole of settlement process was protected, the whole communications in a furtherance settlement from first utterances or letter and the corresponding monthly cashflow. The Court found that the respondent did not oppose remaining in the home on a time limited basis and suggested it should terminate June 27, 2013. The court noted that the circumstances at hand is to be distinguished from an application to enforce a settlement agreement where it is alleged that all issues have resolved. The order for the respondent to have exclusive possession and exclusive possession was granted. The costs were to be paid in installments of $500 per month. The respondents were to receive an order granting interim exclusive control of the house.  7) The respondents had been making the mortgage payments of $87,900 per month and paying utilities of $419 per month, utilities of a $419.00 per month for 187 school days per year.

8_1990canlii4256.txt,"Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility. Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.",The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. The child testified that she was at his house every Friday night for several years. She also testified that her stepfather touched her breasts and inside her pants. The Crown brought an assault charge against the appellant. The trial judge found that the complainant's evidence had been consistent throughout and had been given in a reasonable manner 'worthy of belief'. He also found that over the time period covered by the information he was left in little doubt that opportunities could and did present themselves for the appellant to have had a relationship with the complainant. The admission of the hearsay evidence of the appellant was an error so grave as to call for a quashing of the conviction.

8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The respondents were charged with fishing by means of net without licence. At trial, counsel for the respondents advanced standard criminal law defences to the charges, and also a constitutional defence that the respondents as Metis had an aboriginal right to fish for food. The trial judge found the accused not guilty on counts 1, 2 and 6 of the Constitution Act and found he would have convicted him on counts 7 and 8 but for the constitutional defence which he had established. The Crown argued that the accused had an Aboriginal right to fishing for food and an aboriginal rights defence. The accused argued that he had been fishing for commercial purposes for a long time and therefore his claim that the fishing Regulations infringed his aboriginal right was not supported. The respondents were Metis and had been fishermen for a number of years. The Court found the Crown did not intend to make commercial fishing an issue. The court found the defence did not have a strong aboriginal right and therefore the Court found it was not necessary to make this an issue for the Crown."

The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement. Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal.

The applicant's husband had given her personal letters, records and documents to his solicitor in 1995. These documents were relevant to a defamation action brought by her children or their spouses. The applicant argued that a fiduciary relationship was created when the documents were accepted which was close enough to a solicitor-client retainer to give rise to a need for confidentiality and that the public's confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined if any member of that law firm acted for the plaintiffs. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs. No solicitor-client relationship was created between the husband's lawyer and the applicant when the documents were received. There was no breach of confidentiality or conflict of interest as contemplated by Chapters IV and V of the Code of Professional Conduct.

No other duty existed relating the law law firm. None existed relating with the law firms which she was a member. 3)Since no solicitor- client relationship and no other duty was due to Lois, Lois Hudson was not required to take any action or refrain from doing anything.

He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.  3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment.","The Government of Saskatchewan tendered a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. Four companies submitted tenders in response to the defendant's invitation to tender. The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender. HELD: The plaintiff paid $1,000 for the lowest bid and $1 million for the highest bid. The contract was awarded to Nielsen Ashdown who had previous experience in the area and whose planes received favourable reports. The court awarded the contract to Nielsen. The defendant, the Government of S.A., awarded the spruce bw worm aerial spray program to the plaintiff. The plaintiffs sued for damages. The Court found that the plaintiff compensated for its lack of experience by bringing on board an experienced sub-contractor. The expert did not know at the time that he made his recommendation. The plane of the type the plaintiff proposed to use, on this project, was used in similar spraying programs in subsequent years. The award of the spruced up spruce tree worm aerial program was awarded. The Plaintiff compensated by bringing an experienced pilot on board. The applicant did not check the log books of any of the planes he investigated because he testified it was not common practice to do so and it would have given him little relevant information on the operational viability of the plane.

8_2006skqb274.txt,"DIGEST The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000. HELD: 1) The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents. The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public. The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry. This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.  2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000. The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'. Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit. 3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.","The appellants were convicted by a provincial court judge of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and the Health Of Animals Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The sentence was not sufficient to deter the offender from committing the offences. 2)The fines were not sufficient. 3)The Court of Appeal did not err in its interpretation of the statutory default calculations. The Court of appeal did not raise the issue of whether the fines should be increased. 4)The maximum fines prescribed by the Criminal Code are $750,000 and the total fine of approximately $69.000 was reduced to $69 per count. 5)The total fine was reduced from $200,000 to $4000. 6)The court of appeal made a finding that the sentences were too severe and the sentences exceeded that of the general offender. 7)The sentencing judge did not take into account the rehabilitation of the individual."
8_2007skpc1.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","The accused applied for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: The Court found there was a Charter breach and granted a stay of proceedings.  1)The accused did not contribute to the remaining delay. There were some delays attributable to the accused in time until she was ready to enter pleas, later until she could have the matter rescheduled for trial. Otherwise, she appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charges set for trial; 2)The weather caused delay from November 29, 2006 to January 19, 2007. 3)The court found prejudice to the complainant because the outstanding charge has affected her ability to apply for higher-paying job opportunities and has caused her stress and frustration. The Court also found prejudice in the nature of the offences caused by the delay."
8_2008nssc358.txt,"The corollary relief judgment provided that the parties would share parenting of their two children approximately equally. Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue. Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms.","The parties were married for 11 years and had two children, aged 12 and 7. The Husband asked the court to vary the child support terms of the Corollary Relief Judgment as varied by way of consent order dated May 1, 2007. The applicant sought to vary child support based on the former wife's income and a decline in her income. The previous variation order was a consent order. The Court was not prepared to retroactively vary the terms of that order. HELD: The previous order was not a consent judgment. The court was not seeking to retroactive the order. 1)The applicant's income for child support purposes was $18,593. The amount of child support paid was $1,268.00. The former wife operated her own business which produced negligible income. She was required to work part-time and was unable to pay child support. 2)The Court was prepared to vary her child support by way to a date prior to the date of the last order effective on a date that was prior to her last order. 3)The amount of support payable was adjusted for inflation and the amount of spousal support was increased. 4)The respondent's RRSP income was a recurring income figure over the past four years. It was a monthly income figure that was a significant income figure. It is not an adjustment contemplated by Schedule III."
8_2011skca35.txt,"The applicants applied for leave to appeal from a Chambers decision denying their application to dismiss the respondent's claim against them for want of prosecution. The applicants were partners in an architecture firm that provided design drawing and specifications for the construction of the Education Building at the University of Saskatchewan. The building was substantially completed in 1970. In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building. In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss. In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief. In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer. The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997. Between 1997 and 2010, documents were exchanged, discoveries were held and an unsuccessful settlement negotiation was held. In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution. The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant. Secondly, the issue of delays in litigation is important and the case will present an opportunity for the Court to clarify the legal framework pertaining to such matters.","The applicants were defendants in an action commenced by the Respondent, University of Saskatchewan. They applied to have the University's claim against them dismissed for want of prosecution but were unsuccessful. They sought leave to appeal that decision. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted. 1) The court found that the plaintiffs' negligence claim was not of sufficient importance to succeed. 2) The standard of review applied in respect of decisions such as the one in issue here will present some difficulty for the applicants on appeal. Nonetheless, there is enough merit in their position to warrant granting leave. 3) The Court found that there was enough merit to warrant the Court granting leave to review the appeal."
8_2011skpc3.txt,"The accused asserted that his rights to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached because the police officer did not bring a list of lawyers to the accused's attention and the accused did not have access to it. The officer may not have drawn the presence of a telephone book to the accused's attention. The officer dialed the number for Legal Aid duty counsel for the accused and the accused spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel prior to providing breath samples of 190 milligrams and 180 milligrams. The accused never indicated that he wished to contact other counsel. HELD: Following a voir dire, the accused's application to exclude evidence was dismissed. The accused had not succeeded in establishing on a balance of probabilities that the accused's right to consult counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been violated. The accused was entirely disinterested in consulting with counsel as was his right and was clear and unequivocal in his waiver of rights to counsel. Alternatively, the accused failed to indicate a desire to exercise his right to counsel.","The accused was charged with impaired operation of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. He had alleged in that regard, a breach of his rights to counsel of choice under s. 10(b) and s. s. 24 of the Charter. HELD: The accused was released from custody.  1) The Court reviewed the evidence and found that the accused had waived his right to counsel pursuant to s9(b). 2) The accused had not been aware of the officer's instructions regarding the use of a phone book when he was placed in the phone room. 3) The officer had not asked the accused if he was satisfied with the consultation with Legal Aid and had no desire to contact another lawyer. 4) The evidence was excluded pursuant to the Charter on the basis that the officer had failed to provide reasonable opportunity to the accused."
8_2013skqb397.txt,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction. The applicants were trying to use habeas corpus when they actually were seeking a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies were available only through the Federal Court.","HELD: The application was granted. The Court declined its jurisdiction to grant a remedy on the application guised as a habeas corpus application. The applicants were seeking to challenge administrative decisions of the Correctional Service of Canada which do not impact their residual liberty. The true character of the remedies being sought by the applicants is a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process. Habeas corpus is a guarantee of liberty, not a channel for drawing our Court into the day-to-day management of prison. HELD: 1) The applicants had been serving their 'life' or 'indeterminate' sentences at the medium security Saskatchewan Penitentiary until they were both transferred this year to the minimum security Riverbend Annex. While the applicants have framed their application under the pretence of habeaas corpus, the true character is a petition of certicialari, mandamus, prohibition, prohibition and mandamus and these remedies fall outside the exclusive territory of the federal court of Canada. These remedy fall within exclusive jurisdiction through a review process and fall within their exclusive jurisdiction to the Federal court of jurisdiction through the judicial review. These remedial remedies fall in the exclusive exclusive jurisdiction and jurisdiction of The Federal Court. Hearsay for the applicants, habeaus corpus is not for this Court to determine the reasonableness of the administrative decisions made by the Correctional Services of Canada within the confines of its jurisdiction. HABEAS: The Court's jurisdiction to award remedies against federal institutions and decision-makers is narrow. It is not necessary for this court to determine how the Court to decide the reason for the administrative decision of the correctional service within the boundaries of its own jurisdiction. The court assumes that neither of the applicants' situations have changed for the purpose of rendering this decision. While both the applicants and Sinobert have framed themselves as an application under a pretence, the real character of their remedies being seek by them is a Writ of certi, certioraris, prohibition of mandamus or mandam. These are remedies fall under the exclusive and exclusive jurisdiction OF the Federal COURT of Canada, through a process of judicial review, and therefore fall within its exclusive jurisdiction. These resources fall within an exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal Courts through a Judicial Review process.

9_1996canlii6809.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff brought an action against five defendants claiming fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a skin rash were the result of silicone implants. One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","FIAT. The statement of claim was served ex juris upon all the defendants. At this time the plaintiff alleged that her condition was a result of silicone breast implants manufactured by the defendant Dow Chemical Company. The defendant denied liability and asserted that the plaintiffs actions were not caused by negligence attributed to the defendant. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The statement of claims did not disclose wrongful conduct on the part of the defendant, the Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract and it is appropriate for this Court to assume jurisdiction in respect to the claim as it relates to that particular defendant. 2)The statements of claim did not state that the plaintiff's damages were caused by the defendants, the defendant was not resident in Saskatchewan and had no direct or real connection to the province. 3)The pleadings portray nothing more than a relationship akin to that of vicarious liability between the defendant and one of the other defendants, namely, Dow Corning Corporation. 4)The defendant is not resident here and has no direct and real connection with the province as it is not a publicly held corporation. The Defendants are at law responsible for the liabilities of the Dow chemical company in both and contract. It is appropriate that this Court assume jurisdiction as it will exercise jurisdiction in relation to the action as it was previously exercised by the Dow Company.

9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","The deceased's widow received a death benefit for herself and two children. She took issue with the calculation of the death benefit, which was based on the percentage of her late husband's net income rather than on his gross income. She appealed the decision to the Court of Queen's Bench. HELD: The deceased's estate was awarded a lump sum of $50,000. The deceased was entitled to $350 per week for the next 14 days and $400 for two children, ages 12 and 12. The estate was entitled $500 per month for the first 14 days. The death benefit was to be paid to the surviving spouse on a weekly basis. The ordinary meaning of this was that the payment was made to the survivor on a monthly basis."
9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.",The accused was 19 years old at the time of the accident and had just passed a pedestrian crossing. He was driving a light colored Audi that passed him at high speed and was stopped for a traffic light. The accused was charged with dangerous driving causing death. The Crown argued that a sentence in the lower end of the range is one which should be served intermittently. HELD: The accused is sentenced to 90 days in the Provincial Correctional Centre. 1)The Court of Appeal has reviewed the sentencing principles of sentencing and found that a range of sentences for dangerous driving is appropriate. 2)The accused is prohibited from driving in the city. 3)The Crown has not considered the impact of his previous convictions on the public.
9_1999canlii12597.txt,"The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action. The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act which:(a)restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the respondent or his solicitors in relation to the petitioner's claim in Queen's Bench Action No. Q.B.G. No. 2270/97, J.C. Regina (the “Action”), pending the petitioner’s application or further court order;(b)rests the respondent from disposing of any of the monies that he has received or may receive in relation the Action or any claim against the Attorney general of Canada pending the respondent’ s application or a further court decision;(c)restricts the AttorneyGeneral from releasing any monied monies or otherwise failing to use them to support his family;(d)restraints the respondent on disposing any of any monying or receiving monies in relation thereto;(e)restorts the respondent to dispose of any funds that he received or has received in relation or any other purpose;(f)restains the respondent and his solicitor from releasing monies received or receiving in relationto the Action;(g)restralizes the respondent for disposing or receiving any monys that he may receive or otherwise fail to use to support their family; and(c)(d)remains the appellant from releasing and paying any of monies."
9_2003skqb229.txt,"An appeal of conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (Criminal Code s.255 and s.253) on the grounds of misdirection in finding there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to impairment; an incorrect inference and failure to give correct legal effect to the facts as found including the lack of evidence of impairment at the material time while he was in care or control of the vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence. Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence. The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.  2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838). However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba). A properly instructed jury could have arrived at the same inference on the facts as found.","The accused was convicted of driving while his ability to operate was impaired by alcohol or drugs contrary to s. 255 and 253 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge misdirected herself in finding that the trial judge found sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant's ability to operating a motor vehicle was impaired. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge made no palpable or overriding error in her assessment of the evidence, her interpretation of the law, her application of the applicable law to the evidence and her application to the facts. 2)The Court was satisfied that the judge's findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment by alcohol were supported by the evidence. Direct evidence confirms that the accused's condition did not change for the period that he was in the driver's seat and if impairment is proven, which is the next issue will deal with, then it applies equally to when he was first observed in the vehicle as to later observed in it. 3)The court found that the inference made by the trial Judge was one that a properly instructed jury could have arrived at on the facts in the instant case and therefore should not be interfered with. The Court found that, while the accused may have had care and controlled of his motor vehicle at the time he was observed, there was sufficient evidence to draw the conclusion beyond a reasonably reasonable doubt. The judge made the following observations: 1)the appellant's condition was not change during the period he was driving. 2b)the trial judge failed to give a correct legal effect to the fact that there was insufficient evidence beyond the reasonable doubt to conclude that the Appellant's ability was impaired; 3)the Court found no palpable and overriding error of her assessment and assessment of evidence, or her interpretation and her analysis of the facts, or the application of law to to the Evidence. The appeal therefore was dismissed with costs."
9_2008skqb301.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT: The parties to this action have reached an impasse on the required disclosure and seek various orders. The defendants ask that the Court exercise its discretion and sever the plaintiffs' claim between liability and damages. The defendant also seeks an order that certain paragraphs of the plaintiffs’ claim be struck. HELD: The defendants’ application to strike portions of the claim is dismissed. 1) The court reviewed the Queen’s Bench Rules and the Queen's Bench Rules. The issues in this action are such that delay in full disclosure of material pertaining to damages makes little difference. Both parties know the profitability of the consulting business. The risks that must be weighed in considering settlement pertain to liability. 2) The defendants have developed relationships with accounting firms, industry associations, post-secondary learning institutions and various business organizations. Much of the defendants‘ client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants and their obligation to maintain this confidence. The court granted the order to strike these portions of their claim. 3) The Court reviewed the issues in the case of Anderson Preece Associates Inc. v. Dominion Appraisal Group Inc. (1986), 54 O.R. (2d) 425 (Ont. H.C.). The Court found that the plaintiffs had developed their own SR&ED application process by cultivating relationships with industry associations and post-school learning institutions. The plaintiffs had no assurance that the defendants were not pursuing their clients. That is not valid concern because the plaintiffs already have an immediate remedy should the defendants poach their clients if the defendants are poaching their clients and the plaintiffs can easily discern if the plaintiffs are breaching that order. At this stage, no breach has been alleged."

The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received.

It was clear that the accused was confused and not focused on the present and that his mind had wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial as opposed to his immediate right to have counsel. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty that the officer should have made an effort to clarify the informational component of the right to counsel.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and use or threatened use of weapon. The Crown sought admission of the accused's inculpatory statements. The accused's mind wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial. The Court did not believe he was focussed on the present and his immediate right to have counsel then and there before he made any statement to the police. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty to make it impossible for the police to make a clarification such as, 'Brian, you have the right to counsel now before you make any statement.' HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. The court found that the accused wandered off from his Charter right to consult counsel and that he did not have a disability. The only thing that could have led him to this conclusion was that he had not been aware of his rights at the outset and that his choice to not avail himself of immediate counsel was not made in bad faith. The police were not obligated to go beyond the information required to comply with the informational component of s.10(b). The accused had not made a conscious choice to make this statement. The fact that he chose not to avail himself or immediate counsel and made an informed decision to seek counsel of John Black when he went to court was a clear indication that he was not in a state of addiction. The evidence of the police officers was that they knew the accused and they were aware of the danger he posed to others. The officer's words were muttered and hard to interpret but appeared to be 'Nah. There's a guy down around there anyway.' The officer was not aware that the complainant had a problem with alcohol. The complainant was not intoxicated at the time of the assault and the police were aware that he could not be relied upon to provide counsel. The trial judge found that there was a low threshold for the accused to wander off to his right to be advised of his right and to have his right not to be distracted by the 'cognitive dissonance' of the statement."
9_2011skpc15.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused was charged with mischief under $5,000 and aggravated assault. The major issue for determination was whether the accused can be convicted of both charges. HELD: The accused was convicted of mischief. The court found that the mens rea required for s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code, is objective foresight of bodily harm. It is not necessary that there be an intent to wound or maim or disfigure. The section pertains to an assault that has the consequences of wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim. The Crown had established that the accused must be convicted for assault causing bodily harm as the evidence fell short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused is guilty of both the charge of mischief and aggravated assaulting."
9_2014skqb386.txt,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction pursuant to s813 of the Code. HELD: The appeal was granted and a new trial ordered. 1) The Court found that the appellant rebutted the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) of s.258(b), which established three prerequisites to be met by an accused attempting to establish 'evidence to the contrary' so as to rebut the presumption of accuracy, were retrospective. The Court also found that, in the circumstances of the case, the appellant was definitely in actual care and controlling. 2) The trial judge found that there was no evidence that the accused rebutting the presumption that the person who occupies the driver's seat is deemed to have care and care and that the police stop which resulted in the determination that the respondent's blood exceeded the approved level, constituted an arbitrary detention contrary to the Charter. The appellant rebuted the presumption and rebutts the presumption, rebuting the presumption by the 2008 amendments to s258(1(b)(iv), which establish three pre-requisites to establish “evidence to rebunt the presumption to the accuracy,” and found that he was in actual control. The appeal is granted and new trial order. 3) The court found that it was sufficient that the Court found the appellant in the appellant's circumstances to reburge the presumption. The trial court found the accused in the 2008 amendment to s253(1) of ss258(c)(iii) to rebute the presumption which established a three-pronged approach to the criminal justice system. The evidence from the 2008 and 2009 amendments to ss258 and s258 of the criminal code was rebutt. The accused rebuted that presumption and established that the'reasonable person' who occupies a driver's position is deemed 'care and control'. The Court held that the 2008 changes in s258 (1)(b) were retrospective and as such, retrospective. It found that they were retrospective, and as a result, applied to this charge. The court also found the 2008 amended s258 amendments to the Criminal code were retrospective in their retrospective application. The only thing the Court held was that the trial judge erred in finding that the evidence of the appellant who was in care and controlled of his vehicle was retrospective and"

a_1993canlii6596.txt,"Appeal from 107 SaskR 135, 44 RFL(3d)185. Appeal from a judgment directing matrimonial property. The main issue was whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated. The couple's marriage had lasted less than four years. HELD: The QB judgment was upheld regarding the severance package. The severance package was not a reward for past service; it was for payment in lieu of reasonable notice of termination. The severance package was based on future earnings, which would have occurred within the duration of the marriage. The QB judge did however fail to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give the husband his one-half share of them. Judgment varied accordingly.","The wife and husband were married for 23 years. They lived together until 1991 when they commenced living separate and apart under the same roof. The husband commenced proceedings for divorce and division of matrimonial property. He was recently and unexpectedly terminated. The wife and the husband commenced a divorce and commenced proceedings to divide matrimony property. The judge awarded a severance package of $110,000.00. The severance was based on 20.4 months of future earnings. If the severance pay was additional remuneration given as a reward for past service, it should be shareable to the extent that it is attributable to past service during the existence of the marital relationship. The termination of his employment came as a complete surprise to the husband. After 23 years of service, he was told that it was not working and he was still invested in R.R.S.P.'s with Maritime Life Assurance. The marriage was therefore not working. The award of $36,000 was for payment in lieu of reasonable notice of termination. The parties had agreed to an amount of 20. 4 months of deferred earnings. The court allowed the appeal to the maximum extent referred to."

The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","The defendant appealed from a judgment for damages pronounced in Queen's Bench.

The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules.","The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as driver and driver's helper. He was dismissed from his employment without notice. The defendant had been monitoring his truck for several years and had been making regular breaks for the plaintiff. The plaintiff had taken breaks during his shift as a result of the truck's frequent stops.

b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that reserve on the matter of costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now shows that substantial offers were made through counsel for the parties although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The applicant argues that the position taken before Wimmer J.

The respondent argued that the same position was held by the applicant (who argued that it needed to know the full extent of the estate so as to properly determine the applicant's entitlement to the estate) and that the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. HELD: The application for a fixed award of costs is dismissed. The court has found that the respondent's offer was not appropriate.

The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident.

Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5). It is the total amount payable as a death benefit. The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero.

In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants.

HELD: The application was allowed and the decision was quashed. The court found that the Commission had exceeded the jurisdiction it was bound to exercise.

Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met. The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them. Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional. Neither parent could, nor wished to, change in the foreseeable future.","The mother applied for a permanent care application for four children. The mother had been in temporary care for several months and had been experiencing some issues with her children. She had been diagnosed with a form of ADD and had some form of severe mental retardation. The father had prescribed antifungals and anti-inflammatory medication. The children had been living with the mother for approximately one-half of their short lifetime. The parents had informal involvement with the Agency since 1996. The Agency had made a referral to Children's Aid when the mother was expecting her second child, S.M., who died at fifteen months of age. The agency had made an assessment of the mother and found that she had a formof ADD. The child had been exposed to head lice and had had several previous medical problems. The family had been receiving support from the Agency and the Agency. The application was granted and the mother's medical history was examined. The court found that the mother had a mild five code type and the child had a slight five codetype. The Court found that this code type was relatively infrequent and occurs more in women than men. The Assessment found that it was made under 22(2)(b) pursuant to s40(3) and that finding was made with respect to the mother. The Family Skills Worker was accepted as witness capable of giving opinion evidence in the area of parental capacity. The Children's Assessment was held at the conclusion of the hearing. The evidence was that the child was diagnosed with ADD and was in good physical health. The assessment was conducted by the Agency's Director of Child and Family Services. The Child and Adult Services Director was accepted. The Permanent Care Application was granted. The applicant was given the option of either moving to an apartment or moving to a more comfortable location. The nature of the child's tattoos was unknown. The only thing that was known was that she was a very social person and had a tendency to be aggressive towards her friends. The fact that she did not have any of the above was not a factor in her decision to move to an apartments. The Application was also granted."

The accused had previously applied to a Provincial Court judge, who had declined the accused's application. The issue was whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused's application for judicial interim release.

The hearing on his interim judicial release was held before the Provincial Court judge. The Provincial Court declined the accused's application for interim judicial custody on the grounds that the accused was in the community awaiting trial and would erode the public's confidence in the administration of justice. The Crown applied for a determination of two preliminary issues: whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused’s application for judicial interim release; whether the Provincial court judge in the Youth Criminal Justice Act had jurisdiction in the matter of interim judicial disclosure on the basis that the youth’’ presence in the communities awaiting trial would eramp the public’S confidence in their administration of the justice system. HELD: The accused was granted interim judicial detention pending his preliminary inquiry. The issue then becomes whether the provincial court judge had jurisdiction on the issue of interim custody on a charge of murder.  1) Whether the Youth court judge has jurisdiction to determine the application for a judicial interim custody; whether this honourable court has jurisdiction in conduct review of the Youth offender’ s decision.  2) Whether this honourably court has the jurisdiction to conduct review. The jurisdiction for determination of interim detention on an offence of this nature rests solely with the superior court of criminal jurisdiction which in the Province of Saskatchewan is the Court of Queen’�s Bench. 3) Whether a judge of the superior Court has jurisdiction, if this honourability court has a jurisdiction to review the Youth Offender’d’ll’ve’t decision. 4) Whether it has jurisdiction for the youth charged with an offence set out in s. 522 of the Criminal Code. 5) Whether there was a determination in the Young Offender's Act of 2002 of jurisdiction for interim custody of the accused pending his trial. 6) Whether any court, judge or justice, other than a judge presiding in a superior court or justice for the province in which the accused is so charged, may release the accused before or after the accused has been ordered to stand trial. 7) Whether an act of the parliament of Canada was to limit that jurisdiction. 8) Whether another act of Parliament of Canada has jurisdiction.

Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle. There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3) Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.

b_2005nssf21.txt,"The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.","The parties were married for 15 years and had three children. The matrimonial home was purchased by the parties after their separation. The parties were engaged in a business relationship and the children had resided with the mother for the past ten years. The mother sought periodic support but did not seek a lump sum payment to cover tuition at the Atlantic School of Theology. The father argued that the matrimonious home was a business asset and must be divided equally. The court found that the piano lessons and musical instruments were extraordinary expenses for extracurricular activities and were necessary and reasonable. The Court did not include the soccer, tennis or horseback riding in this category. The children were to spend Father's Day with the father and Mother's Day together with the other children."
b_2008nspc5.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was revoked when he was found operating an all terrain vehicle (ATV) on a highway. Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along a highway. His driver's license was revoked and he was charged with driving a prohibited vehicle on the highway while his license was suspended. At the time his driver's licence was revoked, he was driving a motor vehicle on public highways by himself. The accused was charged under s.287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act with driving while his licence was suspended and driving while he was required to be registered. At trial, the Crown argued that because the accused was driving motor vehicle, he is guilty of the offence of driving a vehicle on a highway while he is revoked, but the charge is dismissed. The defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2), do not include an ATV and even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an AT vehicle on this highway. HELD: The accused is not guilty of driving while driving and his license is revoked. The use of an ATv on public highway is clearly prohibited under the Motor vehicle Act. The words'motivator' in the Act include only those types of vehicles for which one can obtain a license to drive it on the road. The word'mobil vehicle' does not include a vehicle and even in this case the accused could be charged with an offence of operating motor vehicle and for speeding since he was never a licensed to operate an AT. The Crown argued the words “motorveh” are used within the sections of the motor vehicle Act to determine whether the provision applies to the use of ATV’s or other prohibited vehicles. The offence was clearly prohibited by the Motor Vehicles Act. Hearsay: The words ‘motor Vehicle’ in s287(3) do not exclude an AT Vehicle and even though those words do, the Court found that the accused is guilty. The Court found the accused guilty of both charges. The'motive vehicle' is used within s.303(2). The use is clearly a motor Vehicle offence under the Act. It is not obvious that the offence is committed by the accused. The only issue at trial is whether this makes the accused a guilty of this offence. The wording'mobiles' in ss.287 and 11 of the Act are only those type of vehicles that one can legally obtain a licence to drive on the roadway. The Words 'ATV' include only these"
b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The mother applied to vary the maintenance for her daughters, aged 18 and 19, on the basis that the father had withdrawn from the charge and was no longer in arrears of maintenance. She also applied for determination that the daughter was in arrea-tion and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The trial judge found that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father and that there was no order for retroactive maintenance. The court found that there had been no palpable and overriding error in finding that the girls were not in arrebars of their father and the Court found that it would not be just and equitable to require the father to pay the $26,730.54. Even if the circumstances as a whole were construed as a unilateral withdrawal by the daughters, the high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met. The Court found the daughters were no longer children of the marriage. The test for determining whether a child is still dependent and to what extent is the Court's finding clearly wrong. The evidence does not show that the mother unilaterally withdrew from the father. The high threshold is high for finding that a child's termination of the relationship with a parent is determinative of the child's status and entitlement to maintenance. Even though the circumstances are interpreted as a declaration that the parties are still dependent, the Court cannot say that the Court disentitled the daughters from the relationship. The fact that the court found the father in arbars of support and that the maintenance he paid in the past for them was sufficient and appropriate. The appeal court found there was an error in principle or a significant misapprehension of the evidence with respect to the issue. The judge found there had not been an error of principle or significant misapplication of the facts with respect the issue and that it was not unreasonable to require a finding of this kind. The issue was whether the daughters had unilaterally withdrawn from their relationship with their father."
b_2010skca58.txt,"The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident. He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial. No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.","The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.

b_2010skqb249.txt,"The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","The plaintiff claims his personal and professional reputation has been seriously damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. The defendants have alleged that he was defamed. However, the defendants have accepted the defendants' defence of qualified privilege. HELD: The plaintiff has proven that he is defamed and the defendants are guilty of defamating him. The court accepts the defendants defence of 'qualified privilege' and accepts the plaintiff's defence of the plaintiff’s right to due process. The Court accepts the defence of “unfounded and without substance”. The plaintiff”s claim is dismissed. The action for damages is also dismissed."
b_2012skqb443.txt,The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their children. The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner. The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal. HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it. The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it. The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.,"FIAT: The application at bar is another salvo in a bitter custody and access dispute. The respondent has instructed the petitioner to forward the following without prejudice proposal in order to attempt settlement of the parties parenting and child support matters. The letter goes on to set out a detailed offer of settlement. HELD: 1) The privilege is a jointly held privilege that cannot be waived by any one party acting alone. This privilege is fundamental to the policy interest of promoting settlement discussions as means to avoiding trial. It should only be set aside if there is a very compelling, competing policy warranting such a proposal. As settlement communications are almost always irrelevant to the issues that are properly considered by the Court, it is rare that there will be any competing policy or, indeed, any reason to reference them at all. The application is another Salvo in the custody and accessing dispute. 2) The respondent exhibited a letter to the petitioner's counsel that was from his counsel to the respondent's counsel. The letters were marked 'Without Prejudice' and began with: 'Without prejudice'. 3) Just as promised, the letter goes onto set out detailed, comprehensive offer of a settlement. Although the law is clear that settlement proposals should seldom be made known to the Court it happens too often and for no good reason. It is common sense that settlement is less likely if the parties do not engage in full and frank discussions at all if such could later be used to their detriment. The privilege was clearly an important one and in cases of doubt as to whether the correspondence does relate to the negotiations, the Court should err on the side of protecting the privilege."

The accused took no position. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. Making an order for video-conferencing for non- participating persons was not permitted because the Court had no control over the policing of the courtroom in Ontario. It would set a dangerous precedent that could result in multiple applications being made in future trials by numerous interested parties in different jurisdictions over which the Court had no control.","The applicant Government of Saskatchewan, Victim Services Branch, brought a motion before the trial judge for an order permitting a live audio/video broadcast from a Court of Queen's Bench courtroom in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, to a courtroom in a court house in the Greater Toronto area, Ontario, for the exclusive benefit of the family of the deceased. The trial originally was set for a three week jury trial, but the applicant brought a new motion before myself as trial judge. The applicant Government moved before the Queen for an interim order permitting live audio video broadcast from the Court of the Queen'sBench courtroom in Saskatchewan to a court in a courtroom outside Toronto for the sole benefit of his family. The Queen consented to the draft order filed by the applicant and the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)Although this Court certainly has inherent jurisdiction to govern its own process within its own court within the Province of Saskatchewan it has no jurisdiction to make any orders involving facilities and personnel in the Province. It is very concerned about the possible ramifications of granting an order allowing video conferencing for the benefit of a family in Saskatchewan. 2)The court was very concerned that the application would set a dangerous precedent. It was not prepared to accept the argument that a courtroom where only the applicant's family would be in attendance is just an extension of the courtroom in the Saskatoon courtroom in another province over which this Court has no control or control. 3)The application was both novel and unprecedented. Saskatchewan has developed protocol for accommodating the participants of the trial process including witnesses, lawyers and judges within the trial. The Court was presented with no case authority in which court has ever made an order for video confording for the purposes of specific non-participating persons within Saskatchewan let alone another province. This believe is for several very good reasons."

If the three years for making such an application expires without an application being made, the limitation period begins to run again. The notice of extension in this case expired in 2009 and the limitation clock began to run again. The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce the respondent’s mortgage has expired and the registration of the mortgage is ordered discharged.","The applicant asks that the registration of mortgage against land be discharged on the basis that the limitation period to enforce the mortgage has expired. The respondent says the limitation time has not expired because The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, S.S. 1988-89, c. S-17.1 (the “Farm Security Act”) provides for a suspension of limitation time running while certain proceedings are underway pursuant to that Farm Security act. HELD: The notice of extension having expired on February 28, 2009, the limitation clock began to run again. Given the limitation had substantially expired before the service of the initial notice of intention, once the clock began running again it expired within the day."
b_2016skqb29.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made in 2005. The court assumed that the imputation was correct. The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them. The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","The respondent applied for an order to discontinue his obligation to pay both child and spousal support and for all support arrears to be expunged. He relies upon s. 17 of the Divorce Act and s. 14 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. HELD: The respondent was granted an order of adjustment to the amount of child support he was owed. The court found the respondent had failed in his onus for the years 2005 through to 2012. The arrear of support was $55,120. The respondent had been in arreary for the past 10 years. The Court found the petitioner had not demonstrated any change in his ability to earn income. The order was made some time ago by McIntyre J. The onus is on the respondent to justify the need for change. The petitioner has not demonstrated that he could not earn income from 2005 to 2013. The evidence of the former partners continued to be relevant. The children were responsible for one-third of the expenses. The respondents were awarded spousals for the period 2005 through 2012."

The judge at preliminary inquiry concluded that there was evidence adduced that the accused had paid money to the man who had killed the victim the day after the killing, that she was involved in cleaning the apartment where the killing took place after the body was removed, and that the accused and the man who killed the victim had discussed the matter prior to the event, and thus there was sufficient evidence upon which a 'properly instructed jury may find...[the accused] guilty...' The appellant contended that the judge had applied the wrong test for committal. Dismissing the application, that the question is not whether the judge correctly verbalized the test, but rather if the evidence supported the committal, and there was, indeed, enough circumstantial evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed and acting reasonably in accordance with those instructions, could convict the accused of first degree murder.","This was an application for an order in the nature of Habeas Corpus and an order for an Order in the form of Certiorari in aid.

For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs.

At the time of the fire there were two insurance policies in place for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff.

When the defendant notified the plaintiff that it was going to cancel the policy, the plaintiff placed a second policy on the property. The fire occurred less than a day before the first policy was to be cancelled. The defendant refused to honour the policy. It claimed that the formal Proof of Loss filed by the plaintiff was fraudulent, as it failed to disclose the existence of the second policy. Finding for the plaintiff, that the defendant has not satisfied the heavy burden of producing clear and satisfactory evidence that the plaintiff, through its employees, acted wilfully and knowingly to claim the benefit of coverage to which it was not entitled.","FIander, the insurance adjuster for Canada Trustco, was the agent for the mortgage company.

During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff. The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended. She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause. She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice. Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice, that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice. This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause.","The plaintiff was dismissed from her employment with the defendant after she refused to return to work on a reduced basis. She was awarded damages on the basis of eight months salary at the rate she was receiving at the time of her employment, plus vacation pay of 6 percent per annum. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had not been properly informed of the proposed changes in the terms of her contract and that she was constructively dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded punitive damages for failing to provide proper notice to the employer of the changes. The court found that the defendant put forth a 'take it or leave it' proposition to the plaintiff and that the employee was constructually dismissed. HELD: The Court found that an appropriate and proper period of notice was 8 months. The Court also found that there was no evidence that the employer intended to get rid of the employee. The employee was awarded costs of the dismissal on the order of $9,000 plus $5,000 vacation pay. The amount of damages awarded was 8.5 months."
c_1998canlii13762.txt,"The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s27 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell them the lands which were subject to their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation. The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution. The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal. There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which were subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act.

The defendant counterclaimed and sought costs of the action. The court found that the wording of s27(2(b)(ii) of s28 was that both refer to a letter of commitment to finance; not a letter to finance, and not a 'letter of credit binding' the financial institution to advance money in any event.

c_1999canlii12484.txt,"In issue was whether the law firm was in a conflict of interest with respect to two matrimonial files and whether the firm could remain as counsel for the spouses. HELD: 1)A lawyer with Olive Waller acts as counsel for Janie Magnes and Daniel L'Heureux. The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm. At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes. She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses. 2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case. There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur. There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening. Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her. The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet. The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter. The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs.","This was an application for a determination as to whether the law firm of Olive, Waller, Zinkhan & Waller was in a position of conflict of interest with respect to the matrimonial files of Magnes and D.A.L. and whether the firm may remain as counsel for Janie Magnes in those proceedings. HELD: The screen was sufficient in the circumstances of this case and there was not a risk of real mischief in this case. The law firm had put in place many of the screening measures suggested by the Guidelines in the Code. The applicant was not to work on the files but was to have access to the information. The screening measures were implemented so that no disclosure would occur. The application for an order of court was granted. The court found that the screen was adequate and that there was no risk of disclosure. The applicants were to continue to represent the former client. The evidence filed by the applicant was that all the screening steps were taken to ensure that no disclosures to any member of the new law firm was adhered to. The only person who had any connection with the files was the applicant's lawyer. The screen is sufficient in this situation and there is not a real risk of a real mischief. The test that is to be applied to determine whether the Law Society of Saskatchewan is in a conflict of interests is whether the applicant is in the position of being in a direct or indirect conflict of Interest with respect the matrionial files. The Court found that there is a general presumption that such confidential information passes between lawyer and client by virtue of the solicitor and client relationship, unless the lawyer satisfies that there has no such receipt of confidential information. All the screening actions, with the exception of the computer file segregation occurred prior to the arrival of the applicant. The instructions to firm members of the restrictions being placed on all firm members regarding the conflicting files carried with them the implicit notice of sanctions in the event the policy was not adhered.

The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial. The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access. The applicant had been prohibited in a 1998 order from removing the children from Saskatchewan without a court order, absent consent.HELD: 1)The issue of the payments was directed to trial and pre-trial conference to be held in January. 2)The mother was granted leave to move the children to Alberta.

HELD: The court directed the respondent to pay the $55k into court, freezing any funds to the applicant and freezing all money to the third parties. The status quo as access should also be maintained. The respondent was granted additional access to include Thursday or Monday, when the weekend falls on a statutory holiday and the applicant was prohibited from removing the children from Saskatchewan without court order, absent consent. The court ordered access to the respondent for the purpose provided the applicant paid $800 from the bank and $9,800 from her bank account. The Court directed the applicant to sell the home and to rent it to the appellant. The application was directed to proceed with the trial.

The third party was directed by the court to sell all of the property and to maintain the balance of the balance. The only condition for the applicant's possession and possession was that she pay all of her mortgage interest and any other costs associated with the sale of the home. The parties' joint possession and sale of property was reserved for the first and third parties and the court ordered the sale to the fourth party. The first respondent was to pick up and return the children to Saskatchewan on a reasonable income. The last respondent was ordered to pay all costs associated to the sale. The balance of her bank balance was reserved at the time of the application. The matrimonious allegation was proven to be the basis for the respondent and the application was dismissed.

HELD: The appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed. The judge made no error in ruling that all of the evidence from the prospective witnesses and transcripts was irrelevant as being unrelated to the charges and too remote in time. The appellant's state of mind was adequately established by his own evidence and the summation to the jury. The defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it. The sentence appeal was moot since it was limited to time served while awaiting trial.

He testified that he had been involved in several criminal complaints against the RCMP and these were being investigated. He also claimed that he was seriously assaulted and injured during one of these encounters. He alleged that he filed a number of formal complaints against them and that these were investigated. His evidence was that he became frustrated with and fearful of the RCMP, with the legal proceedings against him generally involving the RCMP (including the RCMP). He made the phone calls out of fear, anger and frustration. He testifies his purpose and intent in the messages overall was to be left alone; it was not his purpose to be threatening.

The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure. He argued all committee members, except the union representative, should be excluded by reason of bias.

It simply restated what was at issue and found to have had no effect. 2)There was no tenable basis for interfering.

The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below. 4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations. Proceedings should not be allowed to be fragmented and should be allowed to run their course so the court has a complete record from the tribunals below. Certiorari should not be granted where there is a right of appeal, except in exceptional circumstances.","The medical resident applied to have his suspension and probation as medical resident rescinded and to prohibit the Investigation Committee established to look into the matter from taking further action.

HELD: The petitioner was given judgment for $51,725.82 with taxable costs of the action payable within 3 months, failing which, the petitioner may apply for directions as to sale of the family property. The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm. The petitioner's claim for $1,000, borrowed from a friend to pay legal fees, was not considered a matrimonial debt.","The petitioner sought a distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. The parties cohabited for some 2½ years and then married seven years and had three children. After seven years of marriage, they separated in 2000. After 7 years and 3 children, they divorced in 2001. The petitioner carried on a mixed farming operation. The respondent owned a Case 800 tractor and a J.D. 400 mix mill. Prior to the marriage, he owned two cows and a cow. The father owned a J&W mix mill and sold the cows. The farm machinery was purchased prior to the separation and the petitioner received no income from the farm since the separation. HELD: 1) The farm equipment was family property. 2) The respondent sold his tractor and the sale proceeds were used to purchase the farm machinery. 3) The petitioner's automobile was exempt. 4) The $1,200 of farm machinery which was acquired prior to marriage was included in the distribution. 5) The father's tractor was exempt from the tax. 6) The Court accepted the claim for $16,500 but found that the father owned the tractor. The Court rejected the claim of $1 million. The court found that although the tractor was owned by the father prior to his marriage, the interest earned would not be exempt but the interest was not. The interest earned was exempt and the Court valued the tractor at $1.200. The $2,400 of farm equipment which was purchased by the respondent was exempt as was the $1k of farm furniture. The amount of farm expenses was also included. The farmer was awarded an exemption in respect to the tractor which was not included in this distribution. The farmers had no income and the farm equipment did not have any income from their farm. The husband was awarded a partial exemption in the amount of $2.5 million. 6. The value of the farm tractor was adjusted to reflect the value of farm land. 7) The farmer's tractor and farm machinery were exempt. 8) The tractor was not subject to tax. 9) The farmers' farm machinery consisted of two pieces of machinery. The first was a Case 970 tractor and two J. D. 400 mixes. The second was a tractor which had been acquired from an uncle's estate and was purchased many years ago. The tractor is not included. 10) The court accepted the $16k of tractor but did not accept the $2k of machinery which the father claimed was exempt"
c_2002skqb508.txt,"A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","The Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of food services. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties failed. The employer advised the Board that it was not prepared to make the agreement retroactive. The Board refused to sign a contract or implement it and sought clarification of the retroactivity of the wage rates. The employee sought an order setting aside the orders of the Board on the grounds that their decisions were patently unreasonable in that they could not afford the wage increases and further because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)The employer was a merchant. His products are priced in such a way that a wage hike, retroactive and rather substantial if viewed as a percentage would seem to be prejudicial. 2)The importance of a wage rise, retroactively, would seem counter productive. 3)The issue then becomes was patently unreasonably high. 4)The court found that the errors made here were so severe as to meet the standard of patently reasonable as defined by the courts."
c_2003skqb58.txt,"Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act. The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision. The Crown did not seek costs.","The plaintiffs applied for certification under The Class Actions Act on behalf of the following classes as set forth in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim: (a) Veterans Resident Class Any Indian person who, as defined by the Indian Act, is a resident of Canada who is a member of the proposed class.

The court found that there was no bar to the bringing of motions even at the pre-certification stage. The only issue at the certification stage was whether the plaintiffs were statute- barred from receiving the Survivors' Pensions that they sought. The issue was whether they were properly informed of the issues, the novelty of the cause of the action, and whether the suit was appropriately prosecuted as a class action."
c_2004skca153.txt,"The respondent was convicted after trial of fraud exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge granted him a conditional discharge with a probation order of 1 year and a requirement of 200 hours of community service work. He also made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The learned judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1) of the Code. The sentence imposed did not properly reflect the principle of deterrence or the gravity of the offence. 2) This was a serious fraud accomplished by what the judge called a rather intricate kiting system.","The Court granted a conditional discharge with a probation order of 1 year and a requirement of 200 hours of community service work and a 12 month conditional sentence was substituted in place of a 12-month conditional sentence. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The Provincial Court judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The sentence imposed did not reflect the gravity of the offence. The conditional discharge would do little to discourage others in the same situation from undertaking similar sorts of criminal activity. 2)The sentence imposed was not properly reflected the gravity and gravity of offence. A 12 month sentence was imposed with a 1 year probation order and a 200 hours community service requirement was substituted. The accused had no previous involvement with the system. 3)The conditional discharge was a serious fraud accomplished by virtue of what the Provincial Court Judge called 'a rather intricate kiting system'. The accused was 28 years old at the time of sentencing and had two young children. He was married and had a young child. He had no criminal record. The Provincial Court sentenced him to 12 months conditional discharge, 1 year, usual terms and conditions plus 200 hours in community service. He made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. 4)The accused had a history of financial fraud. He admitted to using a fraudulent bank account to pay off some creditors. He deposited the cheque into his CIBC Visa account and the next day withdrew the $11,000 in cash. About five days later, he repeated the same process, this time depositing and withdrawing $13,000 and withdrawing the $24000. CIBC issued a restitution judgment against him for $24.000. 5)The Court prescribed the compulsory conditions set out in s742.3(1) of The Criminal Code and further condition that the accused perform 200 hours on community service and that he was fined $2400 for any such work performed to date pursuant to the probation order made by the sentencing judge. In addition, the accused was ordered to perform 200 hour of community work."
c_2005skqb166.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused. As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). An initial question was whether the trial judge's decision quoted above reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for impaired driving. HELD: The entry of a judicial stay on the.08 charge was not used to avoid a multiple conviction issue. Volume of consumption falls within the provisions of s.253. The mechanism for doing so is the entering of a judge's reading on the charge that is less serious when convicting of the more serious. However, the trial court cannot use the reading to come to conclusion as to what quantity of alcohol was consumed or what effect, vis-à-vis impairment, such consumption of alcohol had on the particular accused. The Court noted that the accused's unsteadiness could have been a function of the hurt ankle. The entry was not a use of the judicial stay to avoid the multiple conviction issues. The use of judicial stay is to prevent vexatiousness and additional punishment that would otherwise result. The reason behind the use of s253(a), the mechanism for the entering and the leaving of a s. 253(b)(a) charge is to avoid conviction and punishment for more serious offences by pleading guilty to or being convicted of less serious offence. The trial judge concluded that the erratic driving pattern may well have been combination of alcohol and a very hurting ankle but certainly some of the driving was result of his impairment. The judge accepted that the unsteady could have a function for the hurt knee. The admission of the injured ankle could have had a function as a function the hurt foot. The decision to enter a judicial stayed on the impaired driving charge was in no way used to resolve the impaired driver issue. The judicial stay was not to avoid an error in law."
c_2005skqb450.txt,"The petitioner seeks an order for ongoing child support based on the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The respondent seeks an order that his child support obligations for their child ended July 2004 because their child ceased to be a person within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act as he was not, by reason of the pursuit of reasonable education, unable to withdraw from his mother's charge. HELD: 1) The child completed grade 12 in 2004 having turned 18 in February. He returned to high school in the fall of 2004. He worked at McDonald's during that year and lived with his mother. Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media. He is still under his mother's charge. She provides him with room and board. He is only 19 years old. He has been pursuing his education. The fact that he changed his course of study does not disentitle him to consideration for support. He is a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Act. This will continue until March 2006 when he has completed his current course of study. 2) The respondent's income fluctuates. It is appropriate to take an average of the last 3 years to determine his income.  3) Some attention must be paid to the financial ability of each parent to contribute. After deducting the table amount, the respondent would have a gross annual income of $19,781.52. On that basis the court was not prepared, even in the face of some shortfall for the child, to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts. The guideline amount is the appropriate amount to be paid until the end of this year's study.","HELD: The court found that the respondent was a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997 and that he had had that status on a continuing basis to the present time. The respondent was ordered to pay $181 per month for maintenance of the child, born February 1986, retroactive to October 2003. The amount of support was reduced to $181. The court ordered that the child's monthly child support payments cease effective July 2004 and that the Guideline amount be paid until the end of this year's study on March 13, 2006."
c_2006nssc132.txt,"When the trustee attended at the premises of the bankrupt, he found the bankrupt's inventory being loaded into a van by the landlord; after obtaining a consent order which allowed it to take possession of the assets for the purposes of compiling an inventory, the trustee brought an application for summary judgment against the landlord. Application for summary judgment granted. The evidence showed that only an offer to lease had been made, with no lease agreement ever having actually been signed, and that the individual with whom the landlord had dealt was only intended to be a guarantor and never a tenant.","The plaintiff retained the defendant as a contractual agent to value and liquidate the assets of the defendant's creditors pursuant to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The plaintiff found that the inventory was being loaded into a van and he was unable to gain possession of the assets. The defendant refused to turn over the inventory and an application was made for an interim injunction. The court found that although the plaintiff was only a guarantor, he was only acting as a tenant and had never intended to be a tenant. The evidence advanced by the defendant was overwhelming that the basic facts required to show consensus on the fundamentals of lease do not exist. The mere statement by the plaintiff that he was given the exclusive entitlement to receive reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements directly associated with removal and relocation of the premises did not constitute credibility in reaching the conclusion that the fundamentals were not advanced by County Realty."
c_2011nssc20.txt,"The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson. They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","The defendant GMCL moved for summary judgment on evidence to dismiss the claims made by two of the plaintiffs, Steven and Jody, alleging that the motor vehicle accident which occurred on October 1998 was caused by an inherent defect in the design and manufacture of the vehicle being driven by the other plaintiff. The plaintiff, the other defendant, was paid damages for the injuries sustained as a result of the accident. The two plaintiffs now claim damages for injuries they sustained as result of GMCL's careless and negligent actions in the manufacture of vehicle involved. The plaintiffs now allege damages for their injuries they suffered as a consequence of the motor car accident which they allege was caused as a direct result of a careless and negligence actions of GML in the designer and manufacture. The defendants claim damages against the other plaintiffs for the same accident. HELD: The motion for summary judgement was granted and the claims of both Steven and Johansson were dismissed. 1)Both conditions were satisfied and the parties were encouraged to try to reach agreement on costs. To allow their action to proceed would be an abuse of this Court's process. 2)The plaintiff had passed the initial hurdle leaving it to the other two plaintiffs to establish, on the facts that are not in dispute, that their claim had a real chance of success. The motion was granted. 3)The parties were to file a statement of claim for damages. The parties had not established a genuine issue for trial and the plaintiff had failed to establish a genuine one. 4)The defendants had not shown that there was a genuine problem of material fact requiring trial. The release was given to Citadel General Assurance Company (Citadel) and the plaintiffs were to provide evidence in favour of the plaintiff on the basis of the alleged manufacturing defect. The releases were given to the plaintiff and the defendant. The defendant was not party to the agreement nor was there an intention on their part to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on the contractual provision. The activities performed by the third parties seeking to depend on the contract were not known at the time the releases were signed. The actions performed by third parties were not part of the contract and could not be determined by reference to the intentions of the parties. The Court found that the defendants had failed in demonstrating that there is no genuine issue of material truth requiring trial and dismissed the claim."
c_2013skpc37.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08. The accused was permitted to use his cell phone on the way to the RCMP detachment to call his wife in Calgary and request help in finding a lawyer. He did not receive a call back from his wife. The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available. The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid. After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.' The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value. The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call. The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape. The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio. The video was taped over every 60 days and had been destroyed before it was requested by defence counsel. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. Even though the accused's cell phone was taken from him before he received a call back from his wife, it is clear that the accused made a conscious decision to call Legal Aid, and by implication, did not wish to pursue the first course of action. There was no obligation on the part of the RCMP to provide the accused with a Prosper warning. The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult with another lawyer. The officer was justified in assuming that the accused was satisfied with the legal advice he had received. The Crown stayed the impaired driving count prior to the conclusion of the trial. The videotape evidence was not relevant to the .08 offence because all observations were made at roadside. The video would not have shown anything of relevance to the charge. There is no breach of the accused's rights under s. 7. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted into evidence and the accused was convicted of the .08 charge.","The accused was stopped by an RCMP officer shortly after driving away from a bar/restaurant. The accused blew a test on the approved screening device and was taken to the detachment where samples of breath were obtained. The officer took the accused's cell phone and left it at the detachment. HELD: There was no breach of the accused’s right to counsel. 1)The removal of the cell phone does give some pause for thought in that the accused had initiated a procedure for obtaining legal advice which clearly could not be pursued once his cell phone was taken away. However, it is clear from the evidence that the defendant made a conscious decision to consult with Legal Aid and, by implication, did not wish to pursue his first course of action. 2)The destruction of video evidence does give pause for some pause in that, while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol, he did not initiate a procedure to obtain legal advice that clearly could be pursued upon his cellphone was taken. 3)The accused”s right of counsel was not breached. 4)The Court was not satisfied that the evidence was relevant to the accused. The removal of his cell was a pause for pause for the thought in the accused making a conscious choice to consult and, therefore, did do not constitute a breach of his right to a counsel. 5)The evidence was not destroyed. 6)The court was not able to find any relevance to the evidence. 7)The absence of the evidence did not have any effect on the accused and, in any event, the Court was unable to find a relevance to his evidence. 8)The loss of video was not an issue in this case. 9)The presence of the video evidence did have an effect on this case and could have been used to assist the accused in his defence. 10)The use of video to assist with the defence was not a factor."
c_2016skqb269.txt,"HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","The accused was charged under the Canada Labour Code with failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee by failing to instruct him on how to unplug a receiving pit. The accused was also charged with failing in its duty to ensure that the employee's health and well-being were protected. HELD: The accused is guilty of failing to provide proper training and supervision to the employee and failing to show due care and diligence to the employer. The court found that the accused did not have the proper training or supervision to ensure its safety. The Court found that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing not to ensure employee health and health. The evidence of the accused's failure to instruct the employee on how not to un-plug a moving pit of grain elevator was not accepted. The mass of material emphasized the dangers, and the importance of following the safety procedures, rather than burying them. The fact that the worker suffered serious injury at work is evidence that the Crown has accurately related what occurred and was proven. The Crown does not accept the Crown's position that proof that a worker's health or death is necessarily a proof of the act of failing the employee."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","The accused was convicted of dangerous driving and assault. The trial judge found that the accused intentionally drove in a manner which he knew created a danger for others, and drove in such a manner that she was forced to the side of the road to avoid an accident. The accused appealed his conviction on dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal from the dangerous driving conviction must be dismissed. The evidence was nonetheless reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge's decision. 1)The trial judge made no error on the de minimis issue. There was nothing in the transcript which suggested the trial Judge took a zero tolerance approach in rendering her decision. There is nothing in her decision that suggests the trial judges took a negative approach in making her decision; there is nothing that suggests she took a different approach in the manner in which the appellant drove. 2)The evidence was clearly supported by the evidence. The Court was entitled to re-weigh the evidence and to substitute my own opinion for that of the trial court judge."

For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","The parties entered into a separation agreement which provided for the maintenance of their matrimonial home and matrimony assets. The husband argued that the agreement was unconscionable, unduly harsh or fraudulent and that it was an extremely fair and indeed an unequal division in her favor.

The applicant was given written notice of the substance of both allegations according to the disciplinary procedure set out in the regulations made pursuant to the Police Act, but in the space provided for the citation the notice cited only the regulation which dealt with the offense of being discourteous. A hearing before an inspector of the Police Department resulted in the applicant being found guilty of the offense of lying.

The plaintiff alleged the contract price was in error and sought rectification of the contract. The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had. HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed. 1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted. He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest.

At issue was were whether the arbitrator applied the correct measure of damages and whether there was any evidence to support the findings of fact. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed. The respondent's application for enforcement of the award was granted without costs. 1)The issues were questions of fact not law. The errors complained of were the same questions referred to the arbitrator for determination. Adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' did not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law. The wording on the second issue was changed slightly to read 'in his calculation as to damages awarded for increased costs of winter construction'. There was some evidence upon which the arbitrator could make a finding of fact. 2)As none of the bars set out in the Act applied the court was required by s50(3) to give judgment enforcing the award.  3)The application for costs on a solicitor and client basis was denied.

d_1997canlii11439.txt,"The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The petitioner sought an order under The Dependents' Relief Act (DRI) varying child maintenance from $150 per child to $1,245 per month for the two children. The executors did not oppose the application under the Dependents', Relief Act but put in place the Estate's ability to support that level of support. HELD: The maintenance was to be paid monthly for the first two years of the children. 1)The petitioner had no personal effects. The term 'personal effects' does not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the business oroperations of the farm. 2)The court found that the phrase'reasonable provision' in s.9 of the Dependent's Relief Act was no longer defined as 'that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator'. The term was given to the oldest child as if each child weredesignated in the will as having an equal share of the estate. 3)The term 'physical chattels' had some personal connection with the testor such as articles of personal or domestic use or ornaments, clothing, furniture or other items related to a business or operation of the Farm.  4)The Court held that the term 'Personal effects' did not include anything having some connection with either the deceased's level of income, his or her personal use or the farm machinery or equipment or his or his personal or other interests related to his or the business andoperations the farm or his farm."

The mother moved with the daughter to British Columbia in 1997. The parties did not agree upon ongoing access.

It was important that he be reintroduced to his 10 year old daughter in a gradual and consistent fashion. He was granted access intitially for three and four hours in both provinces, then two days at the father's parent's home including overnight access and two days in the summer in British Columbia. Weekly telephone access was to continue each Sunday evening. Access was to be reviewed in the fall of 1998.","FIAT. A 10 year old was born as a result of the parents' separation. The parties agreed that it was in the best interests of the child that the Father and the child continue to have contact and access with each other and that the father continue to pay maintenance regardless of the marriage of the Father or Mother to someone other than the Father. HELD: 1)The father was to have access to his 10 year-old daughter in a gradual and consistent fashion. 2)The weekly telephone access was to continue each weekday for a period of four hours or so for two days in the months of March or April and two days for two weeks in the years of June and May 1998 at Nelson. 3)The annual overnight telephone access would continue each Sunday evening and such other times during the week that do not interfere with the father's activities. 4)The relationship between the parties was tumultuous. The father argued that he should be granted access every second weekend, every second Christmas and Easter and two weeks during the summer, all unsupervised. The two days before the end of June 1998 were to take place at the father and wife's farm residence including overnight access."

The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury. Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial.

d_2005skca149.txt,"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his sentence when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of his order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. The Crown appealed her decision and argued that, on a proper reading of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time between the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. HELD: Appeal allowed. The Youth Court judge found that the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. The youth appealed her order.  1) The Youth court judge interpreted the Youth Court decision as meaning the sentence had remained on the current course while he had been at large. The sentence continued to be run while the respondent remained at large, with the result that the sentence was ended prior to the matter coming before her for disposition. The Court concluded that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and community supervision order because the sentence did not run until he was arrested. 2) The Crown appeals her decision. It is important to note that s. 102(2) of the YCJA is a reference to s. 107. It incorporates the procedure applicable to s102(2). The Youth Courts judge reviewed s. 106(1) of s. 103 and found that no Action was required. The decision by the Youth court in relation to s103 of the Code is not straightforward. The court focused unduly on the provincial director's lack of authority to'suspend' community supervision under s102 and the contrast in this regard with the power of the director under s106 to suspend conditional supervision. The issue is whether the sentence is deemed not guilty of the breach of community supervision as it is already expired and, until the young person is apprehended, he or she is deemed to be not to serve the youth sentence the young is serving. The only way to do so is to cancel the suspension of the conditional supervision and refer the matter to the Youth Justice Court for review under s103. The appeal is allowed.  3) The Court reviewed s102 of the Act and found no change in the wording of s102. The purpose of the youth court decision is based in the concept of the suspension and community monitoring of s103 and the relationship between the concept and the power to suspend. The issues are: 1) There is a distinction between custody and conditional supervision orders on the"

Although the applicant has another avenue of appeal available to him within the workers' compensation system, he takes the position that the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction, so that there is no proper decision from which to appeal, leaving him with an application for judicial review as his only remedy. HELD: Whether or not the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction and consequently are a nullity, the applicant has an adequate alternative remedy available to him. No special circumstances that might justify judicial intervention at this time have been presented.

d_2006nssc26.txt,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.",The plaintiffs were in a motor vehicle accident. The defendant was operating a police vehicle. The plaintiffs were at a bar celebrating the occasion. The plaintiff was driving directly through the intersection on a green light. The defendants claimed the headlights were not in operation when it approached the intersection and that the plaintiff was contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 a.m. The trial judge found that up to the time of the motor vehicle collision the headlights had been in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle. HELD: The plaintiffs claim the defendants were negligent in operating the police vehicle and that Ms. Hawes is contributory to the accident. 1) The evidence of the lay witnesses and the evidence of a police officer was not admissible. 2) The plaintiff did not see the police car approaching the intersection. The evidence from the police officer did not establish that the police vehicles were in operation at the time the accident occurred. The Court found that the plaintiffs were not negligent in failing to observe the police cars approaching the accident scene. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to establish that Ms.'s headlights were in place when the accident took place. The only evidence that the defendant was qualified to express his opinion was that of the witness. 3) The Court permitted further evidence from a witness but found that it was not presented evidence which established that the officer was qualified.
d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of certiorari relating to the issuance of a search warrant. The information to be obtained was obtained through an information to obtain a search and seizure of the applicant's accounting records. The documents were found at the applicant’s place of business, located in his and Ms. Taylor’ s residence and in any storage facilities. The applicant”s employment records were also seized. The affidavit contained incomplete and misleading information. The judge indicated that he would be more comfortable omitting information that he now knew to be erroneous. The court concluded that the judge erred in concluding that the necessary grounds existed for the search. The evidence supports the inference that the officer would not have pursued a warrant without the information obtained through the information."
d_2007nspc68.txt,"The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code; and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration of his blood exceeded eighty milligrams in one hundred milliliters of blood contrary to the Criminal code. HELD: The accused was not guilty of either offence. The Court found that the accused's act in the manner in which he did so constituted a reasonable limit on the risk of the accused changing his mind. The accused's actions involved the use of the car's equipment to turn the key in the ignition to the accessories position and to play music on the stereo. The defendant's act was to turn on the engine and to have the car put in first gear and the engine was not running. The court concluded that there was little danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or becoming a danger to the public. The only issue and the one on which requested briefs from the Crown and Defence was whether or not the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was in care or control of his motor vehicle at the relevant time. The defence argued that the risk assessment, as an element of care and control, should include an assessment of the risk that the vehicle could be set in a motion unintentionally, thereby creating danger to public. HOLD: The Court concluded that the Court found no evidence that the Crown rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1)(a) and that there had been little, if any, danger of this offence occurring. The evidence from the accused’s acts was corroborated by the testimony of another witness who testified that the same witness had also testified that he had driven his car to pick up eight cans of beer, then drove to the Car Bright car wash, where he parked and picked up eight more cans of alcohol. The vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building; the parking brake was engaged; the vehicle was in first and the transmission was not engaged. The parking brake activated and the vehicle entered first gear. The engine was running and the parking was not turning. The officer read the breath demand and the breath sample and the accused said he was too drunk to drive.

d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.",HELD: The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. The Ministry requested a six-month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. HELD: HELD. The children were returned to the father. The father was to continue living with the mother and provide support and counselling. The mother was to take anger management courses and take anger-management courses. The court reviewed the evidence and found that the father was not seeking a return of the children to her directly but supported the position of the father who asked that the children be returned to him in his care.
d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.",The plaintiff brought a motion to dismiss the claim against the defendant for failing to produce a proper representative plaintiff. The motion sought to have the defendant deliver notice to class members who booked a vacation through Red Seal to stay at resort in Cuba between November 2004 and February 2005. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had not settled with it and therefore could not be viable parties to the action. The plaintiff sought to compel the defendant to provide notice to all persons who had booked with Red Seal during the purposed class. The application was dismissed. The court found that the wording of s. 14 of the Class Actions Act created a concern about the suspension of time limitations. The Court dismissed the application for examination on the basis that the defendant could not examine the plaintiff.
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. The respondent was 60 years old and the appellant was 53. The parties had separated in 2003 after 24 years of marriage following two years of cohabitation. The appellant was 60 and the respondent was 53 and had two adult children. The mother had worked for Safeway but took a buyout of her pension and job in exchange for $35,000. The father was receiving social assistance in the amount of $14,000 annually. The wife was receiving support retroactive to May 2007. The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining the mother on the basis that she was over 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student. The court found that the respondent had not engaged in gainful employment at all. The husband was receiving spousals for the same reasons.

At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order. If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3).

He had been convicted of more than one 'designated offence' under s485.011(a) of s485 and where an offender is convicted of a designated offence, s.485.012 requires the sentencing to order the offender to comply.

In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations.

Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with possession of child pornography. The accused was a member of the RCMP's Internet Child Exploitation Unit. The RCMP had been investigating the accused for several years and had found that the accused had access to child pornography on his computer. The search warrant was issued and the accused was detained. The first two files being flagged by CPS were all from the same client and were all accessed from the Internet. The second file was from the internet and was stored on a server at the same location. The third file was a laptop computer and was accessed from a different physical location. During the course of his investigation, the accused began to suspect that the Internet was being used to distribute child pornography and that the internet was being monitored by the Internet service provider. The Internet was a common source of child porn and the Court was also aware that the RCMP had access. The Court was not satisfied with the evidence and the evidence was dismissed. The court was not convinced that the officer who was monitoring the Internet for the accused could have access to the Internet and that he was being watched by the Court. The evidence was that the police officer who had access was being followed by the accused and the Internet Explorer program that was used to monitor the Internet, and the internet access was also being monitored. The officer testified that he had no idea that the information was being shared between the Internet users. The only thing that could be found was that there was a computer that could have been used to direct the Internet traffic. The police officer testified to the Court that he could have seen the Internet being used by the internet to distribute pornography. He testified that the computer was being controlled by the ICE program and that it was being operated by the officer. The ICE officer testified about the Internet connection between the internet connection and the computer and that there were multiple ways to access the Internet including by using a remote computer. He also testified that there is a computer called a'remote computer' that can be used to access files. The internet connection is a bridge between two networks. The computer is being used as a bridge and the user is accessing the same Internet address. The user is able to access all of the Internet through the remote computer and the physical address of the computer is the physical MAC address.

The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers.

The court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the first sample was obtained within two hours of the accident. The defence had not proven beyond areasonable doubt that there was a breach of fundamental justice. The evidence of the two Crown civilian witnesses was so reprehensible that it must be denounced regardless of the effect on the testimony at trial. The facts of the conversation were not supported by the evidence of either the Crown or the defence witnesses. The officer who testified testified that he was not aware of the accused’s driving and that he had not seen the accused for more than 15 minutes. The police officer testified that she was in the intersection with the accused and that she had been walking towards the intersection when she saw the accused vehicle. The driver of the Sunfire testified that the defendant was driving and she was not asked how long she had walked towards the accident site. The two civilian witnesses testified that they had been in the area for about 30 minutes. They testified that there were two other vehicles that were stopped at the intersection. The first witness testified that it was at the time of the collision and that the second witness testified to being in the vicinity of the intersection and that they were both in the same vehicle.

e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.",HELD: The appeal was granted. The court found that the City had met its duty to accommodate and that the Court had not erred in finding that the city was responsible for the discrimination against the plaintiff. The Court found that there was no inherent jurisdiction in any appeal court. The plaintiff had been a casual employee for 16 years and had been employed by the City for 16. His only claim to employment was as a truck driver. He had been denied permanent employment and was kept on casual status for 15 years. He appealed. Appeal allowed.

e_2005nssc340.txt,"The husband applied to vary a corollary relief judgment in order to either terminate spousal support or decrease it with a fixed date for termination. The parties were married for twelve years and had been divorced for seven years. The husband had been paying $600 per month in spousal support since the divorce and had recently retired from the military; his current income was now primarily derived from his pension. The wife had serious long-term mental illness and was unable to manage employment. The parties' teenage son was now solely in the husband's care. Spousal support reduced to $300 per month payable for a further three years at which point it will terminate. Notwithstanding the wife's disability, the husband's obligation to her should not extend beyond the length of their marriage; although the wife might not be able to become totally self-sufficient, there was no evidence that she was unable to contribute anything at all towards her own support.","The father applied to vary a corollary relief judgment, varied in 1998 and 2003, and for a decrease in spousal support in 2005. He sought a termination of spousa support or alternatively a decrease of support with a fixed date for termination. The wife was 46 years of age and had a child with a disability. The father was retired and had been the sole provider for the child since 1996. The mother was 42 years of old and had recently suffered from serious mental illness. The court found that there had been a change in circumstances as required by the Divorce Act before variation could be considered. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The court found the applicant was entitled and was entitled by virtue of his continuing inability to become self-sufficient. The Court found that the wife's circumstances were the same as they were at the time of the hearing. 2)The father was entitled to spousic and child support for the duration of the marriage. The application to vary was not time-limited and the father was to pay monthly maintenance of $300. The respondent converted her equalized property into income. 3)The Court found the wife was economically disadvantaged by the breakdown of the relationship. She was relatively young and there was nothing to suggest that she was unable to earn some income. 4)The applicant was awarded spousals for maintenance of approximately $400 per month for five years. 5)The wife was to receive support for 10 years (but total of 11 years) in a 13 year relationship where the recipient was unable or unwilling to work. The applicant was to have a child under the agreed upon access regime. She would require more money to survive. She should not have to turn to the state unless absolutely necessary. The amount of support was reduced to $400. The husband was to be awarded spouses of support for 12 years. 6)The respondent was to get spousas for 10 and 12 years in a 12 year relationship with a flat rate of $400 for each year. The order for spouss for maintenance was indefinite. 7)The husband was awarded $400 monthly spousousal for 10 year. 8)The mother was to take spouses for 12 and 13 years. 9)The application to terminate spousAL support was to vary after nine years of continuous support.  10)The amount of spouse support was increased.

e_2006skca55.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the court accepting fresh evidence. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed. There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed. 1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission. 2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us. All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay. Any evidence sought to be adduced under the discretion of what is now s. 683 of the Code must be admissible evidence. With respect to the evidence of Ms. Brinkman, she does not swear that Ms. Bodkin was selling methamphetamine at the relevant time. 3) With respect to due diligence, it must be noted that the appellant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who represents him before this court. The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward. If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems. 4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered.",The appellant appeals his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the Court accepting fresh evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Court found that the appellant did not follow the procedure outlined by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Lévesque in making this fresh evidence application. 2) The evidence of the appellant was not new. The Court had to determine whether the drugs seized at the premises being rented by one of the accused and whether the methamphetamine in the basement belonged to the appellant. 3) The appellant did nothing to change her position on the issue of whether the evidence of her friend was relevant. 4) The Crown's evidence of a 'free and open' person who was living in the home at the time of the discovery of the methamphetamine was not supported by fresh evidence and the appellant's actions were not reasonably foreseeable. 5) The application to adduce fresh evidence was dismissed. The appellant had not followed the procedure described by the Court in RCL. The Crown had proven each and every essential ingredient of the charge to my satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt and therefore found the appellant guilty as charged on that count.
e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","HELD: The court found that the most representative and fairest method of determining this self-employed father's income was three-year average under the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The court also found that if the respondent had overpaid child maintenance to this date, he may offset the overpayment against future maintenance payments but only to the extent of $50 per month so that the maintenance actually paid will not drop below $518 per month until the overpay has been extinguished."

e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The chambers judge had the necessary evidence to make his decision whether all, some, or none of the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. The appellant had failed to consider and apply the definition of'special and extraordinary expenses' in s.7(1).1. The appeal did not succeed on appeal. The Chambers judge did not make a palpable and overriding error nor did he err in law and his conclusion was supported by the evidence before him."
e_2008skpc108.txt,"The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home. They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.","The plaintiff and his wife sought to have the defendant's construction materials delivered to their home. The defendant refused to provide the materials and the plaintiffs sued for $3,604.13. The plaintiff brought a counterclaim against the defendant for $2,200. The defendants sued for the return of the deposit. The contract was frustrated by the unforseen soil conditions which prevented the drilling of ten foot depth pile holes for concrete piles. The plaintiffs sued the defendant, claiming that the defendant had misappropriated the funds and that the contract was not reasonably forseeable. The court found that the plaintiff should bear 65% of the loss and the plaintiff 35% of loss. The Court found that a just and reasonable resolution demanded that the value of the expenses lost due to frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties in a 65/35 ratio. The breach of contract was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. The damages were assessed against the plaintiff. The Plaintiff brought a countersuit against the defendants for $1,000 of the $2 million in damages. The Defendant filed a counter-claim and a counter claim against the plaintiffs for $4,000. The Defendants sued for a balance of $3.6 million. The parties were in the business of constructing sunrooms and the contract as a result was frustrated. The contractual obligation was beyond repair and the defendant was unable to meet the obligations. The corporation was able to write off the loss over the course of time. The supervening event was beyond control of the parties and caused a significant amount of change in original obligation. The contracting contract was frustrating. The fact that the plaintiffs had been in the construction business for over two years and had not been able to mitigate their losses by salvaging materials from the Ens' and the defendants' construction experience was beyond their control. The failure of the defendant to provide materials to the plaintiff was beyond its control."

The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent.

e_2012skpc43.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to ss. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with operating while his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to s. 255 and 253 of the Code. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The Court held that the accused's Charter rights were violated. The Court found that the Court could not conclude that the officer had reasonable grounds for making the demand. The court also held that there was no breach of s. 8 or s. 9 of the Charter and the evidence was not admissible. The officer did have reasonable ground to arrest the accused for impaired driving and that the grounds to apply the demand were objectively sustainable. The grounds upon which the demand was based cannot be said to be objectively reasonable, the detention was arbitrary, the breath samples unlawfully seized and the case law was violated. Therefore, the Court held the admission of the evidence in the face of a Charter breach was not appropriate."

This is a defamation action and the amendment would add that the words spoken by the defendant were true and that the alleged defamation was justified in law. The action relates to statements made about the plaintiff's failure to properly read an X-ray and his failure to pass certain certification exams and that health officials knew that he should not be performing the work he was doing. There is another defamation action, described in this judgment as the College Action. The defendant applied pursuant to Rule 41(2) that his action and the College Action be tried together because there are common issues of fact between the two, albeit different actions.  Trying them together would be in the interests of judicial economy and avoid the possibility of conflicting findings. HELD: The Court ordered that the two actions be tried one immediately after the other in the manner determined by the trial judge and that the defendant be given leave to amend his Statement of Defence.","FIAT. The defendant applied pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 41(2) for an order that this action and Tsatsi v. College of Physicians and Surgeons, Don McMorris and The Sunrise Health Region, be tried together. The statements made by the defendant were made by him on June 1, 2009. The statement alleged that the plaintiff has failed certification exams and health officials knew the plaintiff should not be doing the work he was doing. The College Action is also a defamation action. HELD: An order pursuant to Rule 41 of the Queen's B Bench Rules for an ordered that the actions be tried one after the other, with the College Action proceeding first, and that the evidence in the College action be evidence in this action. 1) This is a defamation suit based on statements that the defendant alleges were made on June 2009. There are common issues of fact between the two actions at issue. The Statements made specific allegations about the plaintiff's failure to properly read an x-ray, and also alleged that health officials had knowledge the plaintiff had failed certification examinations and that health health officials were aware the plaintiff was not doing the job he was. 2) The College action is also an action. 3) The Court reviewed the issues of law and judicial economy and found that the Court was not satisfied that Rule 41 was appropriate. Rule 41 is a discretionary rule which is resorted to and utilized when there are sound reasons of judicial economy, or avoidance of disparate rulings arising out of the same facts or law, to justify the actions being tried at the same time. The Court noted that there are common questions of fact, but not determinative, in the interests of judicial economies and justice that are the underpinning for joinder of actions. The order in which the trials are conducted, the use of evidence from one action in the other and any other matters that must be addressed are better left for determination by the trial judge."
e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. They attended a French language school for the children. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children's provisional approval to attend a French school would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless children applied for an interlocutory injunction, alleging that the school had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. The Court granted the family provisional permission to attend the school. The children commenced this action against the defendant and then applied for a permanent injunction that would order the school to grant ongoing permission to the Lawlessness family to attend. The court found that the CÉF had failed to meet its commitments to the children and that the family was unable to meet their educational needs. The family was also found to be in breach of the school's obligations under s. 42.1 of The Education Act. The CÉf was found to have failed to provide adequate support to the family and to have been negligent in failing to provide proper educational support to their children. The Family was found guilty of discrimination and the Court found that it was in the best interests of the children to continue attending the school and that it would be in the children’s best interests to continue to attend school."

The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence. There was no genuine issue requiring a trial.

The amended claim seeks to recover damages on behalf of those who purchased the defendants' 'Low Sodium' beverages but ultimately received beverages which were no lower or not appreciably lower in sodium than other, non-Low Sodium beverages. The plaintiff also asserts that the defendants made deceptive and misleading advertisement and representation by selling 'Low the Low Sodium' Beverages which the Defendants knew or should have known were no higher or appreciably low in sodium but were misleading to consumers. The Court reviewed the plaintiff's affidavit and found that the plaintiff had not specifically directed her mind in meaningful fashion to the claim, the claim as a class as whole, and the expert evidence of the plaintiffs in uncontroverted. The court found that there was no genuine issue for trial and that the plaintiffs had simply misconstrued their own pleadings and seized upon what they believed was an admission that the 'low sodium' products were 'low-sodium' versus the other in its category and misled consumers into purchasing their product based on this claim. The only issue requiring trial is whether the defendants misled consumers. HELD: The Court was satisfied that the application for summary judgment was appropriate. The application for a summary judgment application was dismissed. The judge was satisfied in following the judicial authority and determining the defendants’ summary judgment request prior to having to decide the plaintiffs’ application for certification."
e_2015skqb412.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice. The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","The applicant applies pursuant to s. 67 of The Legal Profession Act for an assessment of all bills for legal services that Brabant and Company Law Office rendered to Cowessess within six years of the date of the application. The application proceeded on March 12, 2015. For the reasons that follow, I dismiss the application and dismiss the applications. HELD: The application is dismissed. The information put forward here on which to direct an assessment is much more specific is not fair. The applicant is not a party to a general or specific complaint. The amount of fees the accounting system suggests seems very significant so Brabants should have to explain the past six years. The evidence put forward by Cowessesses is not sufficient to warrant the extension of the time for an assessing. The applicants have not proven that the services they provided to Cowessesess are meaningful and that they are not being misconstrued. The court found that the application was not fair and that the information put forth by Cowessesesses should be much more detailed."
e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The Court granted the respondent interim primary residence and an equal division of family home and property. The Court found the petitioner's Federal Child Support Guidelines income to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal support in $5,250.00 per month. The court ordered the respondent to pay interim support in full and spousals in the amounts of $5.250 per month and ordered the matter to pre-trial conference."
