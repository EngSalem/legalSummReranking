Therefore, it is ordered that the petitioner shall parent Keandra each school day commencing after school recesses for the day until the respondent is finished her work and therefore able to pick Keandra up.
The petitioner and respondent shall split all school holidays and special occasions in a fair if not equal manner as they presently do by agreement.","The respondent filed an interlocutory notice, ex parte application, against the intended defendants, seeking an interim injunction.

Dexter Construction Company Ltd. 1999 NSCA 132] BETWEEN: LABOURERS’ INTERNATIONAL UNION OF NORTH AMERICA, LOCAL 1115 (hereinafter referred to as the “Union”) and Blaise MacDonald PERSONS UNNAMED for The Union Intended Defendant(s) and Eric Durnford for the respondent DEXTER CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LTD. Intended Plaintiff/ Respondent Application Heard: October 21, 1999 Decision Delivered: November 2, 1999 BEFORE THE HONOURABLE JUSTICE RONALD N. PUGSLEY IN CHAMBERS Pugsley, J.A. (In Chambers): [1] Labourers’ International Union of North America, Local 1115, (hereinafter called the Union) applies for leave to obtain intervener status as a party, or as amicus curiae, or alternatively as an intervener, and to bring an appeal from orders made on September 23 and October 1, 1999, by Justice Tidman of the Supreme Court, in proceedings brought by Dexter Construction Co. Limited (Dexter), Intended Plaintiff, against Persons Unnamed, Intended Defendant(s). [2] The leave to obtain intervener status as a party is made pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 5.02, and 5.04, and 8.01(1). The application to be joined as an amicus curiae, or friend of the court, is made pursuant to Rule 8.02. The application to be added as an intervener is made pursuant to Rule 62.35. [3] Application is also made for extensions of time and variation in the manner and time and place of service on Dexter, pursuant to Rules 3.03, 37.05, and 62.31. Background [4] On Wednesday, September 23, 1999, Dexter, the Intended Plaintiff, filed an interlocutory notice ex parte application against ""Persons Unnamed Intended Defendant(s)"", seeking an interim injunction to restrain the Intended, Defendant(s) ""and each of their servants, agents, representatives and employees, and any person or persons acting under the instructions of them, or any of them, and any person having notice of this order"", from picketing or otherwise impeding or preventing Dexter, its employees and suppliers, from entering premises located in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality where Dexter was carrying on work. [5] No other party was named as an Intended Defendant(s). [6] In support of the application, the affidavits of Kevin MacDonald, President of Dexter, and Daniel Clifton, General Superintendent, were filed. [7] An order ex parte was granted on September 23, 1999, by Justice Tidman of the Supreme Court. It provided, inter alia, that ""this matter be returnable on the 30th day of September, 1999 at 12:00 noon, at such time the Unnamed Defendant(s) shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard in relation to the continuation of this Injunction Order."" [8] am advised by counsel for the Union that he was instructed by his client, on Friday, September 24, 1999, of the existence of the ex parte order, copy which was apparently delivered to him on that day. Over the next few days, copies of one, or more, of the supporting affidavits were also obtained by him. [9] On Thursday, September 30, 1999, Dexter filed supplementary affidavit deposed by Mr. Clifton on the 29th of September. Dexter also filed memorandum in support of its submission for the continuation of the ex parte injunction. Mr. MacDonald, counsel for the Union, advised he was not aware of the existence of these documents before the hearing on September 30th. [10] On the return date, counsel for the Union was present in court for his client on an application to continue another unrelated injunction proceeding (Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Intended Plaintiffs v. Labourers’ International Union of North America, Local 1115 and Persons Unnamed, Intended Defendants, SN No. 111895, proceeding which was the subject of another Chambers application before me). [11] Upon counsel for Dexter requiring clarification of Mr. MacDonald's status respecting the Dexter application, the following exchange occurred: Mr. MacDonald: My Lord, am not here representing any unnamed persons, ...local 1115, who is client, client of mine, is not named in the application, as understand and I've got copies of it faxed to me from the Court.. can tell you this My Lord, and this is one of the things that concerns me and offer this as friend of the, friend of the Court. And, of course, in the interest of my client as well. And in the interest of the operating engineers in the I.B.E.W. who are not my clients. But it affects all of those. And that is one of the problems with respect to labor injunctions and the caveat provision in the Judicature Act to...the Court avoid them as, as much as possible. Certainly none without notice. The Court don't want to hear your argument on the issuance of the injunction. want to hear your response to Mr. Sampson's opposition to you having status before the Court. Mr. MacDonald .. do not represent any unnamed parties, have no idea who the unnamed persons are and if knew who they were it may well be that my client, [the Union] would instruct me to assist or defend them or whatever. But we have no idea who they are. The Court ...this is against unnamed persons, there is nothing anywhere in the material to indicate that the unnamed persons have anything to do with your client. And the action is not against your client. ... as far as the Court is aware there is no labor/management dispute. And in view of the fact that you had told the Court that you don't represent the unnamed, unnamed parties, the persons unnamed, as party to the action, then you have no status to appear before the Court, because your client is not party to the action. [12] No viva voce evidence was called by Dexter in support of its submission for the continuation of the injunction. Submissions were made to Justice Tidman by counsel for Dexter, as well as counsel for the Union. [13] On October 1, 1999, Justice Tidman issued an order substantially in the form of the order granted on September 23, with the following amendments: AND IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Intended Plaintiff shall file an Originating Notice and Statement of Claim upon further direction being given by this Honourable Court AND IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Intended Defendants are at liberty to make an Application to this Court to have hearing on this application by providing forty-eight (48) hours’ notice to the Intended Plaintiff of its intention to make such application; THIS ORDER is subject to and in no way restricts the lawful right of the Intended Defendants and its representatives and members and their lawful right solely to communicate and disseminate information to the public; THIS ORDER is to continue until further Order of this Honourable Court. [14] The Union has filed two affidavits in support of its position on the present applications, one by Bernie MacMaster, Secretary Treasurer and Dispatcher of Local 1115, deposed on October 8, 1999, and the other by Doug Serroul, Business Manager of Local 1115, deposed on October 12, 1999. [15] Mr. MacMaster deposes in part: 2. THAT attached to this my Affidavit as Exhibit ""A"", is true copy of draft of an application which LIUNA 1115 is making to the Construction Industry Panel of the Nova Scotia Labour Relations Board under the Nova Scotia TRADE UNION ACT. The said draft application is an application for successors rights. It is claim to successor rights by LIUNA 1115 for the balance of the work on the Provincial Highway #125 Twinning Project. The latter project was formally contracted to Municipal Ready Mix Ltd. and now the balance of or the last one-third (1/3 approximately) of the work is being performed by Dexter Construction Ltd. without compliance with the collective agreement which was in effect in operation for the first two thirds of the project. 3. THAT am informed by LIUNA 1115 solicitor, Blaise MacDonald, and believe him that there is an arguable issue that the matter put before the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on September 23rd, 1999, in the initial Ex-Parte Interim Application, and placed again on the return date of September 30th, 1999, was “labor-management dispute” within the meaning of s. 44 of the JUDICATURE ACT.. 4. THAT no notice of these September 23 and September 30th, 1999, proceedings, except copy of the September 23rd, 1999, Order of the Supreme Court, was served upon the LIUNAl 1115 up to the time of my swearing this Affidavit. 5. THAT members of LIUNA 1115, and members of other road building unions such as the International Union of Operating Engineers (“I.U.O.E.”) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers were employed on the road building project in question and would be, if successful at the Labour Relations Board, be employed there in the future until its completion. 7. THAT am told by Blaise MacDonald, solicitor for LIUNA 1115, and do verily believe him, that the transcript will reflect that he attempted without notice from the applicant, to make submissions to the Court and was not permitted to do so on September 30, 1999. [16] Doug Serroul deposes in part: 4. THAT have read the affidavit of Bernie MacMaster sworn the 8th day of October, A.D. 1999, and he is mistaken in that LIUNA 1115 was never formerly served with any Order, Notice or Affidavits in this proceeding Although copy of an order dated September 23rd, 1999, ... was served by fax upon LIUNA 1115 on the afternoon of September 24th, 1999. 5. THAT am told by Blaise MacDonald, .... and do verily believe him, that he obtained copies of documents from the file at the Prothonotary’s Office prior to the hearing on Thursday, the 30th day of September, 1999, but copies of an affidavit of Daniel Clifton, sworn September 30th, 1999, and letter to the Court from Dexter’s Solicitor, Robert Sampson, dated September 30th, 1999, were not made available to him prior to or during the Court Proceedings before Mr. Justice Gordon Tidman. 6. THAT instructed Blaise MacDonald, solicitor for LIUNA 1115, to attend the application on Thursday, the 30th day of September, 1999, and attempt to make representations to the Court that LIUNA 1115 and its members were in the midst of labour dispute with Dexter Construction Company Limited and its predecessor contractor on that project, Municipal Ready Mix Limited. 12. THAT LIUNA1115 instructed its Solicitor to attend because it was desirous of seeing the lawful rights protected for those who are members of LIUNA 1115 and who lost their employment, their opportunity for employment, all LIUNA 1115 members, and indeed any members who were in sympathy or empathy with the plight of Local 1115 and its members. 18. THAT LIUNA 1115 especially in the absence of any other party who oppose the intended Plaintiff, will instruct its Solicitor to make submissions to this Honourable Court, which include the following: (a) That there was denial of natural justice and fair hearing by the learned trial judge by allowing the intended Plaintiff to proceed against “Unnamed Persons”, as sole defendants, without further description, in the manner in which the learned Justice did, including purporting to hold an Inter Partes Interlocutory hearing in the manner in which it was noticed and held. (b) That there was denial of natural justice and fair hearing, as well as jurisdictional error, by the failure of the learned Trial Judge to hear the LIUNA 1115’s Solicitor on the arguable issue of the existence of “labour dispute” within the meaning of s. 44(1)(b) of the Judicature Act, RSNS, 1989, Ch. 240, as amended. (c) That the trial judge committed errors of law and jurisdiction when he permitted “Unnamed Persons”, simpliciter, without more, to be the defendants, indeed the sole defendants, in an interim and interlocutory proceeding. (d) That the learned trial judge erred in proceeding with an uncontested Interlocutory hearing continuing the injunction till trial, particularly in the circumstances of this case. (e) Whether other submissions may advance the interests of LIUNA 1115, its members and or oppose the position of the Intended Plaintiff after examining and studying the transcript and determining what occurred at all the proceedings before the learned Trial Judge and may allow for additional grounds. (f) THAT “Unnamed Persons”, without more, should rarely, if ever, be used as defendants, and rarely, if not never, be used as sole defendants. [19] THAT understand that there is no other opposition to the intended action by the Intended Plaintiff and would hope that LIUNA 1115’s submissions would be helpful to this Honourable Court. [17] No evidence was adduced that the Union was directly affected by the provisions of the order of October 1, 1999. [18] The grounds of the proposed appeal are stated as follows: 1. The Justice herein erred at law in that he denied the natural justice and fair hearing by: (a) By permitting the Intended Plaintiffs to proceed in an interlocutory proceeding against “Unnamed Persons” as the sole Defendant(s). (b) By failing to require notice in pleadings to be served in the usual manner, or through substituted service, upon unnamed persons. (c) By prohibiting and refusing submissions by the counsel for [the Union] that there was an arguable issue that there was “labour dispute” within the meaning of the Civil Procedure Rules and the Judicature Act, R.S.N.S., 1989, Ch. 240, as amended, s. 44(1)(b). (d) Wrongfully denying [the Union] to complete its submission before denying status. 2. THAT the Learned Justice erred in law by allowing the sole defendant(s) “Unnamed Persons” to stand as the sole defendant(s) in the proceeding, or purported proceeding. 3. THAT the learned Justice erred in law in any other way that may become apparent from examination of the transcript of these proceedings. 4. THAT the learned Justice erred in law in denying status to [the Union]. [19] The Union requests the judgment appealed from be varied: ...by deleting “Unnamed Persons” as defendants or intended defendants in these proceedings. [20] No one was served on behalf of the Intended Defendant(s), Persons Unnamed, and no one appeared on behalf of that Intended Defendant(s) at the hearing of these applications. [21] Dexter opposes all of the applications advanced by the Union. [22] An appeal to this Court may only be filed by party to proceeding, or by an intervener added pursuant to the Civil Procedure Rules, (see McMahon, J. A., sitting in Chambers, in Johnston et al v. Prince Edward Island [1989] 73 Nfld. PEI, 219 (C.A.)). The Union was not joined as a party by Dexter, and was not joined as a party or as an intervener by order of the Supreme Court. The Union, therefore, does not have the status to file an appeal, unless it is first joined in either of these two capacities as a result of the applications presently before me. [23] It is convenient to deal with these applications by first considering the Union’s request to be joined as an intervener, pursuant to Rule 62.35; secondly, as party or amicus curiae, pursuant to Rule 8; and finally as party pursuant to Rule 5. At the hearing of these applications, counsel for the Union advised that he would not make any oral submissions respecting the applicability of Rule 5.02, as he concluded the provisions of Rule 5.04 were more pertinent. [24] Justice Hallett, in 1874000 Nova Scotia Limited et al. v. Adams et al. (1996), 1996 CanLII 5243 (NS CA), 156 N.S.R. (2d) 208, determined that judge of this Court, sitting in Chambers: ...does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status as there is nothing in Rule 62 or any other Rule or enactment that authorizes such an application to be made to the Chambers judge rather than to the Court. (at p. 215) (See also Hallett, J.A. in Future Inns Canada Inc. v. Nova Scotia Labour Relations Board (1996), 1996 CanLII 5240 (NS CA), 154 N.S.R. (2d) 358). [25] Prior to the decision in Adams, applications for intervention at the appeal level, in civil cases, were made under Rule in combination with Rule 62.31(1). (See Arnoldin Construction and Forms Limited v. Alta Surety Company (unreported, C.A. No. 106122, filed October 31, 1994); Arrow Construction Products Ltd. v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General) (1996), 1996 CanLII 5589 (NS CA), 148 N.S.R. (2d) 392.) [26] The decision in Adams led to the introduction of new rule entitled “Intervention on Appeal” providing for intervention in civil appeals. The rule came into effect in June of 1997. It was made rule of this Court by virtue of the authority granted to the judges of the Court of Appeal by s. 46 of the Judicature Act, RSNS, 1989 C.240. It is the rule governing interventions to this Court by persons who are interested in an appeal. It is the rule that should govern the consideration of applications for intervention to this Court. [27] The new rule is significantly different from the provisions of Rule 8. [28] I am satisfied that the Union’s application to be joined as an intervener pursuant to Rule 62.35 should not be granted, as there is no appeal outstanding to this Court. [29] The provisions of Rule 62.35(1), in my opinion, make the existence of an appeal an imperative. The section reads: Any person, including any person who intervened in proceeding pursuant to Rule 8, interested in an appeal, may, by application in accordance with Rule 62.31 apply to Judge in Chambers for leave to intervene upon such terms and conditions as the Judge may determine. (emphasis added) [30] This interpretation is supported by an examination of the provisions of Rule 62.35(2) and (3). [31] Rule 62.35(2) requires an intervention to be filed and served within 20 days after the filing of the notice of appeal. [32] Rule 62.35(3) sets out the test to be employed by the Chambers judge requiring the applicant to describe its interest in the appeal, to identify the position to be taken by it, on the appeal, and finally, to set out the submissions it wishes to advance on the appeal, and the reasons for believing that the submissions would be useful to the Court and different from those of other parties. [33] would dismiss the application of the Union to be joined as an intervener pursuant to Rule 62.35. [34] The alternative application that the Union be joined as an amicus curiae, or an interested person, pursuant to Rule 8, should be dismissed as well, for the reasons set forth by Justice Hallett in Adams. [35] The Union also relies upon Rule 5.04(2). [36] Rule 5.04 under the heading “Misjoinder and Nonjoinder of Parties”, provides: (2) At any stage of proceeding the court may, on such terms as it thinks just and either of its own motion or on application, ... (b) order any person, who ought to have been joined as party or whose participation in the proceeding is necessary to ensure that all matters in the proceeding may be effectively adjudicated upon, be added as party [37] Counsel for the Union relies upon the definition of the word “court” as it is found in Rule 1.05(e)(i) as granting sufficient authority to Chambers judge in this Court to entertain an application for joinder under Rule 5.04(2). [38] Rule 1.05(e)(i) provides: Definitions 1.05 In these Rules, unless the context otherwise requires, (e) “court” means, (i) in the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, the court or judge or the judges thereof, whether sitting in court or Chambers. ... (emphasis added) [39] Rule 1.05(e)(i) was apparently not relied upon by counsel in Adams. [40] In my view, however, the limits on the jurisdiction of Chambers judge in this Court, as stipulated in Rule 62, constitute “context” restricting the broad definition expressed in Rule 1.05(e)(i). [41] would, accordingly, dismiss the application to join the Union pursuant to Rule 5.04 for the reasons expressed in Adams. [42] There are, however, additional cogent reasons that influence me to refuse the relief requested. [43] There are, to the best of my knowledge, no reported decisions in this jurisdiction dealing with an application by non-party to be added to proceeding as defendant, or as an Intended Defendant pursuant to Rule 5.04. The cases arising under this section are usually concerned with an application by an existing plaintiff to add an additional party as plaintiff, or as defendant (see P. A. Wournell Contracting Ltd. v. Allen (1980), 1980 CanLII 2720 (NS CA), 37 N.S.R. (2d) 125, (C.A.); Blair v. Alderney Consultants 1987 Ltd. (1995), 1995 CanLII 4154 (NS SC), 149 N.S.R. (2d) 184 (S.C.)). [44] Rule 5.04 was derived from Order 15, Rule of the Supreme Court Practice. While amendments were made to Rule in 1971, they are not relevant to the following comments which appear in the 1999 Supreme Court Practice. (Sweet Maxwell, Vol. I, 1998). The authors write in part: Generally in common law and Chancery matters plaintiff who conceives that he has cause of action against defendant is entitled to pursue his remedy against that defendant alone. He cannot be compelled to proceed against other persons whom he has no desire to sue (quoted with approval by Wynn-Parry J. in Dollfus Mieg, etc. v. Bank of England [1951] Ch. 33). Under this rule, however, person who is not party may be added as defendant against the wishes of the plaintiff either on the application of the defendant or on his own intervention, or in rare cases by the Court of its own motion. The jurisdiction of the court under this rule is entirely discretionary. (emphasis added) [45] Even if had jurisdiction to grant the relief requested under Rules 5.04, or Rule 8, would not exercise it in the circumstances of this case. [46] reach this decision because am of the view that the issues namely the joinder of the Union, and the continuation of the injunction order against the Intended Defendant(s), Persons Unnamed are issues that should be initiated at the level of the Supreme Court, and determined, by judge of that court. [47] Justice Tidman, in an interim application, determined on the basis of evidence adduced by affidavit, to continue an injunction “until further order of the Court”. The appropriate forum to consider the further continuation of that order is the Supreme Court. [48] The Union still has an opportunity to apply to judge of the Supreme Court for joinder, and if joined to make representations concerning the further continuation of the injunction. [49] Counsel on the hearing before me takes the position that on the afternoon of September 30th, 1999, he: ...attempted to intervene and make submissions to the Court on several aspects of the injunction application including attempting to gain intervener status in the intended action but that he was denied status and access to the hearing. [50] My examination of the transcript leads me to conclude that counsel for the Union confined his submissions to attempt to convince the Court to permit him to make representations: ...as friend of the Court, and of course, in the interests of my client as well, and in the interests of the operating engineers and the IBEW, who are not my clients. [51] This conclusion is supported by the absence of any affidavits filed on behalf of the Union before Justice Tidman supporting any submission to join the Union pursuant to Rule 5.04 or Rule 8. [52] In addition, the transcript does not disclose that counsel for the Union requested an adjournment in order to prepare the documents that are usually filed in support of an application under either of these Rules. [53] The order of October 1st simply continued the interim injunction “until further order of the Court”. These words were used, presumably, because the Court anticipated that Dexter would commence an action in the Supreme Court, as counsel had advised. That action, one would expect, would include request for injunctive relief for specific time limit. [54] All of the issues set forth in the proposed notice of appeal are issues that can properly be addressed by the Union if it is joined by application to Supreme Court judge. The forum of the Supreme Court is the proper forum to enable both parties to adduce evidence in support of their respective opposed submissions. [55] The Union further submits that if its submissions to grant intervener status pursuant to Rule and joinder pursuant to Rule 5.04 are rejected, then request is made to refer the issue of joinder as party to panel of this Court. This was the practice followed by Angers, J. A., of the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick, sitting in Chambers, in la Societe des Acadiens du Nouveau-Brunswick Inc., et al, v. Minority Language School Board No. 50 (1984) 53 N.B.R. (2d) 158. [56] In that case, an association of parents applied to Justice Angers to be added as party for leave to appeal the decision of Chief Justice Richard, rendered in an action brought by the Society against the School Board. The association of parents was not party to the action. [57] Justice Angers stated at p. 161: Since there is nothing in the Judicature Act nor in the Rules of Court which provides that such an application can be heard by single judge, it is my opinion that the application should be dealt with by the Court of Appeal. Accordingly, am adjourning these applications into the Court of Appeal to be heard by the Court on March 1st, 1984, at 2:00 p.m. [58] The Court of Appeal of New Brunswick subsequently determined 1984 CanLII 2954 (NB CA), [1984] D.L.R. (4th) 238, that an order should issue granting the association of parents leave to appeal as the defendant in the case. Rather than relying on Rule 15 of the New Brunswick Rules of Court dealing with intervention, the Court concluded that it had jurisdiction to add party for the purpose of launching an appeal, such authority arising from the provisions of the Judicature Act which incorporated the ancient practice of the High Court of Chancery in England. An appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed 1986 CanLII 66 (SCC), [1986] S.C.R. 549. [59] decline the request to refer this matter to panel. [60] The history of the proceedings in the present case, is not comparable to the history of the proceedings in the Association case. [61] Chief Justice Richard presided over trial that lasted in excess of ten days. The parties had agreed on statement of facts and extensive viva voce evidence, expert and otherwise, was called. Voluminous exhibits were introduced. final determination of the issues was made by Chief Justice Richard in lengthy judgment. At the time the association of parents applied for joinder before Justice Angers, the decision of Chief Justice Richard determining the issues in the case had been rendered. The opportunity for participation at the trial level had, unlike the opportunity available to the Union here, long since passed. [62] The present proceeding is still at the stage of interlocutory proceedings. No viva voce evidence has yet been adduced. No final determination has been made by trial judge. The only order issued is one that provides for the continuation of an interim injunction until further order of the Court. Indeed, an action has not yet been commenced. This is in marked contrast to the situation that was before Mr. Justice Angers. [63] Rule 5.04 and Rule 8, are primarily designed for adding parties, or for intervention at the trial level. (See comments of Hallett, J.A. in Adams, at pp. 214-215, respecting Rule 8). [64] Rule 62.35 governs interventions to the Court of Appeal in an existing appeal. [65] A judge of this Court sitting in Chambers does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status pursuant to Rule 8 or to join a person as a party to a proceeding pursuant to Rule 5.04. [66] As the Union was not a party to the original proceeding commenced by Dexter, and has not been joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a judge of the Supreme Court, the Union does not, in my opinion, have any standing to file an appeal. [67] do not accept the Union’s submission that it applied to Justice Tidman to be joined as an intervener, or as party, pursuant to Rule 5.04 or Rule 8. [68] Even if had the jurisdiction to add the Union as party pursuant to Rule 5.04, or as an intervener pursuant to Rule 8, would decline to exercise such discretion in view of the remedies available to the Union at the level of the Supreme Court. [69] would further decline to exercise my discretion to refer this matter to panel of the Court in view of the remedies available to the Union at the Supreme Court level. [70] Accordingly, I reject the applications for leave to obtain intervener status as a party, or as amicus curiae, or alternatively as an intervener, and I further reject the application to set down this matter for hearing before a panel of this Court. [71] In the circumstances, decline to award costs. Pugsley, J.A.",2_1999nsca132.txt,"The respondent filed an interlocutory notice, ex parte application, against the intended defendants, seeking an interim injunction.
The applicant union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Rule 62.35, or as amicus currie pursuant to Rule 8.02, or alternatively as an intervener pursuant to Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1), and to bring an appeal from orders made by a Supreme Court judge in proceedings brought by the intended plaintiff against the intended defendants.
Rejecting the applications,
that a Court of Appeal judge sitting in chambers does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status or to join a person as a party to a proceeding.
Furthermore, as the union was not a party to the original proceeding, and was not joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a Supreme Court judge, it does not have standing to file an appeal."

Racine for the defendant (applicant) FIAT GEREIN, J. July 18, 2006 [1] This is an application for an order striking out the plaintiff’s claim in defamation.
I decline to grant the order.
THE APPLICATION[2] The application is brought pursuant to Queen’s Bench Rule 173 which provides: 173.
The Court may at any stage of an action order any pleading or any part thereof to be struck out, with or without leave to amend, on the ground that:(a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be: .
.
.
(c) it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious; .
.
.
(e) it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court;and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly or may grant such order as may be just.
Unless otherwise directed, the offending party shall pay double the costs to which the other party would otherwise be entitled.
The grounds in support of the application, as set out in the notice of motion, are these:1.
The Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim discloses no reasonable cause of action.","The accused, charged with fraud, brought a motion to stay the proceedings on the basis that his Charter rights had been violated by the RCMP and the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy.
The accused asked the court to reconsider its decision to quash a subpoena issued to the former Superintendent of Bankruptcy on the basis of testimony presented from other witnesses after the subpoena was quashed.
Application dismissed;
the accused had not met the onus on the balance of probabilities of establishing that the former Superintendent had relevant or material evidence to offer concerning the issues raised by the Charter motions.
The subsequent testimony and documentation did not support the accused's allegations concerning the former Superintendent's motives or conduct.","[2, 4, 0, 3, 5, 7, 1, 9, 8, 10, 15, 14, 11, 13, 12, 6]",35,"Date: 2002/01/09 Docket: Cr.No. 145665 CANADA Cr. No. 145665 PROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIA IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA [Cite as R. v. Black, 2002, NSSC No. 026 HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN against FREDERICK WILLIAM LOGAN BLACK HEARD: Before the Honourable Justice John D. Murphy, Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on December 17, 2001. DECISION: December 17, 2001, Orally. RELEASE OF ORAL: January 29, 2002 COUNSEL: Gary Holt, Q.C., for the Crown Frederick Black, personally, Defence D. Bruce Clarke, for George Redling MURPHY, J. [1] Frederick Black has been charged with three counts of fraud, contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, relating to his activities as president and principal shareholder of NsC Diesel Power Inc. (“NsC”), a bankrupt corporation. Mr Black has brought motions (the “Charter Motions”) seeking a stay of those charges on the basis that his rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated by the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy (“OSB”) and by the R.C.M.P. during investigations of his activities and of the administration of the NsC bankruptcy. The present Application is made by Mr. Black seeking an Order compelling George Redling, who was Superintendent of Bankruptcy while those investigations were being conducted, to testify at the hearing of the Charter Motions. [2] This Court has already considered whether Mr. Redling should testify, and on December 4, 2001 quashed subpoena (the “Subpoena”) which Mr. Black had served directing his attendance to give evidence at the Charter Motions hearing. The reasons which provided when giving that decision canvassed the involvement of Mr. Redling and other persons in the OSB in relation to Mr. Black’s affairs, and explained the basis upon which determined that Mr Redling was unlikely to be able to provide relevant or material evidence concerning issues raised by the Charter Motions. [3] After the Subpoena was quashed, Mr Black presented additional testimony from RCMP officers and evidence from Charles Walker, who was senior official in the Halifax Office of the OSB during Mr. Redling’s tenure. Mr. Black now suggests that the evidence which those witnesses gave and the documents to which they referred raise issues which warrant compelling Mr. Redling’s attendance. The present application could be characterized as a request for re-consideration of the decision to quash the Subpoena, in light of additional information which Mr Black says has become available during subsequent testimony and from the documents which have now been provided. [4] After reviewing the Notice of Motion and Mr. Black’s affidavit, and hearing representations from Mr. Black, from Mr. Clarke on behalf of Mr. Redling, and from Mr. Holt, I have decided to dismiss the Application to require Mr. Redling’s attendance, and no subpoena will be issued to him. [5] Mr Black has not met the onus which rests upon him to satisfy the Court on the balance of probabilities that Mr. Redling has relevant or material evidence to give concerning the issues raised by the Charter Motions. The testimony and documentation presented since the Subpoena was quashed do not provide any basis to compel his attendance. [6] Mr. Black referred particularly to the last two pages of Exhibit 156, handwritten notes which have been attributed to Mr. Redling. One page is dated “September 30th” and it has been assumed the reference is to that date in 1993, during the period when Charles Piper was investigating the administration of the bankruptcy of NsC for the OSB. In Paragraph 11 of his affidavit in support of the application, and also during argument, Mr. Black suggested that those notes indicate an attempt by Mr. Redling to influence the form and content of the report provided by Mr. Piper, which led to the R.C.M.P. investigation into Mr. Black’s conduct. Several witnesses have given very detailed evidence concerning the activities of the OSB and the R.C.M.P., and there is neither testimony nor anything apparent in the notes to support Mr. Black’s interpretation. Mr. Black has also scheduled Mr. Piper to testify during the Charter Motions hearings, and will have an opportunity to explore any factors which influenced that report directly with Mr. Piper. [7] In his supporting affidavit Mr Black also expressed beliefs that Mr. Redling’s motives and conduct were improper, particularly in covering up alleged wrongdoings by Ernst and Young and encouraging overzealous investigating of his conduct. Mr. Black suggests that the OSB, under Mr Redling as Superintendent, did not pursue investigations into other parties with sufficient vigor, and that Mr. Redling somehow dissuaded the RCMP from investigating other parties’ conduct and deflected suspicion of wrongdoing to him. [8] Nothing which has come before the Court since the Subpoena was quashed (or at any time) supports those beliefs expressed by Mr. Black. No likelihood has been established that Mr. Redling will provide any evidence concerning the investigation into the conduct of any other party which would be relevant or material to the issues raised by to the Charter Motions. The Court’s concern is about the investigation into the conduct of Mr. Black, and it has not been established that any lack of vigorous investigation into activities of other persons involved in the NsC bankruptcy is likely to have affected Mr. Black’s rights with respect to the charges against him. [9] Mr. Black also raises the issue of possible OSB funding of the investigation and/or prosecution of charges against him; however, there is no basis to find that Mr. Redling is likely to provide any additional insight into that issue. [10] The RCMP officers involved have testified that they were not influenced by Mr. Redling or by anyone else in the OSB in the course of their investigation into the activities of Mr. Black. Mr. Mayrand and Mr. Walker from the OSB have also given evidence that they did not influence the R.C.M.P., and am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mr. Redling is likely to have any additional information concerning that issue. [11] am not convinced that Mr. Redling is likely to have any relevant or material evidence to provide with respect to the Charter Motions; have reached that conclusion based on the information and submissions concerning his involvement in the investigations which have been provided during this application, and also based on all the evidence given during the Charter Motions’ hearings. [12] The Application is accordingly dismissed.",2_2002nssc26.txt,"The accused, charged with fraud, brought a motion to stay the proceedings on the basis that his Charter rights had been violated by the RCMP and the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy.

March 14, 2001[1] The applicant seeks an order nisi for sale of a 10 acre parcel of land near Rosetown, Saskatchewan on which the respondents operate an ostrich farming business.
As of February 12, 2001, the amount owing on the mortgage which dates back to October 4, 1988 is $61,194.91.
A current certificate of title still shows the Farm Credit Corporation as a second mortgagee in the amount of $36,000.00, but the affidavit material filed suggests it has been paid out.
The named individuals after the Farm Credit Corporation in the style of cause are members of a law firm that have filed a writ of execution against the property.
The parties agree that since the summer of 1994 the land qualifies as farm land under the Act, and the house located on the property since that time has been a homestead within the meaning of the Act.
Where the parties disagree was whether the property was the respondents' homestead when s. 44(17) of the Act was proclaimed on September 20, 1992.
By the time the respondents entered into the subject mortgage on October 4, 1988 they were living in their home on the property.","The two accused were found guilty, after trial, of robbery with violence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code and wearing a mask with the intent to commit an indictable offence contrary to s. 351(2) of the Code.
HELD: The accused are sentenced to 40 months imprisonment for the offence of robbery with violence and 4 months consecutive for the offence of having their faces masked.
Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months.
The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary.
The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 11, 6, 10, 15]",532,"QUEEN’S BENCH FOR SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2007 SKQB 444 Date: 2007 11 29 Docket: Q.B. CNJ 43/07 Judicial Centre: Regina BETWEEN: HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN [J.L.P.] AND [T.T.A.] Counsel Bryce Pashovitz for the Crown Jeffrey W. Deagle for [J.L.P.] Robin Neufeld for [T.T.A.] SENTENCING CHICOINE, J. November 29, 2007 Note: This sentencing decision was read into the record of the trial on November 29, 2007. The transcript of the proceedings is the official record. INTRODUCTION [1] [J.L.P.] and [T.T.A.] have been found guilty after trial of committing two offences, namely: That on or about the 12th day of January, 2007 at or near Regina in the Province of Saskatchewan, they did steal cash and miscellaneous items, the property of Southland Corporation (Devonshire Seven Eleven), and at the time thereof did use violence against Larry Bryska, contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code; That on or about the 12th day of January, 2007 at or near Regina in the Province of Saskatchewan, they did with intent to commit an indictable offence, have their faces masked, contrary to s. 351(2) of the Criminal Code. [2] It is not my intention to review all of the findings of fact upon which the convictions were based as previously rendered decision on October 10, 2007. It would be useful, however, to summarize those findings in order to put the offences in their proper perspective for the purpose of determining the appropriate sentence for each. [3] The offence of robbery with violence relates to robbery which occurred at about 5:30 a.m. on January 12, 2007 at the Seven-Eleven convenience store at the intersection of Devonshire Drive and Rochdale Boulevard in the City of Regina. Four masked individuals in dark clothing entered the store. Three approached the loan store clerk behind the counter and the fourth, being Mr. [J.L.P.], stood guard at the door. Mr. [J.L.P.] was holding some sort of bar or pole variously described as or chair or table leg. least two of the individuals who approached the counter were carrying knives. The clerk was forced to the floor. At one point one of the robbers said, ""Don't stab him. Just kick him in the head."" Two of the individuals, one of whom was 13 years old, grabbed about 120 packs of cigarettes and put them in their backpack or jackets. The other individual, Mr. [T.T.A.], took the till tray with $150.00 to $180.00 in cash. Before leaving the store, one of these individuals kicked the clerk in the head twice. All four exited the store and got into car which headed east on Rochdale Boulevard. [4] At the time of the robbery, another employee was in back room of the store and was able to view the robbery in progress on video monitor. He called the police and advised them that the robbers had left in what he thought was Chrysler or Dodge automobile. [5] Cst. Craig Solomon of the Regina City Police heard of the robbery while on patrol in marked Ford Expedition near the intersection of McCarthy Boulevard and 9th Avenue North. He and his partner proceeded north on McCarthy. They noted Chrysler Intrepid that was proceeding east on Rochdale make right turn and thereafter proceed south on McCarthy. The officers made U-turn to follow this vehicle with emergency lights and siren activated. At speed of 100 kms per hour the police vehicle was just keeping pace with the Chrysler. The posted speed limit on that street is 50 kms per hour. The vehicles proceeded through green lights at the intersections of Dalgliesh Drive and Rink Avenue. The getaway vehicle went through red light at 9th Avenue North at which time the police officers discontinued the pursuit. Cst. Solomon noted the vehicle to make left turn on red light at 7th Avenue North. [6] Identification of Mr. [J.L.P.] and Mr. [T.T.A.] as participants in this robbery was accomplished through oral testimony of two witnesses subpoenaed to testify at the trial Mr. [J.L.P.]'s brother-in-law and the 13-year-old accomplice. THE ACCUSED [7] Mr. [J.L.P.] is now 19 years of age and has resided in Regina since age 10 following his parents' separation. He has good relationship with his mother. Unfortunately, his father was victim of murder in 1999 when his son would have been 11 years old. Mr. [J.L.P.] suffers from some unresolved issues as result of his father's tragic death, evidenced by the fact that he was convicted of his first criminal offence at age 12. [8] Mr. [J.L.P.] is few credits shy of getting his Grade 12 diploma. He had planned to attend an adult education program at the time of his arrest. He has worked as an electrician's helper for his mother's boyfriend and he has an interest in carpentry. He admits to substance abuse, including alcohol, marijuana and cocaine. [9] Mr. [T.T.A.] is also 19 years of age. He grew up on the Pasqua First Nation. He does not get along with his parents. He lived with his grandparents most of the time. Unfortunately, his grandfather died two years ago. [10] Mr. [T.T.A.] has not completed his grade 10. He started using alcohol and drugs at age 13, and continues to use marijuana and cocaine. He plans to continue his education, get married and lead normal life. MR. [J.L.P.]’S CRIMINAL RECORD [11] Mr. [J.L.P.] has fairly significant criminal record which includes convictions for offences against the person, against property and against the administration of law and justice. His first conviction as young offender was for break, enter and theft at age 12 and was twice convicted for the same offence at age 13. He received open custody and probation. His first serious violent offence was an assault with weapon at age 14 for stabbing the victim in the neck with knife. He was sentenced to 10 months secure custody. At age 15, he was convicted of robbery which involved theft of gold earring from 14-year-old victim. He received sentence of 12 months in secure custody and six months supervision in the community. At the same time, he was convicted of possession of stolen vehicle and for flight from police for which he received concurrent sentence. month later, he was convicted of possession of stolen vehicle and escaping lawful custody for which he was sentenced to 280 days in closed custody and 140 days supervision in the community, concurrent. [12] In 2004 at age 16, Mr. [J.L.P.] was convicted of escaping lawful custody, two charges of taking vehicle without the owner's consent, one charge of theft of vehicle and charge of possession of break-in instruments. He was sentenced to total of 16 months closed custody and six months supervision in the community. In 2005 at age 17, he was convicted of possession of property under $5000.00 and being unlawfully at large for which he was sentenced to 100 days of closed custody on each charge and 50 days supervision in the community. At the same time, he was convicted of uttering threats and received concurrent sentence. [13] Mr. [J.L.P.]'s record as an adult consists of conviction in September of 2006 for driving while impaired and another conviction for possession of stolen vehicle for which he received custodial sentences of two months on each charge, concurrent. MR. [T.T.A.]’S CRIMINALRECORD [14] Mr. [T.T.A.] also has significant criminal record consisting of 35 convictions, all as youth. [15] His first conviction was in 2001 at age 13 on two charges of robbery, one charge of theft under $5000.00, one charge of possession of property obtained by crime, and two charges against the administration of justice for failing to attend court and failing to comply with recognizance. He received four months open custody and one year of probation. Two months later he was convicted of being unlawfully at large and sentenced to time served. Two months after that, he was convicted of one charge of escaping lawful custody, three charges of possession of property obtained by crime under $5000.00, three charges of taking motor vehicle without the owner's consent, and one charge of theft under $5000.00. He was sentenced to three months in secure custody and nine months of probation on each charge to be served concurrently. [16] In 2002 at age 14, Mr. [T.T.A.] was convicted of attempt to break and enter and was sentenced to time served, being 26 days. few months later, he was convicted of three charges of possession of property obtained by crime over $5000.00 and charge of flight from police officer. He was sentenced to 46 days time served plus an additional four months of secure custody. [17] In 2003, before his 14th birthday, he was convicted of theft under $5000.00, failing to comply with court order and mischief. He was sentenced to five months of secure custody. After his 14th birthday, he was convicted of possession of stolen goods over $5000.00 and taking motor vehicle without the owner's consent. He received sentence of 320 days and 160 days of supervision in the community. [18] In 2004, at age 15, Mr. [T.T.A.] was convicted of dangerous operation of motor vehicle, carrying concealed weapon and possession of property obtained by crime over $5000.00. He was sentenced to 12 months closed custody and months of supervision in the community. [19] In 2005, at age 16, Mr. [T.T.A.] was convicted of possession of property obtained by crime over $5000.00, failing to stop at the scene of an accident, dangerous driving, and obstruction of peace officer. He received sentence of 260 days closed custody and 130 days supervision in the community. [20] Mr. [T.T.A.]'s last conviction as youth was in January of 2006 at age 17, for mischief under $5000.00 for which he was sentenced to 20 days of closed custody and 10 days of supervision in the community. PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING [21] The purpose and principles of sentencing are outlined in s. 718 of the Criminal Code which states: 718 The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives: (a) to denounce unlawful conduct (b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences (c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary; (d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders (e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and (f) to promote sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community. [22] The following sections of the Code are also relevant: 718.1 sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender 718.2 court that imposes sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles, namely: (a) sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender; (b) sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances; (c) where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh; (d) and offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and (e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders. APPLICATION OF SENTENCING PRINCIPLES [23] In applying these principles, consider the following factors to be aggravating: The robbery was committed against person in vulnerable position. Attendants of all-night convenience stores work evening and night-time shifts, often at little more than minimum wage. They are often required to work alone or with only one other co-worker. They are subjected to threats of violence and at times physical harm. They often suffer significant and lasting mental anguish from the traumatic experience. All courts have recognized the need to protect people in these positions. The accuseds' criminal records, which have already described in detail, are appalling. While most of the offences in respect to Mr. [J.L.P.] and all of the offences in respect of Mr. [T.T.A.] were committed when they were youth, the records show failure to respond to progressively longer and more restrictive sentences. The gratuitous assault upon the attendant in this case the kick in the head prior to leaving the store with the stolen cash and cigarettes brings the offence to yet another level. The fact that 13-year-old was conscripted to participate in this serious and violent crime. The fact that high speed vehicle chase ensued after the robbery on major thoroughfare in the City of Regina, with the getaway vehicle approaching speeds of 100 kms per hour and driving through red lights. Were it not for the Regina City Police policy of restraint in high speed pursuits, innocent bystanders could have been killed or injured. The fact that neither accused shows any remorse for his actions and for the harm which he has inflicted upon the victim or the owner of the business. These are all factors which militate against sentence in the lower range of sentences for offences of this nature. [24] The only factor that might be in any way considered mitigating is the lack of parental care and guidance which each of the accused have endured from an early age. [25] Section 718.2(b) of the Code directs that sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances. The prosecutor and defence counsel have referred to number of cases in the course of their submissions which prescribe range of sentence for robberies with violence. [26] Among the cases referred to by the Crown was R. v. Ahenakew, [2001] S.J. No. 695, 2001 SKCA 117 (CanLII), 213 Sask. R. 292 wherein the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal determined that conditional sentence of two years less day for robbery with violence committed at bar was inadequate. Mister Justice Wakeling said the following at para. 7: The trial judge erred in imposing conditional sentence. This Court said as follows in R. v. Severight (1996), 1996 CanLII 4934 (SK CA), 137 Sask. R. 306: We have frequently pointed out that robbery with violence is the type of crime from which the public is to be protected. Accordingly any sentence imposed must leave no doubt that such conduct will not be tolerated. Armed robbery involves an inherent danger to human life because escalation of violence toward the victim or lawful resistance by the victim to an attack can easily result in death or serious bodily harm. The following statement of Wakeling J.A., speaking for this Court in R. v. Alexson, [1991] S.J. No. 268(Sask. C.A., June 1991), is apposite: This Court has repeatedly indicated that offences of this nature will be treated severely. This is the only means available to the courts to discourage crimes of this nature which involve victims who are particularly vulnerable to such an attack. The range of sentences is such that years is at the lower end of the scale for an offence of this nature. After giving credit for six months already served as conditional sentence and the community service already put in, the court decided that sentence of two-years-less-a-day of imprisonment would be imposed from the date of the appeal decision. [27] In this case, the Crown recommends that both accused receive sentence of more than two years in addition to the time already served. Both accused have been in custody since January 31, 2007, which is now almost 10 months. [28] Defence counsel has referred me to the case of R. v. Cheekinew 2007 SKCA (SentDig) 24, wherein 19-year-old appealed an 18 month jail sentence for robbery with violence committed on an individual at bus stop. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. His previous record included two robbery convictions and one theft related. The case is only reported in the sentencing digest so do not know what factors influenced the provincial court judge to sentence the offender to 18 months. It would be unusual for the Court of Appeal to increase sentence on an appeal by the accused and it does not appear that the Crown had cross-appealed. [29] Defence counsel also referred to R. v. Halkett [2002] SKCA (SentDig) 50, wherein 21-year-old received sentence of two-years-less-a-day from the Provincial Court Judge for robbery with violence which involved entering into home with an accomplice, assaulting the male victim and his wife, and leaving with money, jewellery and the victim's truck. This accuseds' previous record included robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, and property related offences. On Crown appeal, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal increased the sentence to three years. [30] In addition to the cases referred to me by counsel, have read number of cases from this jurisdiction involving sentences for robbery with violence including R. v. Bowman, 1988 CanLII 5105 (SK CA), [1988] S.J. No. 471, 67 Sask. R. 314, wherein Mr. Justice Vancise decided that sentence of four years concurrent was not appropriate in that case where the accused had committed four previous armed robberies. He stated: [The sentence] fails to take into account the fact that this Court on number of occasions has stated that it will impose long sentences on people who victimize persons who are vulnerable, such as taxi drivers, shopkeepers and employees who work for 24-hour convenience stores. The trial judge, in our opinion, failed to adequately take into account the need for the protection of the public from individuals such as the accused. [31] In R. v. Warkentin, 1994 CanLII 3877 (SK CA), [1994] S.J. No. 591, 125 Sask. R. 236, Mister Justice Cameron set aside sentence of one year incarceration to be served concurrently for four armed robbery convictions and substituted four years concurrent in respect of each count. He stated (at para. 5): With respect, we are of the view the armed robbery sentences imposed under section 344 were unfit. They fit neither the offender nor the offences and must be increased, having regard for seriousness of the offenses and the need to protect the public, deter crime, and uphold society's confidence in the administration of justice, including effective enforcement of the Criminal Code. .... [32] have also considered R. v. Sangwais, [2002] S.J. No. 298, 2002 SKCA 63 (CanLII), 223 Sask. R. 222, in which the accused robbed variety store in small town, striking 50-year-old female clerk on the head with long piece of wood and tying her up. He had lengthy criminal record with 37 prior convictions including assault causing bodily harm, assault, weapons offences and many offences against the administration of justice. The trial judge gave him two-year-less-a-day conditional sentence, taking into account that he had spent 16 months on remand. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal stated that the trial judge had failed to give consideration to the gravity of the offence and had ignored the objectives of denunciation and deterrence and public confidence in the administration of justice. The Court of Appeal increased the sentence to two-years-less-a-day for the date of the appeal. Considering the time on remand, this was equivalent to at least 56 months (more that 1/2 years). [33] In considering an appropriate sentence in the circumstances, must also take into consideration the effect of the violence committed against the victim, Mr. Bryska. While he did not provide victim impact statement, his demeanor in the stand clearly indicated the pain of having to once again relive the experience of being robbed at knife-point and being physically assaulted in the process. [34] Having considered the circumstances of the offences and the submissions of the Crown and counsel for each of the accused, will now proceed to consider what fit and proper sentence is in this case. [35] The law of Canada provides that person convicted of robbery is liable to imprisonment for life. For the offence of masking one's face with intent to commit an indictable offence, person can be sentenced to term not exceeding ten years. Parliament has dictated by these sentence ranges that the punishment for these crimes can be substantial. [36] Taking into consideration the sentencing principles that have referred to above, especially the need for deterrence and denunciation, have determined that sentences to be served in federal penitentiary are warranted in these circumstances. will particularize the sentences as regards to each offence and each offender in moment. [37] Having determined that the sentences will not be two years or less, it is not necessary for me to consider whether conditional sentence would be appropriate. In any event, am also of the opinion, even if the global sentence had been less than two years, that conditional sentences would be inconsistent with the fundamental purpose and principles set out in s. 718 and 718.2 for these offences and these offenders. THE SENTENCE [38] Having considered the aggravating and mitigating factors referred to earlier, the circumstances surrounding the commission of these offences, the harm perpetrated upon the victim, and taking into consideration the previous records of both of these accused, I have come to the conclusion that the best interests of society and the administration of justice will be served with sentences particularized as follows: For both Mr. [J.L.P.] and Mr. [T.T.A.], for the offence of robbery with violence under s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code; 40 months imprisonment. For both Mr. [J.L.P.] and Mr. [T.T.A.], for the offence of having their faces masked with intent to commit an indictable offence under s. 351(2) of the Criminal Code; four months of imprisonment consecutive to the sentence for the robbery with violence. The total of these sentences is 44 months. Having regard for the fact that both accused have been in custody since January 31, 2007 -- which is a period of nearly 10 months -- I will give each of them two for one credit for time served on remand which is 20 months. The sentence which each of them will serve from this date is two years to be served in a federal penitentiary. [39] The sentence that I have imposed on each of these offenders takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued within the City of Regina, and the need to deter not only these individuals but also anyone else who might consider committing the offence of robbery. These are appropriate sentences in the circumstances. note for the record that the Crown and counsel for Mr. [T.T.A.] had made joint submission for sentence of two years to be served in federal penitentiary so that Mr. [T.T.A.] could have access to better programming and treatment while incarcerated. Even without the joint submission, this court would have concluded that penitentiary term was warranted in addition to the time served on remand. [40] Counsel for Mr. [J.L.P.] on the other hand, had submitted that an additional 12 months would have been sufficient given that his client had served the equivalent of 20 months already. However, considering that there were few mitigating circumstances and numerous aggravating circumstances which take this offender and this offence out of the lower range of three years, and the fact that consecutive term of imprisonment was warranted for the s. 351(2) Criminal Code offence, can say with certainty that Mr. [J.L.P.] was facing sentence of more than two years in addition to time served on remand. In this case, parity in sentencing has worked in his favour. [41] The Crown has advised that no order for DNA sample is required in respect of Mr. [J.L.P.] as there has been previous order. However, do make an order in form 5.04 pursuant to s. 487.052(1) authorizing the taking from Mr. [T.T.A.], for the purposes of forensic DNA analysis, of any number of samples of one or more bodily substances that is reasonably required for that purpose by means of the investigative procedures described in s. 487.06(1) as am satisfied it is in the best interests of the administration of justice to do so. [42] Further, pursuant to s. 109 of the Criminal Code also make an order prohibiting both Mr. [J.L.P.] and Mr. [T.T.A.] from possessing any firearm, cross bow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition and explosive substance during the period that begins on this day and ends not earlier than ten years after release from imprisonment. Both are required to forthwith surrender to peace officer anything the possession of which is prohibited by this order and to forthwith surrender every authorization, licence and registration certificate currently held by either of them relating to anything, the possession of which is now prohibited. The above items shall be forfeited to Her Majesty the Queen and may be disposed of as the Attorney-General directs. [43] The victim surcharge will be waived in respect of each Mr. [J.L.P.] and Mr. [T.T.A.] in consideration of the fact that they have already been in custody for ten months. G.A.

Kathryn Joan MacKay (the ""respondent"") opposes the application. He also seeks an order expunging any arrears. The relevant terms of the divorce judgment are as 1. THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that the respondent wife shall have custody of the children of the marriage, namely, Ryan Douglas Savenkoff born October 4, 1981, and Brett James Savenkoff born April 4, 1983. 3. THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that (a) The petitioner husband shall pay to the respondent wife for her support and for the support of the two infant children the sum of $1,200.00 per month payable to the Support and Custody Order Enforcement Office. (b) The respondent wife shall no longer be entitled to the petitioner husband's support upon the respondent wife obtaining full time employment or January 1, 1990, whichever occurs first. Upon the happening of the first of the above events, the support payable by the husband shall be exclusively for the support of the infant children. (c) Upon the wife obtaining full time employment or January 1, 1990, whichever first occurs, the parties shall confer either personally or through their solicitors or, if agreed, through mediator to reassess the quantum of support payable. The obtaining of full time employment alone shall not automatically constitute material change in circumstances that warrants reduction in support. It shall, rather, constitute an event that shall make support reviewable based on the new financial circumstances of each child and the parties. In this regard, the parties shall co-operate fully with each other and provide such financial information as is reasonably requested from either party. In the event that agreement cannot be reached within 30 days of the commencement of negotiations either party shall be entitled to apply to this Honourable Court to determine the quantum of support. Until new determination of the quantum of support is made, the quantum of support shall not change.

THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that the petitioner husband shall maintain all medical, dental, drug and other health benefit plans currently available through his employment with General Motors of Canada Limited or available through such other employment as he may obtain for the benefit of the children for so long as they are entitled to his support The applicant submits an agreement was reached inAugust of 1989 in accordance with paragraph 2(c) of thejudgment reducing the maintenance from $1,200 per month to$500 per month, which amount was paid from August, 1989 up toand including August, 1993. further agreement was then made increasing the monthly maintenance commencing September 1, 1993 to $554.13 and further increasing the maintenance in January, 1994 to $570.75. The applicant says in addition to the above maintenance, he provides $50 per month directly to the children as allowance, contributes approximately $1,500 per year for hockey expenses and pays annual return air fare of approximately $2,200 in order that he may exercise access to his children. The applicant became unemployed in 1993, having accepted severance package with General Motors. Due to his father's poor health he moved to the Pelly District to assist with his parents' farming operation. He is currently helping with the farm and is working part time as the rink superintendent in the Town of Pelly earning $320 per month during the winter months. The respondent denies any agreement to reduce themaintenance from the original order. However, she does suggest there were agreements to pay additional costs which have not been honoured. She says the arrears pursuant to the judgment are nowin excess of $55,636.21. The respondent submits her expenses for the children are high as result of their desire to participate in sports activities (which include travel), the need for orthodontic treatment, and her desire to enrol one of the children in private school for gifted children. I have reviewed all of the material filed and havedetermined it will not be possible to deal with this matter in asummary way. The respondent alleges the arrears are in excess of $55,636.21 on the basis of the original order. The applicant alleges there were agreements to amend the original order as contemplated by the order and that he has complied fully with the original order and with all amendments thereto. He denies there are any arrears. This cannot be resolved on the basis of theinformation before the Court.

For the Accused DECISION D.J.
KOVATCH, J Background[1] The accused, Karyn Mae Fayant is charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window, and with an aggravated assault upon Joe Cwynar.
The major issue for determination is whether the accused can be convicted of the charge of aggravated assault, or whether she should be convicted of one of the lesser and included offences.
Evidence[2] The complainant, Joe Cwynar, testified that he and the accused have been in an on and off relationship since March 2004.
In April, 2010, he and the complainant met up and were house sitting at Fort Qu’appelle, Saskatchewan.
[3] On the way to Mossbank, the accused purchased some alcohol.
They arrived at the complainant’s home in the neighbourhood of 6:30 to 7:00 p.m.
According to Mr. Cwynar, the accused then began drinking.
According to him, the accused became quite drunk and suggested that the two of them go for a walk.
They did go outside, and then got into an argument because the complainant believed he had lost his keys.
They then returned to the home.
Once inside the home, the argument escalated.
The accused then picked up a plastic candle holder.","The vendor's application for an order declaring that the purchaser's objection was without merit was commenced 13 days after the closing date.

Denise Meisner (purchaser), is without merit. [2] Section of the Act provides: Application for determination of question vendor or purchaser of any interest in land or his representative may, at any time and from time to time, apply in summary way to judge or local judge of the Trial Division of the Supreme Court in respect of any requisition or objection or any claim for compensation, or any other question arising out of or connected with the contract and the judge or local judge may make such order upon the application as appears just, and refer any question to referee or other officer for inquiry and report. [3] The parties entered into an agreement of purchase and sale dated October 25, 2002. The agreement provided for closing of the transaction on November 14, 2002. The agreement contains the following clause: 15. Time shall in all respects be of the essence in the Agreement. In the event of written agreement of extension, time shall continue to be of the essence. This Agreement shall enure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto, their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. This Agreement is to be read with all changes of gender or number required of the context. [4] The purchaser’s solicitor made an objection to title by letter dated November 8, 2002. There was communication between the solicitors for the vendor and for the purchaser. The purchaser’s solicitor did not accept the answer to the objection to title given by the vendor’s solicitor. The purchaser’s solicitor agreed to extend the closing date to November 15, 2002 by letter dated November 14, 2002. The present application was commenced November 28, 2002. [5] In dealing with when an application pursuant to the Act may be brought various texts provide as follows. In the Nova Scotia Real Property Practice Manual, Butterworths, C.W. MacIntosh, Q.C. states at p. 4-41: The application must be commenced and heard before the date for closing, which is not automatically extended by reason of the application. Any extension must be agreed to by the parties. Authority for the statement is given as Raymond and Raymond v. Doubleday and Doubleday (1984), 65 N.S.R. (2d) 179 (T.D.). [6] In Lamont on Real Estate Conveyancing (2nd ed.), Carswell, it states at p. 11-1: As stated in Chapter 10, if valid requisition is submitted and the answer does not appear satisfactory, resort can be had to vendor’s and purchaser’s application for an adjudication on the apparent title problem. Such an application for an adjudication must be commenced and heard before the closing date for the transaction in order to preserve the parties’ rights to close or not to close on the closing date. It is misconception to think that by proceeding with vendor’s and purchaser’s application that the closing date of the transaction will be automatically put over until the application is heard. The closing date will only be postponed if the parties agree. [7] In Di Castri, The Law of Vendor and Purchaser (3rd. ed.), it states at p. 13-134.1: The summary procedure, so far as the jurisdiction permits, avoids the necessity of resorting to an action for specific performance, but is available only during the pendency of the contract and not after its completion. ... The authority for the statement in Di Castri is given as Re Buhlman and London Life Ins. Co. (1932), 41 O.W.N. 17. [8] Both Raymond and Raymond v. Doubleday and Doubleday, supra and Re Buhlman and London Life Ins. Co., supra are cases where the transactions were completed and the Courts held an application pursuant to the Act is not available after the transaction is completed. Those cases are not authority that an application must be commenced and heard before the date of closing. In this case, the contract was not completed, but terminated upon the date for closing passing without extension. [9] disagree an application pursuant to the Act must be completed before the closing date. Such an interpretation is too draconian. There may be many reasons, beyond the control of an applicant, why the application cannot be heard before closing date. However, it is within the control of an applicant to commence an application before the closing date of the transaction. While an application does not have to be heard before the date of closing, it must be commenced before the date of closing. [10] Time was of the essence in the agreement. The purchaser agreed to extend the closing date to November 15, 2002. The contract ended before the application was commenced. The application was not made during the pendency of the contract. [11] The application is dismissed. [12] If the parties are unable to agree, will hear them on the issue of costs. C.

Read lots....this doing time is hard on Remand. Remand is different than population. Remind is kinda hard time. may as well get to the point ... I'm charged with armed robbery ... and I'm trying to find an alibi. witness to tell them was at Eureka Club. 1st I'll say, really don't think you'll want to do this, certainly don't expect you too, and if you don't, absolutely no hard feelings. Could you just hear me out before you decide...? Why am asking you? Well honestly, don't have no friends. I'm totally on my own here. wrote another letter to you (but never sent it) trying to explain how my life ended up this way. No family, no friends. But this other letter sounded to much self pity. guess I'm tryin[sic] to figure out for myself why don't have any close friends. should tell you, these letters are safe, no one reads them. But they open in-coming mail, but usually don't read it. Well don't hardly ever us[sic] the phone, haven't had canteen service since got here. Lost my car last year, my oldest boy won't talk to me, the other kids are in foster care ... are you buttered up yet? I've been here since Feb 5/98 except weeks last summer and also weeks last Christmas. Last fall got charged for armed robbery, this robbery happened last summer (July 18). The Jan 14 got charged for another armed robbery which occurred Jan 8/99. already beat this last one not guilty (Jan 8) so still got this one from last summer. It was DOMO gas station that got robbed. should be able to prove my innocent's[sic], but its close. The robbery happened 10:00 p.m. SATURDAY July 18. On Sept 25/98 someone told cops did it, but cops never took photo line up to gas jockey's[sic] until November. One gas jockey picked my picture and said it was me. The other gas jockey never picked no picture. At my Preliminary Hearing neither gas jockey picked me out (in court room). The only other evidence they have is ... they (cops) say they found motorcycle matching description of one used for this robbery, they found it 2-3 blocks from my apartment. So they really have weak case ... but if judge thinks one gas jockey picking my picture out of photo line up is enough to convict me guilty, I'll get years PEN TIME ... So what I'm asking is ... would you be willing to testify TESTIFY that you seen me at Eureka Club, all night, from 9:00 p.m. 1:00 p.m., Saturday July 18 ... then sometime Sunday talked to you and you remember was really down because July 19 is my littlest boys birthday. was down because LUKE is in Foster Care and couldn't see him on his birthday. This is how you'd remember July 18 at Eureka, the day before Lukes[sic] birthday. We could fill in the blanks, or get our story straight, my trial isn't until June 9. Because I'm writing all this doesn't mean expect you to do this. understand its scary thing and its hassle. I'll still respect and like you if you say no. wrote Sandy Weisgerber letter asking the same and asked JOE ROSS (if you know him) if he would. Joe said he would but he never showed up at my pre-trial conference so can't trust him to show up at my trial. The cops or Crown prosecutor don't know anything about any of this. told my lawyer was at Eureka and am trying to find someone to testify. Before my pre-trial conference told my lawyer Joe Ross might show up ... but he never. Sooooo Also understand, know what I'm doing. know the system. would never ask unless was 100% sure it was safe for you. Its fool proof. For thing Crown has to tell my lawyer all there[sic] evidence before trial, so if somehow Crown could proof[sic] wasn't at Eureka, or you weren't at Eureka, they'd have to tell my lawyer. Remember this was last summer. already phoned Eureka to make sure there was dance that night. There was. There's just nothing that could go wrong. Theirs[sic] the moral issue, but man I've seen cops lie so many times, I've seen the prosecutors lie ... this system sucks. For you it would be ... say you call my lawyer and tell him you'll be witness. Then he has to notify prosecutor, sometimes they'll send cops to take statement from you. I'm not sure if you have to or not. But my lawyer said you don't have to have given statement to testify at trial. So this could be hassle or stress. The cops coming to your house. But you don't have to answer the door. Other than this when you go to court you'd have to wait outside court room till your turn to testify. figure you'd be on the stand about 15-20 minutes. If prosecutor even asked you any questions they'd want to know how you remember this Saturday night, and how can you be sure never left and came back, and did we talk or sit together ... But my lawyer would ask questions 1st and after he asked you all the questions, usually, the prosecutor doesn't ask questions (like in this case) because my lawyer already asked all the questions. could get my lawyer to make it so you don't have to wait outside court room to long. Sometimes witness's have to wait an hour or more. My lawyer keeps telling me to get an alibi (witness). He would help you. If it happens Crown wants statement my lawyer could probably set up time so you could be expecting cops. can't thing of nothing else of importance. Alls[sic] can say is ... If you do this, MAN would appreciate it. would give you my clothing advance I'd get from welfare, thats[sic] 200$ or 250$ ÷2 100$ or 125$. give you my word I'd give this to you. No problem. Compared to over yrs in jail, 100$ is nothing. If it'd[sic] make difference I'd give you more. Like if you'd do it for 500$ please tell me, cause if you could give me months to pay you (in payments) I'd peice[sic] you off, would too. just gotta get job, and will. There's chance oil rigs will start up, then could pay 1st and 2nd check (250$ each). Well, they have weak case, but, this asking you is something had to do, just had to try. Sandy never got back to me and wrote her about wks ago so guess she doesn't want to. If Joe would sow up then you wouldn't have to take the stand. Well, old feller, I've run out of paper. Please don't let any of this stress you out. And no hard feelings if you don't want too[sic]. Gerald Doty If you'll do this just call my lawyer, then I'll give you call. he's not legal aid he's private court appointed My lawyer is Joe Schick 565-5163 [I have added emphasis] [3] admitted this letter into evidence following voir dire. The defence had applied to exclude the letter on the basis that it was obtained by an unreasonable search or seizure and thereby violated the right of the accused under s. of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11. [4] Does the letter admit fact which is against the accused's interest? Or is the letter exculpatory? Or are parts of the letter admissions of fact against the interest of the accused and other parts of the letter exculpatory? What is the evidentiary value of the whole of the letter? [5] The accused expressly said in his letter: He is charged with armed robbery. He is trying to find an alibi. He is seeking a witness to testify that he was at the Eureka Club on the date and at the time of the robbery. The accused says that he should be able to prove his innocence, but it is close. He proposes to the potential witness that they ""could fill in the blanks and get our stories straight"". He says that if the Crown can prove that he was not at the Eureka Club or that the proposed witness were not at the Eureka Club, the Crown would have to give disclosure to the defence. He acknowledges that he is requesting the proposed witness to lie, but justifies it on the rationale that ""cops lie so many times"" and ""the prosecutors lie ... this system sucks"". He coaches the proposed witness by suggesting that the prosecutor may ask how he would be able to remember this particular date and whether the accused was always in the presence of the proposed witness throughout the evening. The accused offers to pay the proposed witness for his proposed testimony. He refers to another potential witness who has not responded to his request to give evidence but says that if that other witness were to appear at trial, then the witness to whom this letter were addressed would not be required to testify. [6] Of course, the letter is not an alibi — it is an attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi. If it were an alibi, the requirements set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Cleghorn (1995), 1995 CanLII 63 (SCC), 100 C.C.C. (3d) 393 would apply that is, it must be given in sufficient time to permit the authorities to investigate and it must be given with sufficient particularity to enable the authorities to meaningfully investigate. Furthermore, when alibi evidence is offered at trial, the trial judge has the opportunity to weigh and assess the alibi evidence in light of all of the other evidence, and to assess credibility. As well, the trial judge then has the benefit of guidance from the jurisprudence of making distinction between disbelief of the alibi or proof of its falsity the distinction being that if the trial judge disbelieves the alibi, it is treated as if it had not been given, whereas proof of falsehood leads the trial judge to an inference of guilt. [7] I do, however, draw an adverse inference against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by perjury. do not view the accused's letter as an attempt by an innocent man to protect himself against wrongful conviction by system that is skewed by police and prosecutorial misconduct (as stated by the accused in his letter). I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the purpose of the accused in formulating his letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry. That portion of his letter ""so if somehow Crown could proof[sic] wasn't at Eureka, or you weren't at Eureka, they'd have to tell my lawyer"" leaves me in no doubt about the intentions of the accused nor in any doubt about his whereabouts at the time of the robbery. His letter is direct evidence that he was not at the Eureka Club at the time of the robbery and is corroboration for the identification evidence of Robert Hanson. [8] The adverse inference which have drawn against the accused is independent evidence which corroborates the evidence of Mr. Hanson. make this connection corroboration as matter of common sense. adopt the reasoning of Mr. Justice de Grandpré in R. v. Warketin, Hanson and Brown (1976), 1976 CanLII 190 (SCC), 30 C.C.C. (2d) (S.C.C.) wherein he said at p. 16: Corroboration is not word of art. It is matter of common sense. In recent years, this Court has repeatedly refused to give narrow legalistic reading of that word and to impose upon trial Judges artificial restraints in their instructions to juries or to themselves... He later observed at p. 18-19: This treatment of corroboration as matter of common sense, the purpose of which is to ensure that no conviction will be entered if there is reasonable doubt as to the guilt, is not restricted to Canada. It is sufficient for my purpose to refer to two recent decisions of the House of Lords, namely: Director of Public Prosecutions v. Hester, [1972] All E.R. 1056, and Director of Public Prosecutions v. Kilbourne, [1973] All E.R. 440. From the headnote of this last case, extract two sentences: The word ""corroboration"" had no special technical meaning; by itself it meant no more than evidence tending to confirm other evidence. No distinction could, therefore, be drawn between evidence which could be used as corroboration and evidence which might help the jury to determine the truth of the matter. [9] I view the evidence of Mr. Hanson to be direct evidence to prove the accused\'s identity, and the accused\'s letter is corroborative evidence of such a nature that leads me to a reasoned conclusion that Mr. Hanson correctly identified the accused in the photo ID line-up. Mr. Hanson testified that he was visited by the robber on two occasions, first in the early evening when he drove to the service station on his motorcycle. Mr. Hanson had an opportunity to look at his face on that occasion; he was wearing helmet with no visor or mouth guard. That occasion was remarkable because the motorcyclist dismounted his motorcycle and asked Mr. Hanson few questions, including whether he had telephone, but did not purchase anything. few hours later, the same motorcyclist reappeared, dismounted the same motorcycle at the same location and ordered some cigarettes and chips. While Mr. Hanson was filling the order, the motorcyclist appeared with knife in his right hand which was pointed at Mr. Hanson's stomach. The robber demanded money; Mr. Hanson complied. Mr. Hanson asked him why he was doing it; to which the robber replied ""desperate"". Mr. Hanson observed the robber's face, knife and clothing, and testified that it was important to ""get description of the individual"". As soon as the robber left, he called the police. He judged the robber to be between 5'7"" and 5'9"" in height, with blue eyes which were bloodshot, wearing cut-off tee shirt (grey) and jeans. He testified that the robber's hair was blonde/reddish. He did not notice scar on the arm of the robber but said that he would not have noticed it in the circumstances. [10] It is understandable that Mr. Hanson did not observe the scar on the accused's arm in those frightful circumstances since his attention was directed primarily on the robber's face and knife. Mr. Hanson testified that there were not lot of customers that evening. Subsequently, on November 4, 1998, Mr. Hanson was shown photo ID line-up by Sergeant Smith of the Regina City Police who telephoned earlier to advise that he would be attending. Mr. Hanson testified that Sergeant Smith said that the police had someone who they thought had committed the crime, although Sergeant Smith was careful to instruct Mr. Hanson not to jump at anything and cautioned him that the person may not be in the line-up. Indeed, the photographic line-up instructions were entered as Exhibit P-2; both Mr. Hanson and Sergeant Smith testified that there were no other instructions or suggestions given to Mr. Hanson who signed the declaration to that effect on Exhibit P-2 which also indicated that he had read over the following instructions, namely: 1. The person who committed the crime may or may not be in the group of photographs. 2. You are in no way obliged to select anyone. 3. Study each photograph carefully before making any comments. Consider that the photographs could be old or new, that hairstyles change and that persons can alter their appearance by growing or shaving facial hair. [11] Mr. Hanson readily identified the accused's photograph from the photo ID line-up which consisted of eight photographs in total and he commented on the instruction sheet ""The face is the one that remember"". These photographs are black and white and obviously do not show hair and eye colour. The photo ID line-up shown to Mr. Hanson does not contain the names and dates of anyone in the line-up or any other particulars and is produced by digital system which has been used by the police service for long time. Sergeant Smith testified that he utilizes the black and white photos in order to make it more difficult for witnesses. [12] The day following his interview with Mr. Hanson, Sergeant Smith attended at the Provincial Correction Centre to arrest the accused and noted that he matched the initial description given by Mr. Hanson to the police at the time of the robbery. During cross-examination, Sergeant Smith testified that he received the file approximately two months after the robbery and that he could be characterized as the investigating officer at the time he prepared the photo ID line-up. Sergeant Smith and Mr. Hanson are credible witnesses and am satisfied that the integrity of the identification system employed was maintained. Sergeant Smith showed the photo ID line-up to Mr. Hanson's girlfriend who was also in the small kiosk at the time of the robbery. She was behind Mr. Hanson who was standing between her and the robber. Although she had clear view of the robber, am certain that her opportunity for observation of his facial features was less than that of Mr. Hanson who had seen the robber approximately two hours previously. In any event, she did not pick out the accused from the photo ID line-up take that as being supportive of the integrity of the identification system employed by Sergeant Smith but do not attach any great importance to her evidence because of the circumstances of the robbery. [13] Neither Mr. Hanson nor his girlfriend were able to identify the accused at his preliminary inquiry or at his trial. At trial, the accused was clean shaven but the defence photograph taken within one month of the trial shows him with prominent mustache slightly reddish. The black and white photograph identified by Mr. Hanson shows the accused without mustache. Mr. Hanson reported to the police, at the time, that the robber had mustache. take Mr. Hanson's girlfriend's failure to identify the accused as evidence supportive of the integrity of the system. Considering and weighing the evidence of the description of the robber given by Mr. Hanson and his girlfriend to the police at the time, the evidence related in court by each of those witnesses, the photograph of the accused identified by Mr. Hanson in the photo ID line-up, the photograph of the accused tendered as defence evidence, and the appearance of the accused in court (no mustache), have no reasonable doubt that Mr. Hanson identified the accused as being the robber. [14] In assessing the evidence of Mr. Hanson, am satisfied that he looked at the accused directly and without obstruction for period of several minutes at very close distance. There was nothing which obstructed his view nor was there anything else which was happening at the time which my have distracted him except, obviously, for the holding of the knife by the accused and Mr. Hanson's compliance with his instruction to give him money. Mr. Hanson appears to have good eyesight and memory. Mr. Hanson immediately notified the police on the telephone and gave good description of the accused. During the course of his testimony at the preliminary inquiry and at the trial, Mr. Hanson did make some change to the description of the accused but it was not significant. Mr. Hanson's girlfriend gave similar description but she was unable to identify the accused from the photo ID line-up some three and one-half months after the robbery. attach more weight to Mr. Hanson's evidence since he had an opportunity to observe the accused prior to the robbery when the accused first came to the gas station approximately two hours before the robbery. On that occasion, the accused acted out of the ordinary and Mr. Hanson recalls the conversation with the accused at that time in detail. During the robbery, Mr. Hanson and the robber were face to face. Mr. Hanson did not see photograph of the accused before he made the identification of the accused in the photo ID line-up and am satisfied that his selection of the accused from the photo ID line-up was from his memory of the person who committed the offence. [15] During able cross-examination of Mr. Hanson, he did admit certain discrepancies in his evidence at trial from previous evidence at the preliminary inquiry, but am satisfied that the discrepancies were minor in nature and did not affect the central issue of the identity of the accused. For example, Mr. Hanson testified that the accused was not wearing glasses at the time of the robbery whereas at the preliminary inquiry he said that he could not remember. Also, during cross-examination, Mr. Hanson agreed that his memory was not as good at the time of the photo ID line-up as it was at the time of the robbery but he added that ""you don't forget face like that"". And yet he did not identify the accused who was in the prisoner's docket at the preliminary inquiry and at trial (having been remanded in custody). The accused did not have mustache at trial, but he did not have mustache in the photo ID line-up either. do not find Mr. Hanson's failure to identify the accused at the preliminary inquiry (eight months after the robbery) nor at trial (eleven months after the robbery) to be reason to suspect or reject his evidence that he identified the accused in the photo ID line-up three and one-half months after the robbery and gave an accurate description to the police immediately at the time of the robbery. However, this evidence does not stand alone and is buttressed and supported by the adverse inference which have drawn from the contents of the letter of the accused made within month of his trial. [16] have no reasonable doubt that the motorcyclist (on the first occasion), the motorcyclist on the second occasion, the robber, the person reported to the police at the time, and the person identified in the photo ID line-up by Mr. Hanson approximately three and one-half months thereafter, are the same person the accused. [17] In weighing the entirety of the letter, have concluded that it is tantamount to an admission by the accused that he was not at the Eureka Club at the time of the robbery, and that he attempted to manufacture an alibi by eliciting false testimony from potential witness. There is no other explanation in evidence for the purpose of the request for the false evidence to be given; the defence asserts that the accused, as an experienced criminal, knows that he may be wrongfully convicted unless he comes up with an alibi and, ergo, the intention of the accused was pure that is, to ensure that an innocent man would not be wrongfully convicted. The defence urges that the letter may be construed in that light. am satisfied that the sole reason for the intended fabrication was to deceive the court; there is no other express or inferred explanation in evidence. The admission by the accused that he was not at the Eureka Club at the time of the robbery, taken together with his knowledge of all of the circumstances of the offence and his plan to meet that evidence at trial by fabricating evidence, warrants an adverse inference against him which, together with the identification facts which have been proved, leads to the reasonable and just conclusion that the accused is the person who committed the robbery. have not drawn this inference with mathematical certainty, but am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by all of the evidence that the accused is the perpetrator of the robbery, and that all of the other elements of the Indictment have been proven beyond reasonable doubt as well, that is, that the accused stole money from Domo Gas while armed with an offensive weapon. [18] Accordingly, I find the accused guilty as charged in the Indictment.",4_1999canlii12738.txt,"The accused is on trial for armed robbery and the central issue is identity.

(orally) [1] The proposed appellants applied to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal of a Court of Queen’s Bench trial judge’s order awarding costs to the proposed respondent payable by Spelliscy and Tapp, jointly and personally. They propose to appeal essentially on the basis the award was punitive and inordinately high. [2] had orally refused to grant the extension for the reason saw little chance of success on appeal. Counsel for the proposed respondent advised the court the cost award was based on costs thrown away after the trial judge ordered mistrial because of the prejudice caused by the proposed appellants’ address to the jury. Counsel further advised the Court there was an affidavit filed before the Queen’s Bench trial judge setting out the costs and expenses. [3] Subsequently, counsel for the proposed respondent filed the memorandum of argument for costs filed below. It did not contain an affidavit but did detail the expenses, fees and hours of work, some of which will be used at the new trial. Because there was no affidavit as claimed the proposed appellants argue there was no evidentiary foundation for the award and asked for rehearing of the application.

Franey for the appellant John Underhill for the respondent Children’s Aid Society of Halifax Respondent S.F. not appearing Application Heard: July 25, 2002 Applicant’s brief August 16, 2002 Respondent Society’s brief August 30, 2002 Decision Delivered: September 5, 2002 BEFORE THE HONOURABLE JUSTICE CROMWELL IN CHAMBERS PUBLISHERS OF THIS CASE PLEASE TAKE NOTE THAT s. 94(1) OF THE CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT APPLIES AND MAY REQUIRE EDITING OF THIS JUDGMENT OR ITS HEADING BEFORE PUBLICATION. SECTION 94(1) PROVIDES: 94(1) No person shall publish or make public information that has the effect of identifying child who is witness at or participant in hearing or the subject of proceeding pursuant to this Act, or parent or guardian, foster parent or relative of the child. CROMWELL, J.A.: (in Chambers) I. Introduction: [1] R.B. applies to me in Chambers for an order that she be added as a party so that she can appeal a permanent care order respecting her granddaughter. [2] R.B. is the paternal grandmother of two and one-half year old L.T.F. L.T.F. was the subject of protection proceedings brought by the Children’s Aid Society of Halifax in the Family Division. R.B. did not participate in those proceedings. She says she had indicated to the Society that she was willing to be considered as placement for the child if the plan to return the child to her mother did not progress as anticipated. In the end, the proceedings resulted, in June of this year, in an order placing the child in the permanent care and custody of the Children’s Aid Society of Halifax. According to R.B., she found out about the order after the fact. She feels that the Society wrongly shut her out of the process and that the judge in the Family Division erred in not considering family placement with her before making the permanent care order. [3] The application raises two issues. The first is whether I, sitting as judge in Court of Appeal Chambers, have the authority to deal with the application. The second is whether R.B. should be added as party for the purposes of bringing an appeal. [4] Having considered the helpful briefs of counsel and the authorities, I am of the view that a judge of the Court of Appeal in Chambers does not have authority to make the order requested. Even if I had jurisdiction to do so, I would not make the order as, in my opinion, an application to the Family Division for leave to terminate the permanent care order appears likely to be a more appropriate initial way for R.B. to proceed. I, therefore, dismiss the application. II. Adding Parties for the Purposes of Pursuing an Appeal: [5] R.B. submits that there are two bases on which this Court may add her as party for the purposes of appealing the permanent care order. will briefly outline the submissions with respect to each of them. [6] The first is found in ss. 36(1)(f), 31 and 49 of the Children and Family Services Act, S.N.S. 1990, c. as amended. Under s. 31, the definition of proceeding in the Act includes an appeal to this Court of permanent care order made in the Family Division. Section 36 defines party to proceeding as including “... any other person added as party at any stage in the proceeding pursuant to the Family Court Rules”. It is argued that the provision in s. 36, which authorizes the addition of party at any stage of the proceeding, includes the power of this Court to add party for the purposes of an appeal. [7] The second basis on which R.B. says there is jurisdiction to add party for the purposes of appealing is the preserved inherent jurisdiction of this Court. In Société des Acadiens du Nouveau-Brunswick Inc. and the Association des conseillers scolaires francophones du Nouveau-Brunswick v. Association of Parents for Fairness in Education, Grand Falls District 50 Branch, 1986 CanLII 66 (SCC), [1986] S.C.R. 549, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the New Brunswick Court of Appeal had inherited the authority of the High Court of Chancery in England to add party for the purposes of bringing an appeal from decision in which that party had an interest. Briefly put, R.B.’s submission is that this Court is in the same position as the New Brunswick Court of Appeal. [8] The Children’s Aid Society contests the jurisdiction of this Court or judge to make the order sought. However, in light of the conclusions that have reached, need not decide whether the Court has the authority on either or both of the bases advanced by R.B. to add party for the purposes of appealing. To consider the authority of Chambers judge will assume, without deciding, that this Court has that authority. The question, then, is whether judge in Chambers may exercise the power of the Court in this situation. III. Jurisdiction of Chambers Judge: [9] In general, all the powers of the Court of Appeal are exercised by panel of at least three judges. The powers exercisable by one judge of the Court in Chambers are limited to the matters assigned to Chambers judge under Rule 62 or any other Rule or enactment: see Rule 62.24 and Future Inns Canada lnc. v. Nova Scotia (Labour Relations Board) (1996), 1996 CanLII 5240 (NS CA), 154 N.S.R. (2d) 358; N.S.J. No. 434 (Q.L.)(N.S.C.A. Chambers). [10] R.B. submits that Chambers judge generally has authority to deal with procedural matters and the addition of party for the purposes of bringing an appeal is such matter. Even accepting that this rather significant step is procedural matter, the power of Chambers judge in this Court is not dependent on the distinction between matters of procedure and matters of substance. The Chambers judge’s authority, while mainly procedural in nature, depends on specific authority found in the applicable Rules or enactments. [11] If there is an inherent power, derived from English Chancery practice, to add party for the purposes of bringing an appeal, this preserved inherent jurisdiction is that of the Court, not one judge of the Court. In the New Brunswick case cited earlier, Court of Appeal Chambers judge decided that under New Brunswick practice, the inherent jurisdiction to add party for the purposes of appealing should be exercised only by the Court. Assuming (without deciding) that our Court has similar inherent power, there is no rule or enactment to which have been referred which authorizes judge in Chambers to exercise it. [12] R.B. relies on Rule 62.01(j) which defines “respondent” to include “any person, who ... is authorized by the Court or Judge to be party to the appeal...”. do not think this assists R.B.’s position. Putting aside that she seeks to become an appellant, not respondent, Rule 62.01(j) is purely definition provision and should not be interpreted as conferring jurisdiction. [13] If the power to add party derives from the provisions of the Children and Family Services Act, cannot read them as conferring any power to do so on judge of the Court of Appeal. In general, the powers of the Family Court and the Family Division of the Supreme Court are exercised by judge thereof. However, as noted, generally the powers of the Court of Appeal are exercised by panel of at least three judges. In my opinion, if s. 36 confers the authority to make the order asked for by R.B., the authority is conferred on the Court, not on Chambers judge. [14] R.B. argues by analogy from the jurisdiction of Chambers judge to permit intervention on appeal. In my view, however, the jurisdiction of Chambers judge of this Court depends on an express or implied grant of power in rule or enactment and not on analogy. Moreover, the authority of judge to permit intervention was controversial before the amendment of the Rules to expressly permit it, and the amendment did not extend to empowering judge to add party for the purposes of appealing: see Conrad v. Snair (1995), 1995 CanLII 8960 (NS CA), 142 N.S.R. (2d) 224; N.S.J. No. 622 (Q.L.)(N.S.C.A. Chambers); 1874000 Nova Scotia Ltd. v. Adams (1996), 1996 CanLII 5243 (NS CA), 156 N.S.R. (2d) 208; N.S.J. No. 456 (Q.L.)(N.S.C.A. Chambers); Labourers’ International Union Local 1115 v. Dexter Construction Co. (1999), 1999 NSCA 132 (CanLII), 180 N.S.R. (2d) 129; N.S.J. No. 370 (Q.L.)(N.S.C.A. Chambers); Rule 62.35. [15] conclude that do not have jurisdiction to add R.B. as party for the purposes of appealing the permanent care order. IV. Discretion: [16] If Chambers judge had jurisdiction to make the order sought by R.B., that authority would be discretionary one. For number of practical reasons, would be very reluctant to exercise the discretion given that there appears to me to be more appropriate route for R.B. to seek redress initially in this situation. [17] It seems likely that R.B. may be able to seek party status for the purposes of seeking leave to apply in the Family Division for an order terminating the permanent care order: see Children’s Aid Society of Shelburne County v. I.C. (2001), 2001 NSCA 108 (CanLII), 196 N.S.R. (2d) 70; N.S.J. No 260; 2001 NSCA 108. If this is so, that approach would be immensely preferable to adding party for the purposes of an appeal. [18] The Family Division not only has intimate knowledge of the permanent care proceedings, but is better equipped to deal with the evidentiary matters which are likely to arise in the course of R.B.’s attempts to place her position before the Court. The Family Division would also be in the position to deal with the permanent care order on its merits whereas this Court, if persuaded that R.B’s plan for the child should have been heard and considered, would most likely find it necessary to remit the matter to the Family Division for evaluation of her plan for the child. This would add to delay which the Children and Family Services Act tries to avoid. [19] While there might be particular circumstances in which judge of this Court, if he or she had jurisdiction, would make the order sought, there is nothing in the material filed that would persuade me to do so in this case. [20] should add that it is apparent from the material filed that there are number of issues of fact surrounding R.B’s involvement with the child and the proceedings as well as the Society’s communications with her. Nothing which have said in these reasons should be taken as deciding any of these factual issues. V. Disposition: [21] In the result, the application is dismissed.

No.
59 (hereinafter the “Union”) commenced this action under the simplified procedure of Part 40 of The Queen’s Bench Rules, seeking judgment for $50,000.
This Bylaw shall cover Executive officers of Local 59 only.
3) The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause.
The plaintiff had been president of the Union for roughly 10 years when he was defeated in an election for that office in 2000.
A recount was requested but the result was confirmed.
Several months later, the position of vice-president was in contest and the plaintiff put his name forward.
5) Defeat did not rest easily with the plaintiff and he again proffered his name for election for the position of Reclassification Chair, in an election to be held in September, 2000.
6) From the moment the plaintiff was defeated in his bid for the presidency in 2000, his relationship with the executive of the Union became rancorous.
The plaintiff was constantly engaging the Union’s various officers in procedural objections and debates.
8) Litigation of the type brought by the plaintiff was new to the Union.","The accused was charged with first degree murder.
Prior to jury selection, he applied for a stay of proceedings, alleging that there had been a breach of his right to a fair trial due to negative pre-trial publicity.
Dismissing the application,
that the application was premature.
However, the accused would be permitted to challenge potential jurors for cause due to the highly prejudicial and inflammatory pre-trial media reports.","[6, 1, 5, 3, 0, 9, 15, 16, 13, 10, 24, 11]",526,"C.R.141404 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN DANY KANE DECISION ON APPLICATION FOR STAY OF PROCEEDINGS HEARD: at Sackville, Nova Scotia before the Honourable Justice Felix A. Cacchione on September 23rd, 1998 DECISION: September 28th, 1998 (Orally) COUNSEL: Pierre Lapointe and Chris Morris, for the Crown Dani6le Roy and Isabelle LaMarche, for the Defence (Applicant) J. The accused, Dany Kane, is charged with murder in the first degree. He did not have the benefit of preliminary inquiry as result of the Crown preferring the indictment against him. There is no evidence before the court on the merits of the case as the trial has yet to begin. The accused brings this application for a stay of proceedings alleging that his rights under ss.11(d) and 11 (f) of Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms have been infringed due to the pre-trial publicity generated by this case. The applicants position, in short, is that the pre-trial publicity has prejudiced his right to be tried by an impartial jury of his peers. It is also argued that the security measures presently in place and focussed on by the media have instilled in the general populous climate of fear which makes the selection of an impartial jury impossible. It is argued by the applicant that prejudicial information, which has yet to be ruled admissible by this Court, is contained in many of the media reports aired to date. Reference is made to the following prejudicial comments contained in the news report; (a) the description of Mr. Kane as the accused killer not the alleged accused killer, (b) to Mr. Kane having links with the Hells Angels Motorcycle Gang; (c) to Quebec bikers being notorious for bombings; (d) to an incident during biker trial held in Montreal where car was driven up the courthouse steps; (e) to the RCMP belief that this case was contract killing involving the Hells Angels; (f) to the police taking extra precautions because the case is linked to bikers; (g) to the police saying the accused has ties to violent faction of the Hells Angels; (h) to the accused being transported by three van loads of heavily armed RCMP officers; (i) the escorting of the handcuffed accused into the courthouse. As well it is submitted that coverage about this trial being held in location other that the Law Courts Building together with the extensive security arrangements in place, such as cement barricades surrounding the building, external surveillance cameras, metal detectors, twenty-four hour per day perimeter patrols by civilian clothed RCMP officers and the transportation of the accused to the courthouse by what the media describes as heavily-armed guards travelling in bullet-proof vehicles have made it impossible for this accused to be tried by an impartial jury of his peers. The appellant's position is that the comments noted above coupled with very brief interview of two persons living near the make-shift courthouse who indicate that they are nervous because of the heightened security have made it impossible for the accused to receive fair trial. The applicant argues that these eight television news broadcasts aired at peak times on September 10th, 11 th, 15th, 16th and 17th together with five radio broadcasts aired on September 15th and 16th have created an atmosphere of fear and terror surrounding Mr. Kane's trial such that it will be impossible for him to get fair trial by an impartial jury. The applicant submits that this information is such that it would reasonably be expected to taint the accused in the eyes of the public and that potential jury has been irreparably prejudiced against him. It is the applicant's position that there is reasonable apprehension of bias such that Mr. Kane's rights have been or may be infringed. The Crown respondent acknowledges that the incident in Montreal where car was driven up the steps of the courthouse was not linked to the Hells Angels and that the reporting of this link is clearly wrong. The respondent argues essentially two points, these being: (a) that the applicant has not discharged its burden of proving on balance of probabilities that his Charter rights have been breached; and (b) that the application is premature because no attempt has been made to determine if an impartial jury can be selected. The respondent's position is that it is insufficient to simply say that there has been adverse publicity and therefore the applicant cannot receive fair trial because of that publicity. The respondent submits that the test is what effect has this publicity had on potential jurors and whether that effect is such that it precludes potential jurors from putting aside their preconceptions and judging the case on its merits. It is suggested that simply because two persons living near the courthouse have been made nervous by the visible security arrangements does not necessarily mean that all potential jurors will suffer that same effect to the point of not being impartial. It is clear that some of the pre-trial publicity has covered things which were factually wrong or things which have not, to-date, been established in evidence. It is also true that the media coverage has been sensational and inflammatory by focussing on the security arrangements presently in place. However, the pre-trial publicity generated in this case pales in comparison to the media coverage preceding the criminal trial in the Westray Disaster and in the trials of the Christian Brothers involved in the Mount Cashel abuse cases. In R. v. Kenny (1991), 1991 CanLII 2738 (NL SC), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 36 the accused was charged as result of incidents occurring at Mount Cashel. He applied for Stay of Proceedings on the basis of adverse pre-trial publicity. In his ruling on this application Barry, J. outlined the type of media coverage which preceded the commencement of Mr. Kenny's trial. Justice Barry noted that public inquiry, held before Mr. Kenny's trial, heard from twenty former residents of Mount Cashel who testified under relaxed rules of evidence about the abuse they suffered at Mount Cashel at the hands of various members of the Christian Brothers organization. The vast majority of the public inquiry was broadcast on cable television network covering 83% of the households in the area from which jury panel was to be selected. He noted as well that the story of the Mount Cashel abuse including video taped portions of the inquiry testimony of abuse victims was played and re-played both locally and nationally throughout the period from the commencement of the inquiry through to the date of Mr. Kenny's trial. In two year period leading up to Mr. Kenny's trial, in Newfoundland alone, there were 525 news stories involving 330,000 words relating to the abuse at Mount Cashel. Stay of Proceedings based on the unprecedented amount of prejudicial pre-trial publicity was denied in that case. The issues before me are: (a) has the appellant established on balance of probabilities that the circumstances of this case violate his right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal under s.11(d) or his right to jury trial under s.11(f) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; and (b) if there has been violation of the accused's Charter rights is the proper remedy Stay of Proceedings. THE LAW It is well noted that in Charter cases the burden of establishing Charter violation rests with the applicant on balance of probabilities. R. v. Mack (1988), 44 C.C.C. (d) 513. The law applicable to Stay of Proceedings applications is clear and has been set out in various decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada commencing with R. v. Jewitt (1985), 1985 CanLII 47 (SCC), 21 C.C.C. (3d) 7; R. v. Keyowski (1988), 1988 CanLII 74 (SCC), 40 C.C.C. (3d) 481; R. v. Conway (1989), 1989 CanLII 66 (SCC), 49 C.C.C. (3d) 289; R. v. Scott (1990), 1990 CanLII 27 (SCC), 61 C.C.C. (3d) 300; R. v. Potvin (1993) 1993 CanLII 113 (SCC), 83 C. C. C. (3d) 97; R. v. Power (1994), 1994 CanLII 126 (SCC), 89 C. C. C. (3d) and R. v. O'Connor (1995), 1995 CanLII 51 (SCC), 103 C.C.C. (3d) 1. In R. v. O'Connor the Supreme Court of Canada indicated that there was no utility in maintaining two distinct approaches to abusive conduct. Both the majority and minority judgments are in agreement that the concept of abuse of process has been subsumed in the Charter and should not be considered separately unless circumstances arise to which the Charter does not apply. The above noted authorities hold that Stay should be granted where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency or where proceedings are vexatious or oppressive. It is also established that Stay of Proceedings should only be entered in ""the clearest of cases"". In R. v. Conway it was held that where the affront to decency and fair play is disproportionate to the societal interest in the effective prosecution of criminal cases then the administration is best served by staying the proceedings. Justice L'Heureux-Dube in R. v. Power stated at page 10 that courts have residual discretion to remedy an abuse of process only in the clearest of cases. She described those cases as being ""conduct which shocks the conscience of the community and is so detrimental to the proper administration of justice that it would warrant judicial intervention."" Further on she states what is required for situation to be deemed the ""clearest of cases"". To conclude that the situation 'is tainted to such degree' and that it amounts to one of the 'clearest of cases', as the abuse of process has been characterized by the jurisprudence, requires overwhelming evidence that the proceedings under scrutiny are unfair to the point that they are contrary to the interests of justice .... Where there is conspicuous evidence of improper motives of bad faith or of an act so wrong that it violates the conscience of the community, such that it would genuinely be unfair and decent to proceed, then, and only then, should courts intervene to prevent an abuse of process which could bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Cases of this nature will be extremely rare.' In R. v. Sherratt (1991), 1991 CanLII 86 (SCC), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) L'Heureux-Dube stated at page 204: The perceived importance of the jury and the Charter right to jury trial is meaningless without some guarantee that it will perform its duties impartially and represent, as far as is possible and appropriate in the circumstances, the larger community. Indeed, without the two characteristics of impartiality and respensentativeness, jury would be unable to perform properly many of the functions that make its existence desireable in the first place."" The Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Valente (1985), 1985 CanLII 25 (SCC), 23 C.C.C. (3d) 193 has stated that the test for independence and impartiality is the reasonable apprehension of bias. Has the pre-trial publicity generated in this case caused reasonable apprehension of bias? It may well be that at this stage there is an apprehension of bias but the question is whether that apprehension is reasonable. As was stated by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Hubbert (1975) 1975 CanLII 53 (ON CA), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 279 at page 289: ""...There is an initial presumption that juror not disqualified by the statute under which he is selected, will perform his duties in accordance with his oath."" The Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Sherratt referring with approval to the Ontario Court of Appeal decision in R, v. Hubbert stated at page 206: ""Impartiality is state of mind to be tested at the time of the swearing-in of each juror."" As of this date it is impossible to say whether an impartial jury can be selected because no potential jurors have been questioned on the effect of pre-trial publicity on their impartiality. In R. v. Vermette 1988 CanLII 87 (SCC), [1988] S.C.R. 985 case which involved exceptional pre-trial media publicity given to the statements of very popular Quebec Premier made in the National Assembly about matter then before the courts and about the credibility of witnesses the Supreme Court of Canada determined that Stay of Proceedings in that case was premature. At page 992 LaForest, J. stated: "".. It is only at the stage when the jury is to be selected that it will be possible to determine whether the respondent can be tried by an impartial jury... In deciding the question, one must not, in my view, rely on speculation... In an extreme case (and the present certainly qualifies), such publicity should lead to challenge for cause at trial, but am far from thinking that it must necessarily be assumed that person subjected to such publicity will necessarily be biased."" am satisfied that in the present case the pre-trial publicity, filled as it is with prejudicial and inflammatory information has lead to an apprehension of bias. However am also of the opinion that until it is known to what extent this information has affected ­potential jurors, the issue remains speculative. Has that publicity so irreparably prejudiced potential jurors or so impaired the presumption of innocence that it is impossible to say that fair trial can be held? As of this writing there is no evidence that this has happened. It will only be at the stage of jury selection that this can be determined. Simply because there has been adverse publicity does not necessarily mean that fair trial cannot be held. As stated by Cory, J. in Phillips v. Nova Scotia (Commission of Inquiry into the Westray Mine Tragedy) (1995), 1995 CanLII 86 (SCC), 98 C. C. C. (3d) 20 at p. 71: "".. The alleged partiality of jurors can only be measured in the context of the highly developed system of safeguards which have evolved in order to prevent just such problem. Only when these safeguards are inadequate to guarantee impartiality will s.11(d) be breached."" In Phillips Cory, J. makes the valid point that impartiality cannot be equated with ignorance of all the facts of the case. He makes the following observation at p. 71. ""...A definition of an impartial juror today must take into account not only all our present methods of communication and news reporting techniques, but also the heightened protection of individual rights which has existed in this country since the introduction of the Charter in 1982. It comes down to this: in order to hold fair trial it must be possible to find jurors who, although familiar with the case, are able to discard any previously formed opinions and to embark upon their duties armed with both an assumption that the accused is innocent until proven otherwise, and willingness to determine liability based solely on the evidence presented at trial."" At p. 72 Justice Cory catalogues the safeguards he previously referred to as: The solemnity of the juror's oath, the existence of procedures such as change of venue and challenge for cause, and the careful attention which jurors pay to the instructions of judge all help to ensure that jurors will carry out their duties impartially. In rare cases, sufficient proof that these safeguards are not likely to prevent juror bias may warrant some form of relief being granted under s.24(1) of the Charter."" In my opinion to this list can also be added the safeguard jury unanimity and peremptory challenges. Justice Cory notes that relief will not be granted on speculation alone and that the proper time for assessing whether the accused's s.11(d) rights have been violated is at the time of jury selection. As stated in R. v. O'Connor at p. 41 ""A Stay of proceedings is last resort, to be taken when all other acceptable avenues of protecting the accused's right to full answer and defence are exhausted."" Although v. O'Connor dealt with violation of the accused's s.7 Charter rights due to non disclosure, the principle enunciated is equally applicable to situation involving an accused's 11 (d) and (f) rights. In my opinion the Applicant in the present case has not established on balance of probabilities that his right to fair trial by an impartial jury has been violated. What the applicant has established is that challenges for cause are desirable and I will permit counsel to challenge prospective jurors for cause should counsel so wish providing that a list of proposed questions is presented to the Court for it perusal by 930 a.m. Thursday October 1 st, 1998. It may be that such an exercise will lead to the discovery that noimpartial jurors can be found, but until this exercise is attempted we are left with mere speculation as to the effect of the pre-trial publicity. Accordingly the application for a stay of proceedings is dismissed.",7_1998canlii2924.txt,"The accused was charged with first degree murder.

May 6, 1997The plaintiff, S.S. Johnson Seeds Ltd. (""Johnson Seeds""), claims damages from the defendant, Barry Farr (""Farr""), for an alleged breach of contract.
Johnson Seeds is a Manitoba corporation, and operates out of Arborg, Manitoba, and currently has approximately 20 employees.
Johnson Seeds purchases specialty crops from producers and contracts with purchasers, including other traders or packagers, for the resale of these specialty crops.
To secure the product for resale, Johnson Seeds will enter into contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting of the same.
Always some flexibility is needed as the purchaser may alter the delivery times.
As well, the crops must be cleaned to meet the delivery standard required and Johnson Seeds must organize the operation of the processing plant to meet the needs of the purchasers.
Johnson Seeds has limited storage capacity so it is not possible for Johnson to take delivery from the growers as soon as the crops are harvested.","The deceased's cousin commenced an action for nervous shock after she observed the accident in which the deceased bicyclist was killed.
Since the defendant was an uninsured motorist, the Facility Association defended the plaintiff's action against him; however, the plaintiff also brought an action against the insurer of a motor vehicle policy under which the deceased was insured.
At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff.
The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.","[1, 0, 3, 4, 5, 2, 12, 9, 10, 14, 6, 7, 13]",86,"IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA Citation: Jones v.

No. 191874 Registry: Pictou Between: Deborah Jones, Reginald Brightman, Alicia Hartling, an infant, through her Litigation Guardian Carol Hartling, John Hartling, Diane Hartling, Edward Hartling, James Lawrence and Sharon Lawrence v. Joseph Gerard LeBlanc and Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company Defendants Judge: The Honourable Justice Charles E. Haliburton Heard: April 4, 2006, in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia Written Decision: April 26, 2006 Counsel: Jamie MacGillilvray, for the Plaintiffs John Kulik, for the Facility Association for and on behalf of the Defendant LeBlanc Robert M. Purdy, Q. C. for the Defendant, Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company By the Court: [1] All issues in this proceeding have been settled except to determine liability between Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company and the Facility Association for psychological injury suffered by Alicia Hartling. [2] An Agreed Statement of Facts has been filed by the parties and now set it forth: 1. This action arises out of a motor vehicle / bicycle accident whichoccurred on June 27, 2002. The late Jonathan Hartling was driving his bicycle on the road when he was struck from behind and killed. 2. The Plaintiff Alicia Hartling was Jonathan Hartling’s cousin. She was present, although she did not suffer any physical injuries and was not directly involved in the accident, she commenced this action to advance a claim for nervous shock. It is admitted that the Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for nervous shock from the Defendant LeBlanc. 3. Since the Defendant LeBlanc was an uninsured motorist at the time of the accident, the Plaintiff’s claim against LeBlanc is being defended by the Facility Association which maintains the Uninsured Motorist Claims Fund for Nova Scotia. 4. The Plaintiff claims against the Defendant Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company pursuant to the Section D Uninsured Automobile Coverage provisions of policy number 0875153 issued by Wawanesa to Reginald Brightman, the step-father of the Late Jonathan Hartling. 5. Jonathan Hartling was “person insured under the contract”. 6. Alicia Hartling was neither resident of nor dependant of the Brightman household, therefore, it is agreed that the Plaintiff Alicia was not “person insured under the contract”. 7. The Plaintiff’s claim has been settled between the parties. The trial of this matter was held at New Glasgow on April 4th, 2006 for argument only. The Plaintiff did not participate and has no interest of the outcome, the Facility Association and Wawanesa having together settled her claim. psychological report on file discloses another fact that might have affected Alicia’s emotional well being. It says “Alicia recounts that she saw Jonathan’s bike flying past her and that she stopped and “looked everywhere for Jonathan but could not find him”. In panic, she rode down to her house to find her father and then they both returned to the accident site to look for Jonathan. Jonathan was found about 100 feet away from where he was hit. It was subsequently determined he was dead.” ISSUE [3] Do the Section D provisions of the M/V Insurance policy issued by Wawanesa extend to protect Alicia Hartling, who suffered psychic injury as a result of the “injury or death” of Jonathan Hartling, an “insured person” under the policy? [4] It is Section 139 of the Insurance Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 231 that mandates what is known as “Section D” coverage in all M/V insurance contracts. Disposing of the issue between the two Insurers requires an interpretation of that section and an analysis or characterization of the claim. It is common ground that if Ms. Hartling had suffered physical injury as direct result of the negligence of the uninsured LeBlanc then the Facility Association would have been obliged to respond. Unlike her cousin Jonathan, she is not “person insured under the contract” and hence her physical injuries and the claim arising therefrom would not be actionable under the Wawanesa policy. [5] It is submitted on behalf of Wawanesa that Section 139 (2) (b) provides for recovery against the Section Insurer in the present circumstances by only that class of person’s who are entitled to recover under the Fatal Injuries Act (that is close relatives). It is those persons who are entitled to recover damages for “the death of person insured”. Such claim, it is argued, arises through the death of Jonathan Hartling, the insured person; whereas the claim advanced by Alicia Hartling “is an independent tort” and must be founded upon different basis. As put by Wawanesa’s counsel “she was not “person insured under the contract”. Wawanesa’s Section Coverage does not extend to her claim.” [6] Mr. Kulik, for the Facility Association has argued that plaintiff (next of kin) should be obliged to sue only one defendant to obtain full recovery. It should not be made necessary to sue Wawanesa under the Fatal Injuries Act and also to sue the Facility Association to recover for mental shock. This proposition has some appeal in terms of efficiency and economy of expense; and whether the legislation intended to make it necessary to sue two defendants. It is blunted however by the fact that if Alicia had been physically injured then the Facility Association would be the proper Defendant. Both counsel agree in that. If accept that her action for emotional injury is properly taken against Wawanesa then if she had at the same time suffered physical injury, there would again be duplication; one action against Wawanesa for emotional trauma and the other against the Facility Association for physical injuries. [7] The Insurance Act regulates the insurance coverage which is to be provided by insurers licensed to sell automobile insurance in Nova Scotia. Because it is fact of life that loss and injury occurs as the result of the operation of uninsured motor vehicles or drivers, the act establishes scheme for the protection of persons who suffer loss caused by uninsured vehicles. Section 106 of the Act requires that “every insurer carrying on the business of automobile insurance in the province shall be participant” in “The Facility Association Plan”. As Section 106 (1A) says the association will provide “payment with respect to claims for damages made by persons who are not insured under contract within the meaning of Section 139 and who have no other insurance”. [8] Automobile insurance is defined in Section 104 (c) 104 In this Part, (c) “automobile insurance” means insurance (i) against liability arising out of (A) bodily injury to or death of person, (B) loss of or damage to property caused by an automobile or the use or operation thereof. The section defines insured: 104 (f) “insured” means person insured by contract whether named or not, and includes any person who is stated in the contract to be entitled to benefits payable under insurance referred to in Section 140, whether or not the person is described therein as an insured person; (h) “motor vehicle liability policy” means policy, or that part of policy, evidencing contract insuring (ii) person who is not the owner or driver thereof where the automobile is being used or operated by his employee or agent or any other person on his behalf, against liability arising out of bodily injury to or the death or person or loss or damage to property caused by an automobile or the use or operation thereof; (emphasis added) 139 (1) (b) “person insured under contract” means (iii) in respect to claim for bodily injury or death, (B) the insured named in the contract and, if residing in the same dwelling premises as the insured named in th econtract, the insured’s spouse or common-law partner and any dependent relative 139 (2) Every contract evidenced by motor vehicle liability policy shall provide for payment by the insurer of all sums that (a) person insured under the contract is legally entitled to recover from the owner or driver of an uninsured automobile or unidentified automobile as damages for bodily injuries resulting from an accident involving an automobile; (b) person is legally entitled to recover from the owner or driver of an uninsured automobile or unidentified automobile as damages for bodily injury to or the death of person insured under the contract resulting from an accident involving an automobile; and (c) person insured under the contract is legally entitled to recover from the identified owner or driver of an uninsured automobile as damages for accidental damage to the insured automobile or its contents, or to both the insured automobile and its contents, resulting from an accident involving an automobile,subject to the terms, conditions, provisions, exclusions and limits prescribed by regulation. [9] It is of particular note that Section 139 (2) in subsections (a) and (c) refers to “a person insured” while Sub Section (b) encompasses persons outside that restricted class and refers simply to “a person”. However, the entitlement of that person is restricted to recovering damages suffered as result of the “bodily injury or death of person insured”. It is common ground that had Alicia Hartling suffered physical injury as result of the negligence of the Defendant LeBlanc, then it would be the Facility Association who would have to pay. [10] The parties are agreed that it is under this section 139 (2) (b) that family members may claim for damages as result of their entitlement as provided in the Fatal Injuries Act, R. S., 1989, 163. The Fatal Injuries Act entitles certain close family members; father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, step-father, step-mother, spouse, child, etc. to recover “damages as defined in Section (2) of the act including generally out of pocket expenses, but also “an amount to compensate for the loss of guidance, care and companionship expected (to be received) from the deceased if the death had not occurred”. [11] Section 139 (2)(b) would also apply, think, where the injury of “person insured” results in obligations to pay for nursing or rehabilitation and the expense or loss of income to “a person” who is responsible for the well being of the injured party. [12] It is instructive and in keeping with the case law that claim for damages surviving under the Fatal Injuries Act does not include claim for emotional distress or psychological injury which might result from the loss of loved one. Thus, it is in this context that Wawanesa takes the position that; while “a person insured” under Section 139 (2) (a) can recover for their own bodily injury including any psychological complications which they suffer as result of their own involvement in an accident; such is not the case under 139 (2)(b) where the claim of the “person” for emotional distress must be piggybacked on the bodily injury or death of the “person insured”. [13] Perhaps to sharpen the focus and as noted earlier, the Facility Association concedes that if Alicia Hartling had been physically injured as result of LeBlanc’s negligence, the Association would be liable to pay. But, since she was emotionally damaged- as result of the “bodily injury or death” of the “person insured”, then she is entitled to recover from Wawanesa. CONCLUSION: [14] Upon consideration I conclude that such is not the result. I do so because the emotional harm suffered by Alicia Hartling is simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties. [15] find it helpful to consider other possible scenarios where similar claim might be made. Consider for instance; circumstance where an infant, belonging to an “insured” household, playing in driveway is injured or killed by an uninsured vehicle, and neighbour, who is not person insured, watching the event suffers emotional trauma; or the same circumstance where the mother watches that event; think it could not be successfully argued that the neighbour is entitled to recover for emotional shock arising from the negligent act of this uninsured driver (perhaps salesman) except perhaps from the Facility Association. The mother, an insured person, as member of the injured household would be able to recover from their insurer, claiming Section Benefits. [16] The magnitude of the potential risk which the Facility Association would cast on the insurer would be dramatically apparent were an uninsured vehicle to crash into bus shelter housing 10 or 20 persons awaiting bus. If only one of those persons was injured or killed and happened to be “a person insured”, then the logical extension of the Facility argument would be that all the others, if they could prove emotional or psychological damage, would have valid Section claim. The impossibility of contemplating the extent of the potential liability constitutes valid reason for not distinguishing emotional damage resulting from such an accident to that of physical harm. [17] Less exotic, but nonetheless far reaching claims appear to have been discussed in this file. In particular, the father of Jonathan Hartling, who was not member of his household, and not an insured person under the policy, claimed to have been so distraught upon hearing the news of his son’s death, that he struck some object with his fist, causing physical injury and arguably suffering emotional pain. The Statement of Claim says of the father “he entered into state of extreme emotional distress or nervous shock whereupon he struck an object causing personal injury to his right arm, hand and shoulder and mental shock or trauma”. As noted earlier the courts have not recognized claim for such emotional distress arising from the death of loved one. It would be bizarre if one arose from the physical injury of loved one. Once again, would point out that loss to be recoverable must pass the test of foreseeability. The prospect of person, even family member suffering “mental shock” from hearing of the death of relative is surely too remote to be compensable under this contract. I conclude that the emotional injury of an uninjured person is not covered under the “Section D” provisions by reason of the fact that it is too remote from the original contract contemplated. It was not contemplated by the contracting parties to the insurance policy. It was not contemplated by the legislature when they passed the legislation. [18] Counsel have agreed that costs in the amount of $1,000.00 should be awarded to the successful party when decision is reached. Accordingly, Wawanesa will have an order for costs in that amount. Haliburton J.",7_2006nssc131.txt,"The deceased's cousin commenced an action for nervous shock after she observed the accident in which the deceased bicyclist was killed.
Since the defendant was an uninsured motorist, the Facility Association defended the plaintiff's action against him; however, the plaintiff also brought an action against the insurer of a motor vehicle policy under which the deceased was insured.
At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff.
The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties."

[2] This self-represented tenant included, as grounds of her appeal, “procedural violations” and “misinformation as to the purpose of the hearing”.
[3] The court’s detailed review of the application and proceedings before the Hearing Officer, including the written statements and communications sent to the rentalsman by the tenant, reveal the tenant’s concern over the short notice that she received of the hearing held March 11, 2008.
This prompted the tenant to request, in writing, an adjournment so that she could make arrangements to personally attend the hearing.
A second issue revealed by the materials and presumably referenced by the other ground of appeal is the preoccupation, at the hearing, with evidence concerning the activities of the tenant’s boyfriend and the impact his actions had upon the premises and disturbances caused by him had upon another tenant and his daughter who also resided in the building.
It was the tenant’s position that she was caught by surprise by this aspect of the hearing since no reference was made to this specific complaint in the landlord’s application.
In a letter the tenant sent to the rentalsman’s office Monday, March 10th she stated in part:...","This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board ordering the appellant to reinstate the respondents and pay them compensation for dismissing them due to their support of a union.
The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision.
Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing,
that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record.
In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial.
As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons.","[3, 5, 0, 1, 7, 4, 10, 6]",700,"J. C.A. No. 131106 NOVA SCOTIA COURT OF APPEAL Chipman, Matthews and Flinn, JJ.A. BETWEEN: FUTURE INNS CANADA INC. and LABOUR RELATIONS BOARD (NOVA SCOTIA); THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NOVA SCOTIA representing HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN in the right of the Province of Nova Scotia; DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS; HOTEL EMPLOYEES RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION, LOCAL 662; JEAN DEARMAN; GLORIA RAFUSE; CINDY MILLIGAN; LINDA RAFUSE; and PATRICIA HUBLEY Respondents Ian Blue, Q.C. and Blair H. Mitchell for the Appellant Louise Walsh Poirier for the Respondent, Labour Relations Board Gordon Forsyth for the Respondents Union and Jean Dearman, Gloria Rafuse, Cindy Milligan, Linda Rafuse and Patricia Hubley Appeal Heard: February 5, 1997 Judgment Delivered: February 26, 1997 THE COURT: The appeal is allowed with costs; the order of the Chambers judge is set aside and the matter is remitted to the Board for a rehearing as per reasons for judgment of Chipman, J.A.; Matthews and Flinn, JJ.A., concurring. CHIPMAN, J.A.: This is an appeal by Future Inns Canada Inc. from a judgment in the Supreme Court dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia) ordering Future Inns to reinstate the individual respondents, to pay them compensation, and refusing to reconsider the first two orders. Other respondents are Hotel Employees Restaurant Employees International Union, Local 662, (the Union); the Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia), (the Board); The Attorney General of Nova Scotia and the Director of Public Prosecutions. The last two named respondents did not appear at the appeal. Future Inns operates 120 room hotel in Dartmouth, which has been in business since September, 1989. It offers no frills accommodation. The hotel manager is Dorothy Lemire. Reporting to her are the head housekeeper, the assistant housekeeper, desk clerks and the maintenance man. There are about 20 housekeepers. Ms. Lemire is responsible for the discipline of the employees working under her. Housekeepers start work at 8:00 a.m. and leave after cleaning the guest rooms for which they are responsible. This is usually between 2:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. On Saturdays their work commences at 9:00 a.m. and they leave when they finish. Each day nine housekeepers are scheduled, and each is expected to clean about 12 to 15 rooms. Ms. Lemire normally works from 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., but is often called upon to return to the hotel to attend to various situations such as improperly cleaned rooms. Ms. Lemire testified before the Board about the need for quality housekeeping in the hotel. She often checked rooms personally. If rooms were not properly cleaned, the housekeeper would be sent back, and in the case of repeated deficiencies, reprimands and ultimately dismissals followed. On December 2, 1994, Ms. Lemire and the head housekeeper met with the housekeepers to emphasize the importance of proper cleaning of the rooms. On the following Monday, Ms. Lemire found that room cleaned by the respondent, Gloria Rafuse, was not properly done. She suspended Ms. Rafuse for one week. She also posted notice warning that if rooms were not cleaned to the satisfaction of the manager and head housekeeper, one week suspension could follow. In February, 1995, Ms. Lemire was concerned about the quality of the housekeeping and its effect upon the hotel's business and reputation. On Friday, February 10, 1995, Ms. Lemire had left work at 3:00 p.m. but returned to the hotel about 4:30 p.m. While she was at the front desk, guest called to complain about no towels. Ms. Lemire took the towels to the guest and decided to check some other rooms. In her room check she found pair of underpants under the bed in room that Jean Dearman had cleaned. She also found bloody kleenex, dirty kleenex, candy wrappers and pieces of wool in rooms cleaned by Gloria Rafuse. She thereupon determined to fire Dearman and Gloria Rafuse. She advised her employers of this intention. She made arrangements with the hotel's accountant to make up the final pay for Dearman and Gloria Rafuse. She picked up the documents at the accountant's office and drove to Dearman's home in Dartmouth. She arrived at 6:00 p.m. She advised Dearman that she was being dismissed ""due to neglect of duties"". She went to Gloria Rafuse's home in Windsor Junction, but she was not at home. On the following day, Saturday, February 11th, Ms. Lemire went to the hotel to deliver notice to Gloria Rafuse. They met in the housekeepers' room. Ms. Lemire told her she was dismissed. When asked why, she said it was because of ""lack of duties"". She advised Gloria Rafuse that she had personally checked her room. Gloria Rafuse then cleaned out her locker. She discussed the matter with the respondents Linda Rafuse, Patricia Hubley and Cindy Milligan. The four of them then walked upstairs, put their keys in the front desk, and walked out together. Ms. Lemire asked Linda Rafuse if she was working that day and was told that none of them was. Ms. Lemire said that she was then left with 54 rooms to clean on Saturday and no housekeepers to clean them. Ms. Lemire decided that Milligan, Hubley and Linda Rafuse had quit, and did not want them to return. On the following Monday, Linda Rafuse, Hubley and Milligan arrived at the hotel and asked Lemire for their jobs back. Lemire refused, saying that anybody leaving her with 54 rooms did not deserve to have job. In the meantime other events occurred in late January and early February, 1995. The respondent Dearman had become concerned about Gloria Rafuse's one week suspension in December and the suspension of another housekeeper for missing glass and an unlocked window in room. Ms. Dearman's husband belonged to union. He contacted Paul Burgwin, representative of the respondent Union. Paul Burgwin asked Ms. Dearman to get the housekeepers together for meeting. In January, 1995, Dearman discussed forming union with them. These discussions took place in an outside smoking area and at nearby Tim Hortons and took place over period of two weeks. meeting was scheduled for Ms. Dearman's home on the evening of Wednesday, February 8, 1995, to which all the individual respondents were invited. further meeting was arranged for Sunday, February 12th, to sign up union membership cards and collect dues. On February 13, 1995, the Union, on behalf of the respondents Dearman, Gloria Rafuse and Cindy Milligan made complaint of unfair labour practice to the Board on Form 16 under the Act against Future Inns. It alleged: Nature of Complaint: The individual complainant are all members of the Complainant Union. The Union has been organizing employees of the Respondent in connection with an application for certification pursuant to the Trade Union Act of Nova Scotia which was made on February 13, 1995. The individual complainants were dismissed from their employment on February 10 and 11, 1995, because of their support for the Union. The Respondent is refusing to employ the complainants because they are members of trade union and have participated in the activities of trade union. The Respondent is attempting to intimidate its employees to compel them to refrain from being member of trade union or participating in the activities of trade union. On February 15, 1995, the Union, on behalf of the respondents Linda Rafuse and Patricia Hubley, filed complaint against Future Inns on Form 16 in the same terms. The complaints were heard by panel of the Board on April 26, June 27 and 28, 1995. The Union was represented by counsel. Future Inns was represented by Charles Henman, lay person. The Board heard the testimony of Ms. Dearman, Linda Rafuse, Gloria Rafuse, Paul Burgwin and Ms. Lemire. Following the hearing, the Board issued Order LRB 4367 on July 19th which dismissed the respondent Union's application for certification. The order then disposed of the complaints of unfair labour practices as follows: AND the Board having been satisfied that the acts of Unfair Labour Practice were committed pursuant to Section 53 of the Trade Union Act; ... AND the Board does further order the Respondent to reinstate Jean Dearman, Gloria Rafuse, Cindy Milligan, Linda Rafuse and Patricia Hubley to their former positions and to pay to these individuals all compensation earned as if they had not been terminated by the Respondent. AND the Board retains jurisdiction in this matter should the parties be unable to reach agreement on the issue of compensation entitled to be received by these five employees. On October 16, 1995, the Board issued an order reciting Order LRB 4267, that the Board had been reconvened for hearing on the matter of compensation, was satisfied that none of the five former employees had been reinstated or compensated, and that Linda Rafuse, Gloria Rafuse and Patricia Hubley still sought reinstatement and compensation while Jean Dearman and Cindy Milligan no longer sought reinstatement, but compensation only. The order then required Future Inns to make compensation as follows: Linda Rafuse 9,465.92 Gloria Rafuse 7,222.45 Patricia Hubley 5,081.63 Jean Dearman 3,537.09 Cindy Milligan 4,326.63 TOTAL: $29,633.72 The Board further made calculations of the pay periods for Linda Rafuse, Gloria Rafuse and Patricia Hubley in the event reinstatement did not occur on October 16, 1995. By letter dated October 26, 1995, the interim Chief Executive Officer of the Board denied Future Inns leave to bring an application for reconsideration of Order LRB 4267. Future Inns has not reinstated any of the employees. As consequence of its failure to abide by the order of the Board, the Minister of Labour has given written consent to the prosecution of Future Inns under s. 86 of the Act for failure to comply with an order made under s. 57 thereof. Future Inns brought applications to the Supreme Court for orders in the nature of certiorari to quash the orders of the Board. The applications were heard on June 3, and 19, 1996, at which time evidence was adduced before the Chambers judge on behalf of Future Inns and the respondents. By decision dated August 9, 1996, the Chambers judge dismissed the applications of Future Inns and concluded: (a) The decisions of the Board were protected by the privative clause in paragraph 19(1) of the Act. They could only be reviewed on the standard of patent unreasonableness of the Board's decisions. (b) It was not possible to determine from the order of the Board what subsection of s. 53 of the Trade Union Act the Board found was violated, giving rise to an unfair labour practice. On review of the transcript and the evidence, the Chambers judge concluded that there was some evidence on which the Board could find an unfair labour practice. The privative clause in the Act precluded the court from weighing the evidence and coming to its own conclusion on this issue. As there was evidence upon which the Board could find that Future Inns committed an unfair labour practice, the decision of the Board was not patently unreasonable. (c) The Board had not breached the rules of natural justice in failing to advise Future Inns of its right to counsel even though there was no doubt that the Chair of the Board knew that Mr. Henman was ""out of his depth"". (d) Evidence relating to comment made by counsel for the respondent Union and to smiles or laughter on the part of some members of the Board did not raise reasonable apprehension of bias. (e) While it may have been preferable if the Board had given reasons for its decision, it was not obligated to do so, and thus did not act in procedurally unfair manner. Future Inns appeals to this Court, raising three principal issues procedural fairness, reasonable apprehension of bias and failure to give reasons. As have concluded that the Board's order must be quashed because it failed to give reasons, it is not necessary to deal with the other two issues. In recent years, with the development of multitude of tribunals with varying degrees of protection from judicial review, it has become fashionable for such tribunals to give reasons for their decisions. In many jurisdictions, the giving of reasons is now required by statute. In Nova Scotia, the Law Reform Commission has recommended that such legislation be enacted. See Final Report, Reform of the Administrative Justice System in Nova Scotia, January, 1997, pp. 55-57. The Chambers judge acknowledged that reasons would have been desirable. Nevertheless, we start this inquiry with the recognition that the Board is not bound by legislation to provide reasons for its decision and that in the absence of such requirement reasons are not generally mandated. We must canvass the authorities to see the extent to which we have the power at common law to quash the orders because no reasons were given. In Re R.D.R. Construction Limited v. Rent Review Commission (1983), 1982 CanLII 3265 (NS CA), 55 N.S.R. (2d) 71, this Court heard an appeal from the Rent Review Commission established under the Rent Review Act, 1975 S.N.S., c. 56. The appeal was, by s. 27 of the Act, confined to question law or jurisdiction. The appellant landlord requested rent increase from the Residential Tenancy Officer who dealt with the application at hearing and issued decision fixing approved rents. The Officer's decision was appealed to the Commission which held hearing. The Commission refused to provide certain information respecting the process followed by the officer in fixing the rents. In deciding that there was failure of natural justice on the part of the Commission going to jurisdiction in that it did not make the information available to the appellant, Cooper, J.A., on behalf of this Court, said at p. 81: In my opinion fair play in this case requires that the record of the proceedings before the Officer should have been made available to the appellant. This is particularly important where, as here, the Officer's decision does not contain reasons but only recital of what was done and the result. In particular her reasons for rejecting the financial information and the conclusions drawn from it by the appellant were not given. How then could the appellant adequately present its case before the Commission or decide what additional evidence it should adduce? At p. 83 Cooper, J.A. said: It has been commonly accepted that in the absence of statutory requirement person in the position of the Officer is not bound to give reasons for his or her decision. in Re Glendenning Motorways Inc. and Royal Transportation Ltd. et al. (1975), 1975 CanLII 1116 (MB CA), 59 D.L.R. (3d) 89 (Man. C.A.), Hall, J.A., said at p. 92, referring to decision of the Highway Traffic and Motor Transport Board of Manitoba: On the question of whether the Board is required to give written reasons for its decision approving the application, again, there is no statutory requirement for this to be done. Whether it should be is, of course, matter for the Legislature. Unless the court is prepared on some basis to compel the Board to give written reasons, cannot see any useful purpose in repeatedly expressing desire that the Board furnish written reasons for its decision. But in Norton Tool Co. Ltd. v. Tewson, [1973] W.L.R. 45 (National Industrial Relations Court), Sir John Donaldson for the court had this to say at p. 49: Our jurisdiction is limited to consideration of questions of law. Accordingly, it is not sufficient for an appellant to satisfy this court that, within the range of discretion conferred upon the tribunal, it might or even would have reached different conclusion. If an appellant is to succeed, he must satisfy this court that the tribunal has erred in principle. But it is corollary of the discretion conferred upon the tribunals that it is their duty to set out their reasoning in sufficient detail to show the principles upon which they have proceeded. similar obligation lies upon this court, when sitting as court of first instance from which appeal lies to the Court of Appeal on questions of law alone. Were it otherwise, the parties would in effect be deprived of their right of appeal on questions of law. No great elaboration is required and the task should not constitute burden... In deSmith's, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (4th Ed.) at p. 148, after the author had stated ""There is no general rule of English law that reasons must be given for administrative (or indeed judicial) decisions"" he said at p. 149: In certain other situations there may be an implied duty to state the reasons or grounds for decision (Michael Akehurst, 'Statements of Reasons for Judicial and Administrative Decisions' (1970) 33 M.L.R. 1954). person prejudicially affected by decision must be adequately notified of the case he has to meet in order to exercise any right he may have to make further representations (see Chap. 4, post) or effectively to exercise right of appeal (Norton Tool Co. Ltd. v. Tewson, [1973] W.L.R. 45, 49, and cases cited in note 11, ante)... It seems to me that in this case there was such an implied duty for the reasons stated in the passage from deSmith, which have just quoted. (emphasis added) In Re Yarmouth Housing Ltd. v. Rent Review Commission (1982), 1982 CanLII 2887 (NS CA), 54 N.S.R. (2d) 28, this Court heard an appeal from the Rent Review Commission which confirmed the decision of tenancy officer denying requested rent increase. An appeal to this Court pursuant to the Rent Review Act was allowed on the ground that the Commission erred in law the fixing the approved rent. After holding that the matter should be remitted to the Commission, Cooper, J.A., on behalf of the Court, said at p. 41: add also that in my opinion the Commission is required to give reasons for its decisions. This question was considered by this court in R.D.R. Construction Limited v. Rent Review Commission, ., with respect to decisions of residential tenancy officers. It was there stated that there was an implied duty on the part of such officers to give reasons for their decisions and reference was made to Norton Tool Co. Ltd. v. Tewson, [1973] W.L.R. 45, and deSmith's, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (4th Ed.) at p. 148. In my view the same reasoning applied to decisions of the Commission. It should not confine itself merely to recital of the information before it and its conclusions, but it has duty to set out why it has rejected the information and evidence produced before it by the applicant. The applicant is entitled to know on what grounds his appeal has been rejected and where, in the opinion of the Commission, he has gone wrong. (emphasis added) recent case dealing with failure to give reasons is Re Williams v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (1996), 1996 CanLII 4093 (FC), 139 D.L.R. (4th) 658 (F.C.T.D.). There, Reed, J. of the Federal Court, Trial Division, quashed decision of delegate of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration determining that the applicant should be deported. The applicant was permanent resident of Canada who had lived in the country for some 21 years. He had been convicted of serious drug related offences and the Minister's delegate determined, under s. 70(5) of the Immigration Act, that he was danger to the public and should be deported. The delegate gave no reasons for his decision. On an application for judicial review, it was urged that the decision was inconsistent with s. of the Charter and s. 2(e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights. The headnote in the report summarizes the court's reasoning: The concept of danger to the public is not so vague that it provides insufficient guidance for informed legal debate. Nevertheless, the principles of fundamental justice, natural justice and fairness require that the permanent resident be given the reasons for the determination that he was danger to the public. Reasons are required because the consequences of the decision are substantial, and the decision-making process gives no assurance that the ultimate decision-maker has considered the permanent resident's submissions. In addition, without reasons, it is not clear what criteria in determining danger to the public are being applied, and whether they are consistent and lawful. At p. 670, Reed, J. referred to the text by deSmith, Woolf and Jowell, Judicial Review of Administrative Action, 5th ed. (London: Sweet Maxwell, 1995) containing discussion of the extent to which the principles of natural justice require decision maker to give reasons. There is such requirement where statute expressly or impliedly so requires, and in limited situations where reasons are important to assess whether an action for judicial review can be maintained Reed, J. said at p. 670: This last is said to exist when the issue for the individual is of such importance that he cannot be left to receive an unreasoned decision, as if ""the distant oracle has spoken and that is that"" (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex p. Doody, [1994] A.C. 531 (H.L.) at 565). Reed, J. referred to R. v. Civil Service Appeal Board, ex p. Cunningham, [1991] All E.R. 310 (C.A.) where Lord Donaldson M.R. stated at p. 319: ...the Board should have given outline reasons sufficient to show to what they were directing their mind and thereby indirectly showing not whether their decision was right or wrong, which is matter solely for them, but whether their decision was lawful. Any other conclusion would reduce the board to the status of free-wheeling palm tree. Reed, J. then referred to R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex p. Doody, supra, where Lord Mustill said at p. 564: It is not, as understand it, questioned that the decision of the Home Secretary on the penal element is susceptible to judicial review. To mount an effective attack on the decision, given no more material than the facts of the offence and the length of the penal element, the prisoner has virtually no means of ascertaining whether this is an instance where the decision-making process has gone astray. think it is important that there should be an effective means of detecting the kind of error which would entitle the court to intervene, and in practice regard it as necessary for this purpose that the reasoning of the Home Secretary should be disclosed. At p. 672, Reed, J. reaches the following conclusions on the basis of material considered by her: The absence of jurisprudence with respect to the requirement of written reasons in Canada may exist because, in most cases, where section interests (or even lesser interests) are involved, there are statutory requirements that written reasons be given. The giving of reasons serves several purposes. First and perhaps most importantly, it gives some assurance to the individual concerned that his or her submissions have been considered (the absence of reasons can create disturbing impression of injustice). Secondly, it provides meaningful basis on which an assessment can be made as to whether or not to appeal the decision or to seek judicial review when that is the appropriate remedy. Thirdly, from the perspective of reviewing Court, indeed, in the case of judicial review, it is very difficult, often impossible, to know on what basis decision was made if reasons are not given. Reasons are not as important when full right of appeal exists. In such circumstances the reviewing Court can consider all the evidence and determine whether in its view errors exist with respect to the conclusions drawn. In the case of judicial review, however, reviewing Court starts with presumption that deference must be accorded to the decision-maker. person is entitled to some assurance that all factors have been considered, and to fair opportunity to exercise his or her right of judicial review with respect to decisions made inadequately. Reasons allow both the person concerned and Court, on judicial review, to know whether the appropriate legal test has been applied by the decision­maker. (emphasis added) Reed, J. has referred to three specific purposes served by the giving of such reasons. would add another which would be obvious to any judge. When one sits down to prepare the reasons to support conclusion tentatively reached, the articulation of the reasons tests the validity of the conclusion. At times, the writer is compelled to change the result. The preparation of supporting reasons is the best self-assessment decision maker can make of his or her decision. The greater the protection from judicial review accorded to Tribunal, the greater may be the need for reasons. In Williams, supra, Reed, J. said at p. 673: The circumstances of this case are such that the principles of fundamental justice, natural justice and fairness are not met unless the applicant is given reasons for the decision that has been made. This follows from number of considerations. In the first place the consequences for the individual are substantial. Secondly, the decision making-process (through three levels of immigration officials) gives no assurance that the ultimate decision-maker, in fact, considers the applicant's submissions directly. Thirdly, reading the Guidelines that have been issued, and the evidence of the applicant's offences that formed the basis for the decision, it is not clear what reasoning led to this applicant being found to be present or future danger to the public. Fourthly, in the absence of even brief reasons, reviewing Court on judicial review cannot determine whether the decision-makers (the delegates of the Minister) are applying consistent and lawful criteria in making decisions that an individual is danger to the public in Canada. The respondents refer to R. v. Burns (1994), 1994 CanLII 127 (SCC), 165 N. R. 374 (S.C.C.). There, the British Columbia Court of Appeal set aside convictions for indecent assault and sexual assault and ordered new trial because the reasons of the trial judge did not enable the court to determine whether the judge had properly directed himself to all the evidence and the legal questions bearing on the issues. The trial judge's reasons were indeed brief, consisting of statement that he had accepted the complainant's evidence as to the alleged incidents and that based thereon he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. In reversing the British Columbia Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada, in addressing the duty of trial judge to give reasons said at p. 382: Failure to indicate expressly that all relevant considerations have been taken into account in arriving at verdict is not basis for allowing an appeal under s. 686(1)(a). This accords with the general rule that trial judge does not err merely because he or she does not give reasons for deciding one way or the other on problematic points: see R. v. Smith (D.A.), 1990 CanLII 99 (SCC), [1990] S.C.R. 991; 111 N.R. 144; 109 A.R. 160, affing. 1989 ABCA 187 (CanLII), 95 A.R. 304 (C.A.), and R. v. MacDonald, 1976 CanLII 140 (SCC), [1977] S.C.R. 665; N.R. 271. The judge is not required to demonstrate that he or she knows the law and has considered all aspects of the evidence. Nor is the judge required to explain why he or she does not entertain reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt. Failure to do any of these things does not, in itself, permit court of appeal to set aside the verdict. This rule makes good sense. To require trial judges charged with heavy caseloads of criminal cases to deal in their reasons with every aspect of every case would slow the system of justice immeasurably. Trial judges are presumed to know the law with which they work day in and day out. If they state their conclusions in brief compass, and these conclusions are supported by the evidence, the verdict should not be overturned merely because they fail to discuss collateral aspects of the case. Burns, supra, is not authority for the proposition that courts, let alone other tribunals, can render significant decisions without reasons in all cases. take this decision to mean that minimum requirement is that judge provide statement of conclusions in brief compass so that the court can then see if these are supported by the evidence. My view of Burns, supra, is confirmed upon reading of the short judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada delivered by lacobucci, J. in R. v. Barrett, 1995 CanLII 129 (SCC), [1995] S.C.R. 752: We all agree that this appeal is governed by the principles recently discussed by our Court in R. v. Burns, 1994 CanLII 127 (SCC), [1994] S.C.R. 656, and related cases. The decision in Burns was not available to the Ontario Court of Appeal when it rendered its judgment. While it is clearly preferable to give reasons and although there may be some cases where reasons may be necessary, by itself, the absence of reasons of trial judge cannot be ground for appellate review when the finding is otherwise supportable on the evidence or where the basis of the finding is apparent from the circumstances. The issue is the reasonableness of the finding not an absence or insufficiency of reasons. In this case, the basis for the ruling of the trial judge on the voir dire is clear. The only issue was credibility. The trial judge's ruling demonstrated that he did not accept the evidence of the accused. In these circumstances, the failure of the trial judge to state the basis of his decision on the voir dire did not occasion an error of law or miscarriage of justice. We also find no error in law in the charge to the jury. (emphasis added) It is to be observed that lacobucci, J. was careful to note that there may be some cases where reasons may be necessary. In Barret supra, it is clear that the court was satisfied that the ruling demonstrated that the trial judge did not accept the evidence of the accused. The only issue was credibility. The scope of appellate review in criminal case is wider than the standard of review of decision of tribunal protected by privative clause such as that contained in s. 19(1) of the Act. court can examine the evidence and reweigh it to some extent to determine whether the verdict was reasonable. Section 19(1) of the Act provides that decision or order of the Board in any proceeding ""is final and conclusive and not open to question or review"". It was common ground among the parties to this appeal that before decision so protected can be questioned, the appellant must demonstrate that it was patently unreasonable decision. In C.A.I.M.A.W. v. Paccar of Canada Ltd., 1989 CanLII 49 (SCC), [1989] S.C.R. 983 Laforest, J. said at pp. 1003-4: Where, as here, an administrative tribunal is protected by privative clause, this Court has indicated that it will only review the decision of the Board if that Board has either made an error in interpreting the provisions conferring jurisdiction on it, or has exceeded its jurisdiction by making patently unreasonable error of law in the performance of its function: see CUPE, Local 963 v. N.B. Liquor Corp., 1979 CanLII 23 (SCC), [1979] S.C.R. 227. The tribunal has the right to make errors, even serious ones, provided it does not act in manner ""so patently unreasonable that its construction cannot be rationally supported by the relevant legislation and demands intervention by the court upon review"". The test for review is ""severe test""; see Blanchard v. Control Data Canada Ltd., 1984 CanLII 27 (SCC), [1984] S.C.R. 476, at p. 493. This restricted scope of review requires the courts to adopt posture of deference to the decisions of the tribunal. Curial deference is more than just fiction courts resort to when they are in agreement with the decisions of the tribunal. Mere disagreement with the result arrived at by the tribunal does not make that result ""patently unreasonable"". The courts must be careful to focus their inquiry on the existence of rational basis for the decision of the tribunal, and not on their agreement with it. The emphasis should be not so much on what result the tribunal has arrived at, but on how the tribunal arrived at that result. Privative clauses, such as those contained in ss. 31 to 34 of the Code, are permissible exercises of the legislative authority and, to the extent that they restrict the scope of curial review within their constitutional jurisdiction, the Court should respect that limitation and defer to the Board. (emphasis added) In National Corn Growers Association et al. v. Canadian Import Tribunal (1990), 1990 CanLII 49 (SCC), 114 N.R. 81(S.C.C.), the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed decision of the Federal Court dismissing an application for judicial review claiming that the Tribunal decision was patently unreasonable. In his closing remarks, Gonthier, J. said at p. 122: would add one final observation. In the course of these reasons, have at times dealt in some detail with the manner in which the Tribunal arrived at its conclusion. Unlike my colleague, Wilson, J., do not think that the Tribunal's references to the provisions of the GATT, as well as all other aspects of the reasoning by which it arrived at its interpretation of SIMA, are totally irrelevant to determination of an application for judicial review. With respect, do not understand how conclusion can be reached, as to the reasonableness of tribunal's interpretation of its enabling statute without considering the reasoning underlying it, and would be surprised if that were the effect of this court's decision in C.U.P.E., supra (emphasis added) Clearly, reasons are not always required. In Khaliq-Kareemi v. Health Services and Insurance Commission (N.S.) (1989), 89 N.S.R. (2d) 388, this Court allowed an appeal from decision in Supreme Court reversing an order of the Commission finding that psychiatrist had fraudulently submitted claims and habitually claimed for services not medically required. No reasons were given by the Commission. This Court held that they were not necessary because the charges were abundantly clear. The only issue was whether the evidence established the allegations. Jones, J.A. said at p. 401: The charges before the Commissioner were abundantly clear. The only issue was whether the evidence established those allegations. The Commission obviously accepted the evidence supporting the allegations and rejected the evidence of the respondent. Apart from the issue of credibility reasons would have added little or nothing. In my view reasons were not required in the circumstances. I am satisfied that courts can and should require written reasons from a Tribunal wherever there are substantial issues to be resolved. How can the court determine the existence of rational basis for the decision of the Tribunal if it does not know how the Tribunal arrived at the result? If the determination of the reasonableness of a tribunal\'s decision can only be made by considering ""the reasoning underlying it"" and these reasons are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record, written reasons are necessary. Failure of tribunal to do so in such cases makes its decision patently unreasonable decision which will be set aside. The disappointed litigant and the reviewing court must know the process followed by Tribunal in order to see, in the case of the litigant, if review should be sought, and in the case of the court whether interference with the decision is warranted. Counsel for the Board emphasizes that no case has been found where court has held that failure to give reasons makes tribunal's decision patently unreasonable. No case on point is needed. The principle is clear. Patent unreasonableness can assume many forms. am prepared to reach the result here on the application of fundamental principles. As well, the cases have reviewed support the conclusion that in such cases there is an implied duty to give reasons. Breach of this duty is breach of the rules of natural justice. will review the issues before the Board and consider the evidence heard by it in order to judge whether it can be said that its decision without reasons is, in the circumstances, patently unreasonable, and whether there was an implied duty to give reasons. The complaints break down into the following allegations: (a) the complainants were dismissed on February 10 and 11 because of their support for the Union; (b) Future Inns is refusing to employ the complainants because they are members of trade union; (c) Future Inns is refusing to employ the complainants because they have participated in the activities of trade union; (d) Future Inns is attempting to intimidate its employees to compel them to refrain from being member of trade union or participate in the activities of trade union. The Board simply stated that it was satisfied that the acts of unfair labour practice by Future Inns were committed pursuant to s. 53 of the Act. That section details number of unfair labour practices: 53 (1) No employer and no person acting on behalf of an employer shall (a) participate in or interfere with the formation or administration of trade union or the representation of employees by trade union. Prohibited activities of an employer are listed in s. 53(3) of the Act. 53 (3) No employer and no person acting on behalf of an employer shall (a) refuse to employ or to continue to employ any person or otherwise discriminate against any person in regard to employment or any term or condition of employment, because the person (i) is or was member of trade union, (ii) has been expelled or suspended from membership in trade union for reason other than failure to pay the periodic dues, assessments and initiation fees uniformly required to be paid by all members of the trade union as condition of acquiring or retaining membership in the trade union, (iii) has testified or otherwise participated or may testify or otherwise participate in proceeding under this Act, (iv) has made or is about to make disclosure that he may be required to make in proceeding under this Act, (v) has made an application or filed complaint under this Act, (vi) has participated in strike that is not prohibited by this Act or exercised any right under this Act; It will be observed that the complaints appear to allege violations of both ss. 53(1)(a) and 53(3)(a) with respect to five different complainants, as well as an attempt to intimidate its employees generally which appears to allege violation of s. 53(1)(a). In assessing the complaints, the Board was required to take into account s. 56(3) of the Act with respect to complaints falling within s. 53(3)(a): 56 (3) Where the complainant establishes that it is reasonable to believe that there may have been failure by an employer or any person acting on behalf of an employer to comply with clause (a) of subsection (3) of Section 53, the burden of proving there is no failure shall be upon the employer or the person acting on behalf of the employer. There was no evidence before the Board that prior to February 14, 1995, either the Union, the individual respondents or anyone else informed Ms. Lemire or any other representative of the appellant that the individual respondents were trying to organize union at the hotel. Ms. Lemire testified at the hearing that she was unaware of any discussions about forming union until February 14, 1995, when she was so advised by representative of the Board. By then, the termination of the five individual respondents had taken place. There was evidence that the dismissals of Ms. Dearman and Gloria Rafuse were carried out in manner different from the way in which such matters were normally handled. Three of the individual respondents, Gloria Rafuse, Linda Rafuse and Dearman testified that they suspected they had been fired because they were trying to form union. However, they were unable to point to any evidence that Ms. Lemire or anybody else acting on behalf of Future Inns knew that union was in the process of being formed. Ms. Lemire denied such knowledge. The employer's knowledge of the attempted formation of the Union is critical to establishing the case against the employer. The Chambers judge addressed this key issue: Mrs. Lemire was the sole management employee called by Future Inns at the hearing. There were discrepancies between the information filed by Mrs. Lemire with the unemployment insurance people with respect to these terminations and her evidence at the hearing as to why Gloria Rafuse and Jean Dearman were fired. She could not explain these discrepancies. Jean Dearman was fired at home. No prior employees had been fired at their homes. Jean Dearman and Gloria Rafuse were fired with haste. The rooms they cleaned on Friday were stated by Mrs. Lemire to be unacceptable. Jean Dearman was not to work again until the following Monday. Gloria Rafuse was to work the next day, Saturday. Mrs. Lemire went to their homes Friday night to fire them. She found Jean Dearman at home and fired her on Friday evening. She did not find Gloria Rafuse at home, and fired her the following day when she reported to work. There was evidence from the complainants that there was grapevine in the hotel, whereby Mrs. Lemire would be aware of most things going on at the hotel. There was also evidence that Fred George, who worked as maintenance man at the hotel, was related to Mrs. Lemire. There was lack of any substantial warnings to Mrs. Dearman that her work was not satisfactory, although this was not the case with respect to Gloria Rafuse, who had been suspended for one week for poor work two months earlier. Jean Dearman and Gloria Rafuse were fired on Friday night and Saturday morning respectively, in the time between the first organizing meeting on Wednesday night and the second proposed organizing meeting on Sunday night. All of this provides evidence from which the Board could infer knowledge of the unionizing effort and anti-union animus. Accordingly, find there was evidence before the Board on which it could find that Future Inns committed an unfair labour practice and therefore, the decision of the Board was not patently unreasonable. (emphasis added) The Chambers judge directs these comments to the dismissals of Ms. Dearman and Gloria Rafuse only. The conclusion respecting these firings is that evidence to support reasonable inference that Future Inns engaged in prohibited practices arise from: (a) Ms. Lemire attempted to fire two of the employees at home. (b) There was evidence about grapevine at the hotel. (c) maintenance man at the hotel was related to Ms. Lemire. (d) That there was lack of substantial warnings to Dearman that her work was not satisfactory. have examined the record before the Board and in the absence of any reasons from the Board giving insight into its thinking, it appears to me that what the Chambers judge characterizes as ""evidence from which the Board could infer knowledge of the Union effort and anti-union animus"" is anything but substantial. General statements such as Gloria Rafuse's comment, ""Well, mean everybody talks"" are not sufficient foundation upon which one can draw reasonable inferences. Neither Gloria Rafuse or any of the other witnesses on behalf of the claimants could point to any piece of information about the Union's activities having reached management's ears. Ms.Lemire's testimony that she had no knowledge of the Union's activities is clear as is her testimony that she fired the employees for unsatisfactory performance. She had fired other employees in the past for such things as the use of bad language to guests and poor housecleaning. Lemire testified that she had spoken to Dearman about poor work ""many, many times"". Ms. Dearman conceded that she had been spoken to on previous occasion about alleged unsatisfactory work. Gloria Rafuse had been suspended for week for poor housekeeping in December of 1994. Linda Rafuse had walked out some two years earlier and had been taken back in spite of reservations held by Ms. Lemire. In August of 1994 she had been put on probation for one month for lack of supervision of housekeepers. Did the Board find Ms. Lemire not credible? We do not know. compelling case for the giving of reasons arises from the number of issues before the Board which were aired over three days of hearings. The question of knowledge on the part of Future Inns of Union activities was substantial issue which should have been addressed. There were three distinct situations involved in the complaints. Only two of the five individual respondents were fired directly; the other three Linda Rafuse, Hubley and Milligan walked out upon the dismissal of Gloria Rafuse. They knew they had left their jobs because the following Monday they came to ask for them back. The allegation of dismissals refer to the dates February 10 and 11. It is not contended that anybody was dismissed on February 13. We have no analysis from the Board as to what it considered were the acts of Future Inns in discharging or failing to hire these employees or of intimidation generally. The Board was confronted with complaints dealing with three separate dismissals: (a) Ms. Dearman; (b) Gloria Rafuse; (c) Linda Rafuse, Cindy Milligan and Patricia Hubley. As to each of these, it was called upon to decide: (i) Whether the dismissal was because of support by the employee for the Union. This appears to allege violation of s. 53(1)(a) of the Act interference with the formation of trade union or the representation of employees by trade union. The reverse onus provision of s. 56(3) has no application. The dismissal could also be violation of s. 53(3)(a)(vi). The Board did refer to the fact that all five respondents were ""terminated"" by Future Inns. This is the only clue to its thinking, leading one to suspect that the ""acts"" of unfair labour practice were terminations. These were alleged to have occurred on February 10 and 11. (ii) Whether the refusal to employ was because the employees were members of the trade union. This appears to allege violation of s. 53(3)(a)(i). There was no allegation of refusal to continue to employ. The Board seemed to be thinking of terminations. The reverse onus provisions of s. 56 may be looked at if the threshold of establishing union membership has been reached. On the evidence, these employees had not become Union members prior to their dismissal. Indeed, it is not apparent from the evidence whether they ever became Union members. The Board has afforded no indication of what, if anything, it thought about these considerations. (iii) Whether the refusal to employ took place because the employee participated in the activities of trade union. This could be violation of s. 53(1)(a) of the Act. It could also, depending on what view the Board took of the evidence, be violation of s. 53(3)(a)(vi) of the Act, because the employee was exercising right under s. 13(1) of the Act. There is no allegation of refusal to continue to employ. The Board seems to have been thinking in terms of terminations. Unfortunately, there is no finding in this respect and it is uncertain at best whether the reverse onus provisions of s. 56(3) have application. There is general allegation that Future Inns attempted to intimidate its employees to compel them to refrain from being member of trade union or participate in the activities of trade union. This alleges violation of s. 53(1)(a). The reverse onus section is not applicable to that subsection. observe that during the argument before the Board counsel for the Union urged the reverse onus section upon the Board. Mr. Henman did not appear to have made any analysis of the effect of s. 56(3), although he referred briefly to it in his submissions. In short, s. 56(3) may or may not have applied to the fact finding process depending on what facts were found and which alleged acts of unfair labour practice were being considered. There is no indication that this was thought out by the Board. As to all of the complaints, we do not have the benefit of any analysis whether, if the reverse onus section applied, the Board addressed its mind to the prerequisite for its application, namely on what basis it was reasonable to believe that there may have been failure by Future Inns to comply with s. 53(3)(a). Counsel for the respondents urge that it is not the role of the reviewing court on certiorari application to second guess the Board on the weight and sufficiency of the evidence before it. They say that the absence of detailed reasons by the Board does not make its decision patently unreasonable or remove curial deference to its decisions. They emphasize that the patently unreasonable test sets very high threshold for judicial review, as indeed it does. They tell us that enough can be found in the record to support the conclusions of the Board. That is also the conclusion of the Chambers judge as appears from the passage have quoted from her decision. am satisfied that neither the arguments of counsel for the respondents nor the rationalizations of the Chambers judge form an adequate substitute for reasons from the Board showing what underlay its conclusions on the many issues here presented to it. The respondents are in effect asking this Court to guess at the reasoning underlying the conclusions of the Board simply because there is evidence upon which the Board could, if it chose, base its conclusions. The real problem here is that we simply do not know what it was that drove the Board to its conclusions. The issues relating to these five employees were complex and the concerns of the parties substantial. The order of the Board imposes significant monetary liability upon Future Inns. Failure to comply with the order also renders Future Inns subject to prosecution. In the circumstances, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving this decision without reasons. There was an implied duty on the Board here to furnish reasons. It was in breach of the rules of natural justice or fair play. It is simply not sufficient that the matter was resolved by the following terse conclusions: AND the Board having been satisfied that the acts of Unfair Labour Practice were committed pursuant to Section 53 of the Trade Union Act; ... AND the Board does further order the Respondent to reinstate Jean Dearman, Gloria Rafuse, Cindy Milligan, Linda Rafuse and Patricia Hubley to their former positions and to pay to these individuals all compensation earned as if they had not been terminated by the Respondent. Counsel for the Union suggested that this Court remit the matter to the Board with an order that it furnish reasons for its decision. The Board has already made its decision. It was decision reached in patently unreasonable manner and contrary to the rules of natural justice. To ask it to make up reasons after the fact would be futile exercise. I would allow the appeal and set aside the order of the Chambers judge. I would quash the decision of the Board and remit the matter to the Board for a rehearing. This must, to the greatest extent possible, be heard before differently composed panel. would also award costs to the appellant on the appeal against the respondents Union and Board, jointly and severally, in the amount of $2,500.00, plus disbursements. On the same basis, would award the appellant costs against those respondents before the Chambers judge in the amount fixed by her, $2,500.00, inclusive of disbursements. As between these two respondents, one-half of the costs should be paid by each. Chipman, J.A. Concurred in: Matthews, J. Flinn, J.A. 1996 S.H.

Edwards PLACE HEARD: Port Hood, Nova Scotia DATE HEARD: November 19, 1999 DECISION: Written December 22, 1999 COUNSEL: Réjean Aucoin, Esq., for the Appellant Laurie Halfpenny MacQuarrie for the Respondent Edwards, J.: The issue in this appeal is whether a Provincial Court Judge is obligated to advise an unrepresented accused of his right to trial in either or both of the official languages of Canada pursuant to Section 530(1) of the Criminal Code. If so, what are the consequences of Provincial Court Judge’s failure to do so? The facts are brief and not in dispute. The Appellant appeared unrepresented by Counsel in Provincial Court in Port Hood on March 31, 1998. He was read the charge in English by the Learned Provincial Court Judge. The Appellant pleaded not guilty to Section 266 of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court Judge set the trial for October 13, 1998, without advising the Appellant of his rights to trial in French or English pursuant to Section 531(1) and (2) of the Criminal Code contrary to Section 530(3) of the Criminal Code. The trial was held in English on October 13, 1998. At trial, the Appellant was represented by Counsel. At the conclusion of the trial, the Provincial Court Judge found the Appellant guilty of assault and imposed fine of $560.00 plus 12 months probation with conditions. The sole ground of appeal relates to the failure of the Provincial Court Judge to advise the Appellant of his rights to trial in French or English pursuant to Section 530 of the Code. Subsection 530(3) of the Criminal Code reads: “The justice of the peace or provincial court judge before whom the accused first appears shall, if the accused is not represented by counsel, advise the accused of his right to apply for an order under subsection (1) or (2) and of the time before which such an application must be made.” (Emphasis added) Subsections 530(1) and (2) of the Criminal Code read: “530(1) Language of accused On application by an accused whose language is one of the official languages of Canada, made not later than (a) time of the appearance of the accused at which his trial date is set, if (i) he is accused of an offence mentioned in section 553 or punishable on summary conviction, or (ii) the accused is to be tried on an indictment preferred under section 557, (b) the time of his election, if the accused is ordered to stand trial, if the accused elects under section 536 to be tried by provincial court judge, or (c) the time when the accused is ordered to stand trial, if the accused (i) is charged with an offence listed in section 469, (ii) has elected to be tried by court composed of judge or judge and jury, or (iii) is deemed to have elected to be tried by court composed of judge and jury, justice of the peace or provincial court judge shall grant an order directing that the accused be tried before justice of the peace, provincial court judge, judge or judge and jury, as the case may be, who speak the official language of Canada that is the language of the accused or, if the circumstances warrant, who speak both official languages of Canada. (Emphasis added) (2) Idem On application by an accused whose language is not one of the official languages of Canada, made not later than whichever of the times referred to in paragraphs (1)(a) to (c) is applicable, justice of the peace or provincial court judge may grant an order directing that the accused by tried before justice of the peace, provincial court judge, judge or judge and jury, as the case may be, who speak the official language of Canada in which the accused, in the opinion of the justice or provincial court judge, can best give testimony or, if the circumstances warrant, who speak both official languages of Canada.” Subsection 530(3) of the Criminal Code is mandatory. The word “shall” imposes statutory obligation on the trial judge or justice of the peace before whom an unrepresented accused first appears to advise him of his rights under Subsections 530(1) and (2) of the Code as the case may be. In R. v. Beaulac [1999] C.C.J. No. 25, File No. 26416, rendered May 20, 1999, Justice Bastarache of the Supreme Court of Canada states that language rights are not passive rights and these can only be “enjoyed” by the linguistic minority if the state takes positive steps to ensure that these rights are provided: “[para20] ... The objective of protecting official language minorities, as set out in s. of the Official Languages Act, is realized by the possibility for all members of the minority to exercise independent, individual rights which are justified by the existence of the community. Language rights are not negative rights, or passive rights; they can only be enjoyed if the means are provided. This is consistent with the notion favoured in the area of international law that the freedom to choose is meaningless in the absence of duty of the State to take positive steps to implement language guarantees; see J.E. Oestreich, ‘Liberal Theory and Minority Group Rights’ (1999), 21 Human Rts. Q. 108, at p. 112; P. Jones, ‘Human Rights, Group Rights, and Peoples’ Rights’ (1999), 21 Human Rts. Q. 80, at p. 83: ‘[A] right ... is conceptually tied to duty’; and B. Cholewinski, ‘State Duty Towards Ethnic Minorities: Positive or Negative?’ (1988), 10 Human Rts. Q. 344.” In Beaulac, supra, the accused’s request under Section 530(4) to be tried before judge and jury who spoke both official languages of Canada had been denied because his first trial was held in English and the accused could speak English. The Supreme Court of Canada held that under Section 430(4) his request for new trial should have been accepted. Justice Bastarache in Beaulac, supra, at paragraph 37 of the decision reviews the obligations of the Court with regards to language rights in dealing with the definition of “best interest of justice”: “[para37] In order to determine the proper definition that is applicable, the object of s. 530 must again be considered. Since the rule is the automatic access to trial in one’s official language when an application is made in timely manner, and discretionary access when such an application is not timely, the trial judge should therefore consider, foremost, the reasons for the delay. The first inquiry that comes to mind is directed at the knowledge of the right by the accused. When was he or she made aware of his or her right? Did he or she waive the right and later change his or her mind? Why did he or she change his or her mind? Was it because of difficulties encountered during the proceedings? ‘It is worth mentioning at this point that the right of the accused to be informed of his or her right under s. 530(3) is of questionable value because it applies only when the accused is unrepresented....’” (Emphasis added) Beaulac, supra, thus makes it clear that the Court must advise an unrepresented accused of his or her right to trial in either official language or, for that matter, to bilingual trial. The ability of an accused to speak or understand English is of no importance because violation of Section 530 is not procedural error. Justice Bastarache makes the following observation in Beaulac, supra, at paragraph 45: “[para45] In the present instance, much discussion was centered on the ability of the accused to express himself in English. This ability is irrelevant because the choice of language is not meant to support the legal right to fair trial, but to assist the accused in gaining equal access to public service that is responsive to his linguistic and cultural identity. It would indeed be surprising if Parliament intended that the right of bilingual Canadians should be restricted ... when in fact official language minorities, who have the highest incidence of bilingualism (84 percent for francophones living outside Quebec compared to percent for anglophones according to Statistics Canada 1996 Census), are the first persons that the section was designed to assist.” (Emphasis added) In Beaulac, supra, Justice Bastarache reviews the importance of language rights for the official language communities: “[para17] ... the new language cases are significant because they re-affirm the importance of language rights as supporting official language communities and their culture. In Ford v. Quebec (Attorney General), 1988 CanLII 19 (SCC), [1988] S.C.R. 712, at pp. 748-49, the Court wrote: ‘Language is so intimately related to the form and content of expression that there cannot be true freedom of expression by means of language if one is prohibited from using the language of one’s choice. Language is not merely means or medium of expression; it colours the content and meaning of expression. It is, as the preamble of the Charter of the French Language itself indicates, means by which people may express its cultural identity. It is also the means by which the individual expresses his or her personal identity and sense of individuality.’” Further, in Beaulac, supra, the Supreme Court of Canada in reviewing the definition of the expression “language of the accused” in the context of Section 530, also clarified the purpose of the Section which is to assist official language minorities in preserving their cultural identity: “[para34] The solution to the problem, in my view, is to look at the purpose of s. 530. It is, as mentioned earlier, to provide equal access to the courts to accused persons speaking one of the official languages of Canada in order to assist official language minorities in preserving their cultural identity; Ford, supra, at p. 749. The language of the accused is very personal in nature; it is an important part of his or her cultural identity. The accused must therefore be afforded the right to make choice between the two official languages based on his or her subjective ties with the language itself. The principles upon which the language is founded, the fact that the basic right is absolute, the requirement of equality with regard to the provision of services in both official languages of Canada and the substantive nature of the right all point to the freedom of Canadians to freely assert which official language is their own language.” (Emphasis added) In conclusion, the Trial Judge had no discretion and therefore was obligated to put to the unrepresented Appellant the right to be tried in either of the official languages of Canada or both. The failure by the Trial Judge to advise the Appellant in accordance with Section 530(3) of the Code constitutes breach of the Appellant’s rights under Sections 15, 16 and 19 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Those Sections read as follows: 15(1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. (2) Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. (1) English and French are the official languages of Canada and have equality of status and equal rights and privileges as to their use in all institutions of the Parliament and government of Canada. (3) Nothing in this Charter limits the authority of Parliament or legislature to advance the equality of status or use of English and French. 19(1) Either English or French may be used by any person in, or in any pleading in or process issuing from, any court established by Parliament. (2) Either English or French may be used by any person in, or in any pleading in or process issuing from, any court of New Brunswick. In this case, the Appellant’s mother tongue is French and the fact that the Trial Judge did not advise him of his rights to trial in his own language is not procedural error. At paragraph 24 in Beaulac, supra, the Supreme Court of Canada noted the following: ... The idea that s. 16(3) of the Charter, which has formalized the notion of advancement of the objective of equality of the official languages of Canada in the Jones case, supra, limits the scope of s. 16(1) must also be rejected. This subsection affirms the substantive equality of those constitutional language rights that are in existence at given time. Section of the Official Languages Act has the same effect with regard to rights recognized under that Act. This principle of substantive equality has meaning. It provides in particular that language rights that are institutionally based require government action for their implementation and therefore create obligations for the state: ... [para28] Section 530(1) creates an absolute right of the accused to equal access to designated courts in the official language that he or she considers to be his or her own. The courts called upon to deal with criminal matters are therefore required to be institutionally bilingual in order to provide for the equal use of the two official languages of Canada. In my view, this is substantive right and not procedural one that can be interfered with.” (Emphasis added) In Beaulac, supra, the Court concluded that violation of Section 530 constitutes substantial wrong which precludes the Appeal Court from dismissing the appeal pursuant to Section 686 of the Code: [para54] Given the nature of language rights, the requirement of substantive equality, the purpose of s. 530, as described here, and the objective of s. 686, believe that the violation of s. 530 constitutes substantial wrong and not procedural irregularity. Accordingly, s. 686(1)(b) has no application in this case and new trial must be ordered. Clearly, there must be an effective remedy available for breach of s. 530 rights. The application of the s. 686 proviso would make it illusory.” (Emphasis added) In view of the foregoing, I would allow the appeal and order a new trial. Order accordingly. J.

➢ The Tribunal erred in law in ruling that Mr. Kivela made his complaint within the Code’s limitation period.
➢ The Tribunal erred in law in failing to recognize the legal significance of Mr. Kivela’s resignation from his employment with the City.

Linda Alice Cournoyer, 2003NSSC092 Date: 20030507 Docket: 166177 Registry: Halifax Between: Warren Wright, Blaine Arthur Wright, Murray Allison Wright, Brenda Anne Doherty, and Jean Cleary v. Linda Alice Cournoyer Defendant Judge: The Honourable Justice Frank Edwards Heard: April 15, 16 17, 2003, in Halifax, Nova Scotia Counsel: Ms. Helen L. Foote, for the Plaintiffs Colin D. Bryson, Esq., for the Defendant By the Court: [1] The Plaintiffs seek a detailed accounting from their sister of her dealings with their mother’s financial affairs pursuant to a Power of Attorney. The Plaintiffs are five of the children of Bessy Marion Wright who died on August 8, 1999, at the age of 86. From 1992 until her death, Ms. Wright lived with her daughter, Linda Cournoyer, the Defendant. [2] On November 12, 1992, Ms. Wright gave the Defendant general Power of Attorney. As well, from 1992 onward, the Defendant’s name was also on Ms. Wright’s bank account. The bank account was used solely for Ms. Wright’s money, there being no co-mingling of any of Ms. Cournoyer’s money in this account. All monies that remained in this account at the time of Ms. Wright’s death were transferred to an estate account. [3] Ms. Wright executed her last Will and Testament on December 13, 1996. Probate of the Will was granted to Linda Alice Cournoyer as Executrix on September 29, 1999. Ms. Cournoyer filed an inventory with the Probate Court showing her mother’s assets at the time of her death totalled $56,089.74. The Plaintiffs expected that there would be assets in excess of $100,000.00. The basis of the Plaintiffs’ expectation is that their mother had sold two properties she owned respectively on November 13, 1992, and March 1, 1993. The net proceeds from the former sale was $49,897.25 and from the latter, $51,037.83. In addition, their mother also collected pensions ranging between approximately $1,100.00 per month to $1,300.00 per month from 1992 until her death. The Plaintiffs were aware that Ms. Cournoyer was charging her mother approximately $500.00 rent per month. They feel therefore that their mother should have been able to live solely on her pension income without ever having to have touched the principal from the proceeds of the sale of her two properties. In short, they believe that approximately $50,000.00 of their mother’s money is missing. [4] The Defendant’s position is that her mother was mentally competent and completely able to manage her own financial affairs from 1992 until her death in 1999. Ms. Cournoyer says that the reason for the Power of Attorney and the joint bank account was her mother’s convenience. Ms. Wright was physically infirmed and unable to easily get back and forth to a bank. Ms. Cournoyer would cash cheques for her mother or make cash withdrawals at her mother’s request and bring the money to her. She says that her mother received the bank statement at the end of each month and was well able to read and understand the bank statements. She says that on all occasions the money was withdrawn at her mother’s instruction. Ms. Cournoyer testified that her mother had excess funds for the first time in her life after the sale of her two properties. She was generous person who shared her new-found prosperity with others, especially her church and members of Ms. Cournoyer’s family, including Ms. Cournoyer herself. [5] In December 1994, Ms. Wright lent Ms. Cournoyer and her husband $19,000.00 to purchase new motor vehicle. Ms. Cournoyer testified that her mother had wished to give her the money for the car but that Ms. Cournoyer refused and took loan instead. She says she repaid approximately $2,000.00 and deposited the remaining $17,000.00 in the estate account after her mother died. [6] On the issue of Ms. Wright’s competency, heard evidence from her family doctor, Dr. Hilda Fox. Dr. Fox was Ms. Wright’s family doctor between 1988 and 1999. Dr. Fox’s records show that she saw Ms. Wright 36 times between 1996 and 1999. The essence of Dr. Fox’s evidence is that Bessy Wright displayed no evidence of any mental incompetence. In that regard, her evidence is consistent with that of Linda Cournoyer and Linda Cournoyer’s 21 year old daughter, Celine Cournoyer. also heard from Barbara Gidney, 43 year old lady who has known Bessy Wright for eight years prior to her death. Ms. Gidney had regular visits with Ms. Wright as part of regular church fellowship. She was confident that Ms. Wright was mentally alert. [7] The only evidence which suggested Ms. Wright was not mentally competent was that of the Plaintiff, Brenda Anne Doherty. Ms. Doherty described two telephone conversations with her mother. On one occasion, her mother apparently forgot to whom she was speaking, and in another, forgot that she had received package sent few days before by Ms. Doherty. These instances were put to Dr. Fox on cross-examination. In Dr. Fox’s opinion, such lapses are normal and are not concern unless they are repeated “over and over again”. [8] I have no difficulty in concluding that Bessy Wright was mentally competent at the time of her death. As such, she had the ability to manage her own financial affairs and to spend or give away her money as she pleased. As far as Linda Cournoyer is concerned, she could only be called upon to account for her use of he Power of Attorney if she had used the Power of Attorney during the incapacity of her mother. [9] Section of the Powers of Attorney Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 352 reads as follows: “5.(1) Where donor of an enduring power of attorney becomes legally incapacitated, judge of the Trial Division of the Supreme Court may for cause, on application, (a) require the attorney to have accounts passed for any transaction in involving the exercise of the power during the incapacity of the donor; (b) require the attorney to attend to sow cause for the attorney’s failure to do anything that the attorney is required to do as attorney or any order made pursuant to this Act; 5.(2) Where an attorney is ordered to have accounts passed, the attorney shall submit the accounts for approval to the Court or, where judge of the Court so orders, to the Public Trustee at such intervals as the judge may order and, when approved, the attorney shall file the accounts with the Prothonotary of the Supreme Court for the county where the application is heard.” [10] Accordingly, I am dismissing the Plaintiffs’ action. Ms. Wright never suffered from any mental incapacity during her life time and therefore Ms. Cournoyer is not required to account to the Plaintiffs for her dealings with her mother’s finances. [11] As the successful litigant, Ms. Cournoyer is entitled to her costs which assess on the basis of an amount involved of $50,000.00. Under Scale of Tariff “A” she is therefore entitled to $4,875.00 in costs plus reasonable disbursements to be taxed. The Plaintiffs are jointly and severely liable for payment of these costs which may be deducted from their respective entitlements in the estate. Order accordingly.",8_2003nssc92.txt,"The plaintiffs sought a detailed accounting from their sister of her dealings with their mother's financial affairs pursuant to a Power of Attorney prior to the mother's death.

[2] In this case, the landlord, Western Christian College, made an application pursuant to ss. 68(2)(a)(iv) of the Act, for an order for possession of the tenant’s rental unit.

GUNN REDACTED VERSION QUEEN’S BENCH FOR SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2016 SKQB 154 Date: 2016 05 02 Docket: FSM 55 of 2013 Judicial Centre: Regina, Family Law Division IN THE MATTER OF HEARING UNDER THE CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT, SS 1989-90, C-7.2 AND IN THE MATTER OF THE CHILD: J.G. BORN …, 2001 H.G., BORN…, 2003 Counsel: Karen Hindle and Michael Morris for the Ministry Sherri Woods for the children JUDGMENT MEGAW J. MAY 2, 2016 INTRODUCTION [1] The Ministry seeks permanent wardship order with respect to two children. The parents of the children, despite being more or less involved with the proceedings for some of the period of time, did not appear for the trial of the action. While this failure to show was unfortunate, it does not change the obligation of the court with respect to the decision to be made. Accordingly, the Ministry presented its evidence completely and provided full and complete argument in support of its recommendation in this matter. Similarly, counsel for the children participated fully in the trial process and presented argument in advocating for the interests of the children. [2] Decisions like those the court is called upon to make in this case are difficult. They are life altering for so many people: the children, their parents, the extended family, the childcare workers, the foster parents and their extended family. These decisions are sometimes made more difficult when the confluence of scarcity of both financial and personal resources, lack of urgency and lack of attention cause the initial problems to become more perplexing, if not insurmountable. This confluence is present not necessarily through the fault of the principal actors. Rather, it is present because circumstances dictate it to be so. [3] While happy is not word often seen in these judgments, happily that confluence did not occur here. Rather, from tragic and wrong beginning, all of the necessary stars have lined up. The children have proven resilient. The right child protection team was put in place and remained in place. The right professional assistance was sought out and remained committed to these children. Last, but by no means least, the right foster parents were located and the children were allowed to remain in this consistent loving care throughout their time as wards of the Ministry. [4] give this long introduction because there are cases where no satisfactory results have occurred with children and the involvement of the Ministry. In the case before me, good people have done good work on behalf of good children, who absolutely deserve the work that was done. [5] There are two children involved in this matter: J.G., born …, 2001 and H.G., born …, 2003. Their parents are C.G. and S.G. C.G. had been peripherally involved with the raising of these children. Until July 7, 2013, S.G. had been the primary caregiver for both J.G. and H.G. [6] On July 7, 2013, the lives of these children changed indelibly. On that night, they were assaulted by their father. He had returned to the home intoxicated. He had taken turns assaulting first J.G. and then H.G. As one child attempted to assist the other, they were subjected to further assaults. At the time, the children were 12 and years old. While it appears from the materials both of these children had previously been subjected to their father’s physical manifestation of his anger, it appears this was the night when action was taken. [7] As result of complaint to the police by concerned neighbour, officers attended and arrested S.G. for the assault on his two children. Mobile Crisis attended the home and apprehended the two children. S.G. was taken to cells. The children were taken to foster home located in the Gravelbourg, Saskatchewan vicinity. The foster parents were T.A. and [8] S.G. pled guilty to the assaults very soon after he was charged. He was sentenced to period of six months incarceration with probation to follow. Shortly thereafter, he pled guilty to previous domestic violence assault on his then partner and received an additional eight month term of incarceration. It appears from the material filed he has history of violent behaviour on various parties, from his children, through his then partners to his parents. It appears most, if not all, of his violent behaviours are directed at either women or children. It further appears he has provided little to the Ministry to indicate he has either learned from his violent past or has taken steps to discover strategies to overcome his difficulties. [9] C.G. has been, for the most part, an absentee parent. The Ministry learned she suffers from addiction issues. She was described by S.G. as being “crack head” in one of his discussions with Ministry personnel. Following the apprehension of the children, the Ministry arranged for seven visits between C.G. and the children. C.G. managed to attend four. While those visits were reported to have gone very well, there have been no visits since November, 2013 and there have been no requests for visits since that time. The missed visits had an adverse emotional reaction on the children. C.G. has not been heard from since that time and her whereabouts are unknown. [10] S.G. has had no visits with the children. Application was made to court to attempt to compel visits. The application was denied by the court. The view of Ministry staff and healthcare professionals was that visitations with S.G. were not in the best interests of these children. However, in December, 2014, following consultation with the healthcare professional, S.G. was permitted to provide letter to each of the children. They, in turn, provided their response. There has been no further direct contact since that time. It appears for brief period of time J.G. may have had “Facebook” contact, but he has since deleted that from his “Facebook” account. [11] Following the initial apprehension, the Ministry made application for four month temporary order with respect to the children. That order was granted by Danyliuk J. on August 6, 2013. Following the expiry of that order, the Ministry made application for further three month temporary order. That order was granted by Kraus J. on December 31, 2013. The temporary orders were sought, not because the Ministry was considering return of the children to the parents, but rather because the Ministry was of the view they needed an opportunity to determine what steps should be taken to advance the best interests of these children. The Ministry determined to pursue permanent wardship order on April 8, 2014. [12] The child protection file was originally handled by Ashley Young of the Regina Children’s Justice Centre. She was the child protection arm of the Centre, working in conjunction with the Regina City Police, as these children had been abused. The actual child protection worker assigned was Kim Schleede and she remained involved in the file through to very recently. The file was transferred to child protection worker Jennifer Bender in early November, 2015. Despite this transfer, it appears Ms. Schleede stayed involved in her new role as an assistant supervisor still in child protection services. [13] Ms. Schleede was involved in setting up the visitations with C.G. She was also involved in discussions with S.G. During her discussions with S.G., he was variously interested in the children and interested in berating Ms. Schleede through the use of vulgar and inappropriate language. Presumably these instances were but continuation of his assault on others, and women in particular. [14] When the children were initially apprehended, they were examined in the Emergency Ward of the Regina General Hospital. The attending physician’s reports were submitted in evidence (Exhibit M1, Tabs 10(a) and (b)). In both cases, number of bruises were found on both the children’s faces and torsos. These bruises, in the opinion of the physician, confirmed the accounts given by the children that they were kicked and struck by their father on the night of July 7, 2013. [15] Incidentally, while S.G. did plead guilty to these assaults, he resiled from that guilt in his conversations with Ms. Schleede. To her, he denied having assaulted the children and suggested he pled guilty to avoid the children having to testify in the matter. Additionally, and much more disconcerting, he told her that if, in fact, he had kicked and struck the children the number of times they alleged, “they would be dead.” Chilling is an appropriate word to describe this conversation. [16] The child protection worker, Ms. Schleede, had discussion with C.G. at the time of the pre-trial conference. Ms. Schleede recounted C.G. had indicated she had run into extreme difficulty with the individual who supplied her with her drugs and also with law enforcement. She was apparently heavily involved in the drug scene and was both accused and witness in some type of criminal proceedings. This information is quite incomplete. It may be concluded C.G. was experiencing ongoing addictions issues and was in no position to be parenting these children, even had she indicated desire to so parent. [17] Both children were referred to registered psychologist, Shantelle Szuch. She began seeing the children in November, 2013. She was qualified as an expert in the area of child and adolescent psychology, including trauma focused therapy. She engaged this form of therapy with these children. She worked with both the children and the foster mother through to mid-March, 2015. She continues to work with all of them, but now on an as needed basis. This move to non-treatment is in accordance with the generally accepted professional view that it is not appropriate to “keep clients in ongoing, long term therapy once improvement has been observed.” (Exhibit M1, Tab 17, Letter of Shantelle Szuch) [18] And, according to the evidence, improvement was shown. Both children initially presented as angry, aggressive and scared. They reacted inappropriately emotionally and, on occasion, physically. Ms. Szuch determined these reactions were caused by the trauma they had been exposed to. J.G. was difficult to handle and was on the verge of being expelled from his new school. H.G. was reacting badly at her new home. To top matters off, H.G. was determined to be cognitively delayed and was functioning at an age considerably less than her chronological age. Her intellectual skills were quite stunted. As an aside, the psychologist was unable to assist on whether this intellectual deficit was the result of organic circumstances or the trauma to which she had been exposed. [19] This then brings me to the foster parents. In this case, the court was treated to hearing evidence from T.A. Without reservation, am able to say this individual is genuinely committed to the welfare of the children in her charge. She is devoted, in particular, to the two children in issue here. Through the course of her time as foster parent, she has had some 150 children involved in the system go through her home. cannot help but think those children are the better for their stay with her and her family. [20] At the present time, T.A. and her husband have 10 children living in their home: four are their biological children; five are foster children; and, one is adopted following being foster child. The children range in age from 11 to 18 years old. She testified that when J.G. and H.G. first came to them, there were emotional and physical outbursts. While she was understated in her comments, it is surmised this initial period was quite difficult. She was involved in their home life, their school life and their treatment with Ms. Szuch. [21] Throughout the time T.A. and K.A. have been involved with these children, it appears the kids have made nothing short of remarkable turnaround. While things are not perfect, as few familial relations are, they are certainly markedly better and continually moving in the right direction. The children call their foster parents mother and father. J.G. has developed into quite the little athlete and is doing exceedingly well academically. H.G. is getting assistance with her intellectual difficulties. She is involved in extra-curricular activities such as dancing. Both have positive peer roles in the home and have developed quite close bonds with the other children in the home. [22] T.S. gave her evidence in an exceedingly understated and humble manner. She was quite matter of fact in recounting her involvement in the turnaround of these children. But, she was quite pointed in providing the before and after picture for these kids. Her work with these children is nothing short of remarkable. Both have developed deep emotional bond with her. H.G. in particular is very attached. The children are lucky to have her in their lives. It appears she feels lucky to have these children, and the others in her brood, in her life. [23] Dr. Greenough, registered doctoral psychologist, was retained by the Ministry to complete parenting capacity assessment report to assist in formulating plan for the children. His report was marked as Exhibit M8 at the trial. His recommendations were blunt, the children should not be returned to their father’s care now, or in the foreseeable future. Further, he was not in support of the father having any access to the children. In his words, such access “will exacerbate their trauma and compromise their movement to healthy adjustment.” [24] The children were represented by counsel and have had the benefit of that consistent counsel for in excess of two years. Ms. Woods, in her role as advocate for the children, advised they wish to remain living with their foster parents. The children are concerned about the outcome of this trial and the continuing uncertainty of their permanent living arrangements. The foster mother confirmed the children have advised her they seek to remain living in her home. This information has also been provided to the child protection workers. [25] As indicated, the parents did not participate in the trial. was advised by counsel neither parent had contact with the Ministry for some period of time. While unfortunate, counsel did good job of marshalling the evidence and ensuring complete picture was presented to the court. While it would have been preferable to have heard from the parents, am satisfied received all of the available evidence concerning these children. [26] The Ministry seeks permanent order with respect to these children. Such an order removes all parental rights to the children and would come without conditions attached. The only real alternative on the facts presented here is long-term order. This type of order would preserve parental rights and would also leave open the door for variation application down the road. While there are other options in The Child and Family Services Act, SS 1989-90, C-7.2 [Act], like return of the children to their parents or an ongoing temporary order, none are appropriate on the facts of this case. Similarly, there is no indication of any person being available from the parents’ families to take responsibility for these children. [27] The method to be used to analyse case is set forth in (Re) S.F., 2009 SKCA 121 (CanLII), 343 Sask 112 [S.F.] and Saskatchewan (Minister of Social Services) E.K.S. (1996), 1996 CanLII 7131 (SK QB), 146 Sask 46 (QB) [E.K.S.] and (Re) T.C., 2014 SKQB 115 (CanLII), 444 Sask 10. It was most recently set forth in the decision of (Re) N.B., 2015 SKQB 171 (CanLII). [28] The first step is to determine whether the child is in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. finding of such need requires the court to then look to s. 37 of the Act to determine the type of order to put in place. In considering that order, the court may consider the recommendation of the Ministry but will be guided by the best interests of the child as set forth in s. of the Act. [29] These various considerations occur against the overarching principle set forth in s. of the Act: The purpose of this Act is to promote the well-being of children in need of protection by offering, wherever appropriate, services that are designed to maintain, support and preserve the family in the least disruptive manner. [30] The determination of whether child is in need of protection is arrived at from review of the items set forth in s. 11: 11 child is in need of protection where: (a) as result of action or omission by the child’s parent: (i) the child has suffered or is likely to suffer physical harm; (ii) the child has suffered or is likely to suffer serious impairment of mental or emotional functioning; (iii) the child has been or is likely to be exposed to harmful interaction for sexual purpose, including involvement in prostitution and including conduct that may amount to an offence within the meaning of the Criminal Code; (iv) medical, surgical or other recognized remedial care or treatment that is considered essential by duly qualified medical practitioner has not been or is not likely to be provided to the child; (v) the child’s development is likely to be seriously impaired by failure to remedy mental, emotional or developmental condition; or (vi) the child has been exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony that is likely to result in physical or emotional harm to the child; (b) there is no adult person who is able and willing to provide for the child’s needs, and physical or emotional harm to the child has occurred or is likely to occur; or (c) the child is less than 12 years of age and: (i) there are reasonable and probable grounds to believe that: (A) the child has committed an act that, if the child were 12 years of age or more, would constitute an offence under the Criminal Code, the Narcotic Control Act (Canada) or Part III or Part IV of the Food and Drug Act (Canada); and (B) family services are necessary to prevent recurrence; and (ii) the child’s parent is unable or unwilling to provide for the child’s needs. [31] The best interests of the children are arrived at by considering the specific direction of s. 4: Where person or court is required by any provision of this Act other than subsection 49(2) to determine the best interests of child, the person or court shall take into account: (a) the quality of the relationships that the child has with any person who may have close connection with the child; (b) the child’s physical, mental and emotional level of development; (c) the child’s emotional, cultural, physical, psychological and spiritual needs; (d) the home environment proposed to be provided for the child; (e) the plans for the care of the child of the person to whom it is proposed that the custody of the child be entrusted; (f) where practicable, the child’s wishes, having regard to the age and level of the child’s development; (g) the importance of continuity in the child’s care and the possible effect on the child of disruption of that continuity; and (h) the effect on the child of delay in making decision. [32] In an oft-quoted passage, the Court of Appeal, in S.F., agreed with McIntyre J.’s determination in E.K.S. in outlining the principles to be applied in deciding the options available under s. 37 of the Act to carry out those best interests of the child (at para. 29): 29 In E.K.S. McIntyre J. set out the principles to be followed by court when determining whether any options available in s. 37(1) are appropriate as follows: 1. The welfare of the child is the paramount (but not the sole) consideration. The wishes of the parent must be given independent subordinate weight. The weight will depend on the circumstances in each case. (R. v. Saskatchewan (Minister of Social Services), 1974 CanLII 959 (SK QB), [1974] W.W.R. 388, at p. 393 (Sask. Q.B.)) 2. Section 37(4)(a) does not declare that only the best interests of the child shall be considered. The implication is that the court may be mindful of other matters. As well, the list in s. is not exhaustive in determining the best interests of the child. (Saskatchewan (Minister of Social Services) v. R.G. (1990), 1990 CanLII 7428 (SK QB), 88 Sask. R. 262 (U.F.C.)) 3. Any determination made must be in the context of the objective of the Act, set out in s. 3. (M.A.C.) v. Saskatchewan (Minister of Social Services) (1993), 1993 CanLII 9025 (SK QB), 110 Sask. R. 81; 46 R.F.L. (3d) 174 (Q.B.)) 4. The court may consider the recommendation of the officer (representative of the Department) but is not bound thereby. 5. The court, having determined the child to be in need of protection, has determined that the level of parenting care is below the minimum tolerated by society. Therefore, in determining whether an order under s. 37(1) is appropriate, including conditions which could be attached, the court must be satisfied either: (a)The parent or parents have altered his or her ways such that the circumstances which gave rise to the determination that the child was in need of protection no longer exist, or (b)The court is satisfied that there is realistic plan or reasonable basis upon which to conclude that the necessary changes can occur within reasonable time whereby the children can be safely returned to the care of their parent or parents. (Saskatchewan (Minister of Social Services) v. A.J. and C.J. (1987), 1987 CanLII 4660 (SK CA), 58 Sask. R. 246 (C.A.); Saskatchewan (Minister of Social Services) v. M.L. and M.L.M. (1988), 1988 CanLII 4925 (SK QB), 71 Sask. R. 110 (U.F.C.); M.A.C. v. Saskatchewan (Minister of Social Services), supra; Saskatchewan (Minister of Social Services) v. R.G., supra.) [50] The court must look at various factors including (without meaning to be exhaustive of the possibilities) any changes in circumstance or conduct of the parent that has occurred or is proposed, any plan of corrective action that is being advanced, the nature of any resources suggested and the time frames which may be involved. The options in s. 37(1) are premised upon reasonable prospect of change, within reasonable length of time and reasonable use of resources if needed. [51] In making an assessment as to whether an order under s. 37(1) is appropriate the court must do so on the basis of the evidence before it. As noted by the Court of Appeal in Saskatchewan (Minister of Social Services) v. A.J. and C.J., supra, p. at 251: ""However, the following is self-evident. Where, as here, children have been placed into the temporary custody of the Minister, and the parents wish to have the children returned to them, they must make efforts to improve or remove the conditions or circumstances in the home which have resulted in the children being taken from the parents ..."" [52] Counsel for the department said ""good intentions are not sufficient"" and relied upon the following observations of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Children's Aid Society of Winnipeg v. Redwood (1980), 19 R.F.L. (2d) 232 (Man. C.A.), at p. 234: ""... The test is: What is in the best interests of these children, and not whether the mother has merely seen the light and is now prepared to be good mother, while in the past, on her own admission, she was not such. The test is whether the mother has in fact turned new leaf and whether she is now able to give to the children the care which is in their best interests. Good intentions are not sufficient. As the chief justice of this court, speaking in an unanimous decision in another case, stated so ably: 'to give this mother another chance is to give these children one less chance in life.'"" [53] The foregoing comments must be applied with caution. agree that good intentions by themselves are not sufficient. The question in every instance must be whether, on all of the evidence before the court, the court is satisfied sufficient change can occur within the context of an order under s. 37(1) such that it is in the best interests of the child to make such an order. Given the objective of the Act as set out in s. 3, permanent committal does not ipso facto follow just because the parent has not yet turned that new leaf. [33] In the case before me, I conclude these children, as at the date of the expiry of the last order of Kraus J., continue to be children in need of protection. I arrive at this conclusion by applying ss. 11(a)(1) and (b). The evidence discloses the father has taken no measurable steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues. He has lengthy history of violent acts against those who are ill-positioned to defend against such violence. It appears this violence occurs when he is abstaining from alcohol (in the case of his last known partner) and when he is intoxicated (in the case of these children). His comments to the child protection worker in his telephone conversations, regrettably, confirm he continues to struggle with anger and violent emotions. [34] These children were subjected to violence on July 7, 2013. The statements of the children at that time suggest they had been subjected to this violence on previous occasions. Nothing has changed with the father. Accordingly these children continue to be in need of protection as they are likely to suffer physical harm at the hands of their father. [35] In addition, the children’s emotional and psychological state requires them to continue to be in need of protection. The evidence showed the children struggle on an ongoing basis from the trauma they experienced at the hands of their father. [36] As well, there does not appear to be any adult person able or willing to provide for their needs. As such, the children are further exposed to emotional and physical harm. The mother continues to suffer from addictions issues. She is engaged with the criminal justice system. She is involved in serious matters which, obviously, preclude the attention to children. The father has been absent from the children’s lives this entire period of time. [37] Neither parent has taken an active interest in these children for almost three years. The mother has had no contact with the children since missing her last visit at the end of 2013. The father, once the letters were written, has had no involvement with the Ministry. Neither appeared at the trial. It is apparent neither is available to care for these children. [38] The next step is to determine the appropriate order. As indicated, the recommendation of the Ministry is for permanent order. The best interests of these children compel such an order being made. arrive at this conclusion for the following reasons. [39] The children have developed close, loving bond with their foster parents. They have been in this relationship for almost three years. The efforts of both the children and their foster mother have achieved remarkable results. It is imperative in the lives of these children this relationship be continued and be made permanent. [40] J.G.’s intellectual and emotional development has seen steady trajectory upwards. He is bright young man and is doing very well in school. This development appears to have occurred since he was placed with the foster home. He is also learning to control his aggression and inappropriate behaviour. This is occurring through his hard work, but it is also occurring through the efforts of his foster parents and his support network. This support network includes Ms. Szuch, his school officials and the child protection workers. This development must be allowed to continue and that can only happen if he is committed permanently to the care of the Ministry in the hands of T.A. and K.A. [41] H.G.’s cognitive deficits are recognized and dealt with by the foster parents. While she struggles academically, all are working with her to develop her to her maximum potential. She is learning to control her aggression and outbursts. This occurs through the complete support network but appears to be principally the result of the loving, gentle but firm, guidance of T.A. This ongoing development can only happen if she is permanently committed to the care of the Ministry in the hands of T.A. and K.A.. [42] The proposal going forward is that both children will remain in the care of the foster parents. As T.A. put it in her evidence, she is committed to parenting these children through to their 18th birthday “and beyond”. She, and her husband, are these children’s parents for life. They have loving home in which appropriate behaviour, emotional development and academic achievement are emphasized and developed. Extra-curricular activities for all of the children, and for these two in particular, are plentiful and add to the development of both J.G. and H.G. [43] The children’s wishes, as expressed through T.A., the child protection team, Ms. Szuch and their counsel are that they wish to reside permanently with T.A. and K.A. J.G. puts it that he wants to change his last name to A. Their counsel describes J.G.’s wishes as informed. She describes H.G.’s wishes as being the practical result of what is in her best interests. Regardless, the clear wishes of these children, as expressed repeatedly and unwaveringly, is to reside permanently with their present parents. put weight on these wishes in making my decision. [44] The conclusion of Dr. Greenough is short and pointed: there is to be no further contact with the father. This conclusion of doctoral, registered psychologist carries weight in the circumstances before me. The children’s psychological best interests require permanent order to be made. [45] As indicated in the introduction, the continuity exhibited in this case is quite remarkable. It is tribute to those involved. More importantly, the children have been the real beneficiaries of this level of consistency and continuity. Their protection, mental health assistance, academic help, psychological assistance and parenting have been conducted cooperatively between the various agencies and persons. It is unusual to see this for whole host of reasons, none of which cast aspersions on any of the agencies involved. It obviously worked here and it is imperative this continuity continue into the future. [46] Finally, consider the effect of delay in making decision through long-term order. The children were aware this trial was approaching. It is appropriate in these circumstances that they did know. They were aware of their situation and information on the legal process allowed those advising and counselling them to include them in this process. [47] However, that knowledge brought with it anxiety. It resulted in reversion to some of the children’s previous behaviour. It appears, for these children to gain the full benefit of the situation in which they find themselves, they must know their situation is permanent. They must know their home is their family home and will not be changing now or in the future. Such further contact will practically be dictated by the children as they age. [48] For all of these reasons, I determine a permanent order with respect to these children is the appropriate order to make. have determined to make no additional recommendations to the Ministry. am mindful of the comments of Dr. Greenough and leave any further recommendations in the care of the Ministry. CONCLUSION [49] There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(2) of the Act permanently committing the children, J.G. and H.G., to the care of the Minister. am confident they are in good hands with T.A. and K.A. J. M. T. MEGAW",8_2016skqb154.txt,"HELD: The order was granted.
Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act.
As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands.
Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care.
Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order."

No.
This action involves a contest between two insurance companies.
It results from the loss by fire of a residence owned by Michael and Diane Brown which was subject to a mortgage in favour of Canada Trustco Mortgage Company.
At the time of the fire loss, there were in place two policies of insurance for the purpose of indemnifying Canada Trustco.
In advancing their claim against one insured, Canada Trustco failed to disclose the existence of the second policy.
One policy had been placed by the Owners/Mortgagors, Mr. and Mrs. Brown, and protected both their interests and the interests of the Mortgagee.
This policy was placed with The Co‑operators General Insurance Company.
The second policy was placed by Canada Trustco to protect its own interests as Mortgagee and was put in place as a result of notice that the Co-op policy was being cancelled by Co‑op.
This latter policy was placed with Marsh & McLennan and is a subscription policy.
Under the terms of the arrangement between Canada Trustco and Marsh & McLennan, coverage was put in place on the basis of notice from the mortgage company.

PUBLISHERS OF THIS CASE PLEASE TAKE NOTE THAT s. 110(1) and s. 111(1) of the YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT APPLIES AND MAY REQUIRE EDITING OF THIS JUDGMENT OR ITS HEADING BEFORE PUBLICATION. (1) Subject to this section, no person shall publish the name of young person, or any other information related to young person, if it would identify the young person as young person dealt with under this Act. (1) Subject to this section, no person shall publish the name of child or young person, or any other information related to child or young person, if it would identify the child or young person as having been victim of, or as having appeared as witness in connection with, an offence committed or alleged to have been committed by young person. Decision: [1] J.E.S., aged 16, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code. On July 15, 2009 he was sentenced by Youth Court Judge Jamie S. Campbell to serve total sentence of 365 days, comprised of 243 days custody followed by 122 days supervision in the community. Nine month’s credit was given for the six months he spent on remand, so the total sentence is, in effect, 21 months, four months of which is non-custodial. J.E.S. has appealed his sentence and applies for release pending appeal pursuant to s. 679 of the Criminal Code. The appeal has been scheduled to be heard on November 13, 2009. [2] Judge Campbell described the offence in the sentencing decision as follows: The crime here was of potentially lethal violence. The circumstances surrounding it are, to say the least, perplexing. It was not moment of poor judgement. It was not momentary lapse of self control. J.E.S. took gun in anticipation of fight. Apparently he made what he thought was pre-emptive strike, though it seems against young man he didn’t even know. [3] The victim of the crime was young person standing on street corner who was shot in the back with rifle fired by J.E.S. in drive-by shooting. [4] J.E.S. has appealed his sentence but not the conviction. The grounds of appeal are: 1. The learned Trial Judge emphasised the element of general deterrence when prohibited from doing so under the Y.C.J.A. 2. The learned Trial Judge imposed sentence which is clearly unfit under the principles of sentence under the Y.C.J.A., the preamble and the declaration of principles. [5] The relevant sections of the Criminal Code provide: 679 (1) judge of the court of appeal may, in accordance with this section, release an appellant from custody pending the determination of his appeal if, ... (b) in the case of an appeal to the court of appeal against sentence only, the appellant has been granted leave to appeal ... (4) In the case of an appeal referred to in paragraph (1)(b), the judge of the court of appeal may order that the appellant be released pending the determination of his appeal or until otherwise ordered by judge of the court of appeal if the appellant establishes that (a) the appeal has sufficient merit that, in the circumstances, it would cause unnecessary hardship if he were detained in custody; (b) he will surrender himself into custody in accordance with the terms of the order; and (c) his detention is not necessary in the public interest. [6] Further to s. 679(1)(b), and Civil Procedure Rule 91.24(1), it is necessary that leave to appeal be granted before release pending appeal. To grant leave, should be satisfied that the grounds are not frivolous and that they raise arguable issues: R. v. MacIntyre, 2003 NSCA 68 (CanLII), R. v. Smith, 2005 NSCA 45 (CanLII). The Crown does not oppose the leave application and am satisfied that the grounds of appeal are not frivolous, and therefore grant leave to appeal. [7] At the hearing of the bail application, counsel for the appellant called Mr. Mark Crosby of the Youth Probation Office as witness. Mr. Crosby testified that if J.E.S. is released pending appeal he would be accepted into the Youth Bail Supervision Program. That program provides for intensive supervision including weekly reporting in person, daily telephone contact, curfew checks, random home and school visits, and the use of an electronic GPS bracelet which continually tracks the location of the young person. J.E.S. and his mother have agreed to his participation in this program if he is released pending appeal. [8] Counsel for the appellant submitted that since the appellant is young person, s. 679 of the Criminal Code should be interpreted in accordance with the principles set out the Youth Criminal Justice Act. No authority, specific to release pending appeal, was cited by counsel to support this argument. One case found subsequent to the hearing, R. v. D. C., 2005 ABCA 280 (CanLII), does assist the appellant’s position. In that case, Berger, J.A. released the young person pending sentence appeal, after finding that strict conditions of release would “in all of the circumstances, best achieve the objects and purposes of the Youth Criminal Justice Act pending the Applicant’s appeal.” [See 8.] In that case, the young person had served all but seven weeks of six-month custodial sentence at the time of the application for release pending appeal. [9] will therefore be informed and guided by the principles as set out in s. of the Y.C.J.A. in determining whether the appellant should be released pending appeal. Those principles are stated as follows: (1) The following principles apply in this Act: (a) the youth criminal justice system is intended to (i) prevent crime by addressing the circumstances underlying young person's offending behaviour, (ii) rehabilitate young persons who commit offences and reintegrate them into society, and (iii) ensure that young person is subject to meaningful consequences for his or her offence in order to promote the long‑term protection of the public; (b) the criminal justice system for young persons must be separate from that of adults and emphasize the following: (i) rehabilitation and reintegration, (ii) fair and proportionate accountability that is consistent with the greater dependency of young persons and their reduced level of maturity, (iii) enhanced procedural protection to ensure that young persons are treated fairly and that their rights, including their right to privacy, are protected, (iv) timely intervention that reinforces the link between the offending behaviour and its consequences, and (v) the promptness and speed with which persons responsible for enforcing this Act must act, given young persons' perception of time; (c) within the limits of fair and proportionate accountability, the measures taken against young persons who commit offences should (i) reinforce respect for societal values, (ii) encourage the repair of harm done to victims and the community, (iii) be meaningful for the individual young person given his or her needs and level of development and, where appropriate, involve the parents, the extended family, the community and social or other agencies in the young person's rehabilitation and reintegration, and (iv) respect gender, ethnic, cultural and linguistic differences and respond to the needs of aboriginal young persons and of young persons with special requirements; and (d) special considerations apply in respect of proceedings against young persons and, in particular, (i) young persons have rights and freedoms in their own right, such as right to be heard in the course of and to participate in the processes, other than the decision to prosecute, that lead to decisions that affect them, and young persons have special guarantees of their rights and freedoms, (ii) victims should be treated with courtesy, compassion and respect for their dignity and privacy and should suffer the minimum degree of inconvenience as result of their involvement with the youth criminal justice system, (iii) victims should be provided with information about the proceedings and given an opportunity to participate and be heard, and (iv) parents should be informed of measures or proceedings involving their children and encouraged to support them in addressing their offending behaviour. (2) This Act shall be liberally construed so as to ensure that young persons are dealt with in accordance with the principles set out in subsection (1). [10] Most of these principles are more relevant at the pre-trial, trial and sentencing stages of proceeding than at this time. The appellant, J.E.S., has the onus of establishing each of the three conditions of s. 679(4) on balance of probabilities. In my view, none of the principles of the Y.C.J.A. dictate that the burden should be lessened or shifted to the Crown. The principles relevant to this matter require that deal with his application and set down the appeal as soon as possible, take into account the appellant’s reduced level of maturity, and ensure that he is treated fairly. [11] At this stage of the proceeding, the appellant no longer has the benefit of the presumption of innocence. The Crown is opposed to the release of the appellant, and submits that the appellant has not established any of the three conditions. [12] The “unnecessary hardship” condition was explained by Saunders J.A., in R. v. Bennett, 2006 NSCA 86 (CanLII): [16] In R. v. J.D., (1996) N.S.J. No. 176, Flinn, J.A. for this court discussed the threshold for establishing under s. 679(4)(a) whether an appeal is sufficiently meritorious that failure to allow bail pending appeal would cause unnecessary hardship. He quoted from The Law of Bail in Canada, (Gary T. Trotter, Toronto: Carswell, 1992), and agreed that the onus on an appellant under s. 679(4)(a) of the Criminal Code is “much more stringent” than for an appeal against conviction. He also implicitly accepted the following statement from that text at ¶23: The applicant must demonstrate that the appeal is sufficiently meritorious such that, if the accused is not released from custody, he or she will have already served the sentence as imposed, or what would have been fit sentence, prior to the hearing of the appeal. It prevents the applicant from serving more time in custody than that which is subsequently determined to be appropriate in the sense, there is unavoidable speculative dimension of this criterion. [13] J.E.S. says in his affidavit that he will suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody until his appeal is heard because he will fall behind in his schoolwork and be unable to complete his high school education in a timely fashion. Prior to being remanded, J.E.S. was not attending school because he had been asked to leave the high school he had previously attended as a result of concern for his and other students’ safety after threats had been made against him. While in custody at the Nova Scotia Youth Centre in Waterville, J.E.S. has been studying grade 10 Math and English and, according to his pre-sentence report, he also attends substance abuse and anger management programs. [14] The second condition that J.E.S. must meet is he would surrender himself in accordance with any release order. review of his record indicates that he has history of flaunting court orders. On the day that he committed the drive-by shooting in this case, he was on two probation orders that prohibited him from possessing firearms and was also subject to firearms prohibition order. As well, he was on an undertaking to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He has been convicted of five breaches of probation, two breaches of undertaking, and two resisting arrest/obstruction charges. Furthermore, he has prior record for violent offences. [15] J.E.S. must also prove that his detention is not necessary in the public interest. This condition was described by Justice Bateman recently in R. v. Marshall, 2008 NSCA 41 (CanLII): 24 In R. v. Demyen (1975), 1975 CanLII 1338 (SK CA), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 324 (Sask. C.A.), Culliton, C.J.S., in discussing the meaning of ""detention in the public interest"", said at p. 326: am convinced that the effective enforcement and administration of the criminal law can only be achieved if the Courts, Judges and police officers, and law enforcement agencies have and maintain the confidence and respect of the public. Any action by the Courts, Judges, police officers, or law enforcement agencies which may detrimentally affect that public confidence and respect would be contrary to the public interest.... (Cited with approval by Arbour J.A. in R. v. Farinacci, 1993 CanLII 3385 (ON CA), [1993] O.J. No. 2627 (Q.L.), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 32 (C.A.)). [16] The appellant J.E.S, has clearly not met all three requirements for release pending his sentence appeal. He is able to attend high school classes in the youth facility while he awaits his appeal, so he is making some progress towards his education. Although the number of subjects available is limited, he is receiving individualized attention several times week. Furthermore, even if his sentence appeal is successful, by the time the appeal is heard on November 13th, he will have only served about four months custody since the date of sentencing by the Youth Court. The appellant has not satisfied the onus which is upon him to establish that his appeal has sufficient merit that, in the circumstances, would cause unnecessary hardship if he were detained in custody until November. In coming to this conclusion have considered the serious nature of the offence here, the principles of the Y.C.J.A. listed above, the appellant’s criminal record, the reasons for sentence given by Judge Campbell, and the general reluctance of this Court to interfere with youth sentences unless it is clearly excessive or based on wrong principles. The appellant has not satisfied me that his appeal is sufficiently meritorious that, by the time his appeal is heard, he will likely already have served more than what is determined to be a fit sentence, and thereby suffer undue hardship if he is not released. [17] With respect to the second condition, in light of his pattern of flagrant disregard of court orders, am very concerned that the appellant would not abide by the conditions of any release order or surrender himself as required. However, the program described by Mr. Crosby certainly appears to provide much closer supervision than J.E.S. has had in the past, and J.E.S. professes to have “turned new leaf” regarding his former negative peer group. am therefore prepared to accept that the second condition has been met. [18] However, given the circumstances of the aggravated assault offence, his record of violent offences, and the numerous breaches of court orders, I am not persuaded that his release would be in the public interest. The appellant’s release so soon after being sentenced, in order for him to attend school in the community, would tend to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice. [19] The application for release pending appeal is therefore dismissed. Roscoe, J.A.",9_2009nsca91.txt,"The young person appealed his sentence on an aggravated assault conviction following a drive-by shooting and applied for release pending appeal.
Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school.
Application for release pending appeal dismissed.
The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard.

CLAES and NORMAN BEZANSON Respondents Robert L. Barnes and J. Kevin Quigley for the Appellant J. William Jordan, Q.C. for the Respondents Appeal Heard: March 12, 1993 Judgment Delivered: March 23, 1993 THE COURT: The appeal is allowed as per reasons for judgment of Chipman, J.A.; Clarke, C.J.N.S. and Matthews, J.A., concurring. CHIPMAN, J.A.: The appellant Prenor is a mortgagee which unsuccessfully sought a deficiency judgment against the respondent, Bezanson, a guarantor of the covenants of a mortgage given by Seawood Enterprises Ltd. to Prenor. The mortgage dated December 31, 1987 was for $400,000 given on the security of property which had been appraised at $538,000. The mortgage fell into arrears and Prenor commenced foreclosure proceedings on August 2, 1990 against Seawood, the respondent and one Claes, another guarantor. The statement of claim, to which no defence was filed, specifically claimed deficiency judgment against all three defendants. On Prenor's application, an order for foreclosure and sale was granted on August 23, 1990 and the sheriff's sale took place on October 2, 1990. Prenor, the only bidder at the sale, bought in the property at $10,731.84. Prenor then embarked on an extensive effort to recover its outlay by marketing the property. It finally sold it at price of $295,000 on November 1, 1991. Civil Procedure Rule 47.10(3) dealing with foreclosure proceedings provides with respect to deficiency judgment as follows: ""47.10(3) An application for deficiency judgment pursuant to sub‑paragraph (2), unless otherwise ordered by the court, shall be made within six months from the date of the Sheriff's Sale on ten days notice and any deficiency judgment allowed shall not exceed the difference between the amount realized by the plaintiff from the Sheriff's Sale and the amount owing to the plaintiff at that date determined in accordance with the provisions of the order for foreclosure and sale."" On October 17, 1991 Prenor obtained an order from the prothonotary confirming the sheriffs sale and purporting to grant leave to Prenor to apply for deficiency judgment within six months from the date thereof. On March 30, 1992 Prenor issued an interlocutory notice (application inter panes) for an order pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 47.10 for leave to enter deficiency judgment against the respondent. On May 19, 1992 an order was granted in chambers in the Supreme Court upon application of Prenor with the consent of the respondents' solicitor. It provided inter alia: ""NOW UPON IT APPEARING that it is appropriate to extend the time in which the Plaintiff may make an application for an order for deficiency judgment against the Defendants; NOW UPON MOTION: IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Plaintiff is granted an extension of time for the hearing of an application for an Order for deficiency judgment to hearing on the 27th day of May, A.D. 1992 at 11:00 o'clock in the forenoon until the conclusion of such hearing, or such further time as this Honourable Court may hereafter approve; AND IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Defendant, Norman Bezanson, shall have leave to file Defence to such application and shall be entitled to appear at the said hearing for the purpose of opposing the application;"" On May 21, 1992 the respondent filed defence, the essence of which was that Prenor neglected the property, as result of which the price obtained ($239,000) was significantly below the appraised value of $438,000 arrived at following the sheriffs sale. The defendant at no time pleaded that the application for deficiency judgment was out of time by reason of noncompliance with the Civil Procedure Rules. The matter was heard in chambers on July 6, 1992 and by oral decision rendered at the conclusion of the hearing and released in writing on August 14, 1992, the chambers judge dismissed the application. As to the issues raised in the defence, the judge said: ""I find that Prenor acted with due diligence and without negligence in the exercise of its obligation to the mortgagor and the guarantors to obtain reasonable price on resale. Prenor listed the property with credible real estate agents, changed agents when their efforts were not successful, and also acted independently to market the property during the listings. It had no conflicting interest to retain the property in its possession, and the sale to the third party was at arm's length. Prenor consulted frequently with others, including its real estate agents, to determine proper listing price and there is simply no credible evidence that the resale price was not reasonable market price."" However, the judge held that the application could not succeed because the order of October 17, 1991 extending the time was not one which the prothonotary had power to give. This was an irregularity, but it was not one that the court was prepared, in the circumstances, to cure. See Civil Procedure Rule 2.01 and 3.03. As to the amount of the claim, the judge said: ""I advised the parties that would accept Prenor's statement of deficiency in the amount of $186,386 unless any of the amounts therein were successfully challenged by the guarantor, Mr. Bezanson. do not find that any of them have been successfully challenged."" In the result, the application was dismissed with costs to the respondent. It is not disputed that the prothonotary did not have jurisdiction to grant the order of October 17, 1991 purporting to extend the time within which an application for a deficiency judgment could be made. However, I am of the view that the order made on May 19, 1992 conclusively resolved the issue of the timeliness of Prenor\'s application for a deficiency judgment. This was an order ""otherwise"" within the meaning of Civil Procedure Rule 41.10(3). It was consented to by the respondents' solicitor. I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the chambers judge and give judgment to Prenor against the respondent and the other two defendants for $186,386, together with interest at 6% from August 14, 1992, costs on the chambers application of $1,500 plus disbursements and costs of this appeal of $600 plus disbursements.

584,"Facts:[2] During the construction of Dr. Paul Joseph’s (“Joseph”) home by Paul Jollymore (“Jollymore”) and his company Maritime Project Management Inc. (“Maritime”), Jollymore contracted for a certain amount of flooring material from the Appellant (“Wacky’s”) for use in the home of Joseph.
[3] Some of this flooring material had been selected by Joseph and his wife when they visited the Wacky’s store with Jollymore.
There was, however, no direct contact between Wacky’s and Joseph or his wife, and the purchasing of all material was left up to Jollymore who dealt with Wacky’s flooring manager.
The goods were invoiced to Maritime and delivered and installed in the Joseph’s home.
[4] Cheques to pay for the construction process and the services of subcontractors were provided by Joseph primarily to Jollymore, but also to others on Jollymore’s instructions.
Other cheques and cash were paid out to various parties and a total amount of approximately $638,600.00 were paid out by Joseph under the direction of Jollymore.
Jollimore and Maritime declared bankruptcy and failed to complete their obligations under the oral contract with the Josephs.
However, the flooring remained in the Joseph’s home, yet Wacky’s has not received compensation for the flooring.
[7] Wacky’s commenced proceedings against Maritime, Jollymore and Joseph.","The 46-year-old male plaintiff suffered damage to his knee, left ear and exacerbation of a back problem when his vehicle was struck by the defendant's vehicle.

No. 93-6240 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA BETWEEN: LLOYD GIBBS, Plaintiff ‑and- CHERYL ARCHIBALD, Defendant DECISION HEARD: at Halifax, Nova Scotia before The Honourable Justice Walter E. Goodfellow on January 9, 10 and 11, 1995 Final medical report tendered by consent February 11, 1995 DECISION: February 22, 1995 COUNSEL: Ronald B. Mitton, Solicitor for the Plaintiff R. Malcolm MacLeod, Solicitor for the Defendant and Alain Begin, Articled Clerk GOODFELLOW. BACKGROUND Lloyd Gibbs, on Saturday, May 30, 1992 operated his motor vehicle west on Greenfield Road and stopped at the then stop line at 'T' intersection with Lower Harmony Road. His evidence is that he looked both ways and then entered Lower Harmony Road travelling south and saw motor vehicle, operated by Cheryl Archibald, travelling north on Old Harmony Road as she crested hill and came into view at point which measures approximately 125 meters from Greenfield Road. His first recollection of observing her was when he says he was completely established on the right side of the road in his own lane. Cheryl Archibald left her home shortly before the time of the accident. She was travelling north on Lower Harmony Road when she crested the hill at the approximately 125 meter mark from the Greenfield Road. She was travelling to pick up bridesmaid in preparation for attendance at wedding at p.m. Her evidence is that immediately after she crested the hill, she found the Gibs van facing her. She was not sure where it had come from, but that it was in her lane, and she thought it must be pulling off to driveway across her path and it still had its left signal light flashing. Ms. Archibald states that she took evasive action to try and go around the Gibs vehicle to her left when she says the Gibs vehicle moved into its lane. She slammed her brakes and tried to move back into her own lane, and the side, front driver's side of the Gibs motor vehicle and her front driver's side came into contact so that she was thrown sideways and the van ended up tipped over. Both motor vehicle operators were alone and wearing seat belts. Ms. Archibald suffered broken ankle necessitating surgery and the insertion of pins, and she has separate action outstanding in relation to her injuries. Mr. Gibbs was taken by ambulance to hospital, and medical evidence indicates he suffered a concussion, hearing loss in his left ear, neck injury, injury to his lower back and injury to his knee which hit the dashboard. There is agreement that it was beautiful day and the accident occurred at approximately a.m. with no interference in visibility, clear, bright, sunny day with no precipitation. 2. MOTOR VEHICLE ACT s. 100(1): ""Duty to drive carefully 100 (1) Every person driving or operating motor vehicle on highway or any place ordinarily accessible to the public shall drive or operate the same in careful and prudent manner having regard to all the circumstances."" s.101: ""Careful and prudent speed 101 person operating or driving vehicle on highway shall operate or drive the same at careful and prudent rate of speed not greater than is reasonable and proper, having due regard to the traffic, surface and width of the highway and of all other conditions at the time existing, and person shall not operate or drive vehicle upon highway at such speed or in such manner as to endanger the life, limb or property of any person."" s. 106(1): ""General maximum speed 106 (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, but subject to subsection (2) and Section 109, no person shall drive motor vehicle at speed in excess of eighty kilometres per hour on any highway at any time."" s. 110(1): ""Duty to drive on right 110 (1) Upon all highways of sufficient width, except upon one‑way streets, the operator or driver of vehicle shall operate or drive the same upon the right half of the highway and shall drive slow‑moving vehicle as closely as possible to the right‑hand edge or curb of such highway, unless it is impracticable to travel on such side of the highway except when overtaking and passing another vehicle subject to the rules applicable in overtaking and passing set forth in Section 115."" s. 118(1)(b): ""Rules respecting intersection 118 (1) Wherever practicable the driver of vehicle intending to turn at an intersection shall do so as follows: (b) approach for left turn shall be made in the lane for traffic to the right of and nearest to the centre line of the highway and the left turn shall be made by passing to the right of the centre line where it enters the intersection, and upon leaving the intersection by passing to the right of the centre line of the highway then entered and when practicable by making the left turn in the portion of the intersection to the left of the centre of the intersection;"" (1) Evidence Findings (a) Lloyd Gibbs Mr. Gibbs is a 46 year old married man. He and his wife have one child, 16 year old daughter who is mentally challenged and presently resides at the Nova Scotia Youth Training Centre. Mr. Gibbs is university graduate with some leadership ability who now occupies the position of Manager Petroleum Gas Fuel Licences for the Province of Nova Scotia in the Department of the Environment. He has, since the accident successfully been elected member of his local school board, and has made considerable public commitment in leadership position struggling to retain the Nova Scotia Youth Training Centre. Overall he impressed me as steady, conscientious person of integrity whose evidence found credible. Mr. Gibbs relates coming to stop at the Greenfield Road and then in the normal way proceeding to turn left. He became completely established on the right side of the Lower Harmony Road travelling south when he saw car crest the top of the hill, after which he noticed it begin to come left of centre to his side of the road and that this happened rather quickly. The Archibald vehicle came completely over into his side of the road, and he says they were facing directly head on. At the last second he whipped the wheel of his van to the right to try and avoid her, but was unable to do so, resulting in an impact head on and more to the left front of his van. He was apparently rendered unconscious and suffered injuries which will review in detail when address the matter of damages. (b) Cheryl Archibald Cheryl Archibald is an intelligent person with responsible position as credit advisor with the Farmer's Credit Corporation, and while do not question her integrity, her credibility in terms of accurate recall of her speed, attentions, distance and response, is questionable. In her evidence she stated that immediately as she crested the hill, she saw the van facing her, and she was not sure at that point where it came from. She assumed it must be pulling off to driveway, and she immediately decided to go around it. It is at this point she says the Gibbs van started to go across into its correct lane, and she slammed on her brakes and tried to move back into her own lane but skidded and came in collision with the Gibbs van. An important finding for the court to make is the point of impact between the two vehicles and Ms. Archibald says it occurred ""side, front driver's side front and my front driver's side"". She stated her speed was in the mid 70's, 75 to 80 and she gave somewhat of shrug when giving this evidence. Clearly she is guessing. She resorts to the almost time honoured exercise of indicating that she always travelled that stretch of road within the speed limit of 80 km/h and draws the conclusion that she was probably travelling within the speed limit on this occasion. She is very familiar with the area of the accident, and travelled it with frequency when she went to the Agricultural College in Truro, and in the past three years prior to the accident when she was in Prince Edward Island, she was home every second weekend and travelled the road with continual frequency. She was going to pick up friend to attend her best friend's wedding. She acknowledged that she did not see the Gibbs motor vehicle coming out of the intersection so that when she crested the hill, she is acknowledging that the Gibbs motor vehicle had already completed its turn into Lower Harmony Road and was proceeding southward, although with its left signal light still functioning. The distance from when she first observed the Gibbs van is 125 to 128 meters. She explains that there was some confusion in her mind as to what the Gibbs van was doing, and she thought it might be turning into laneway on her right hand side. This confusion arose at the instance of observation, and if she was going at the reduced speed she indicates, below the speed limit, reduced by her removal of her foot from the gas peddle, then it's extremely difficult to understand why she did not brake to control her vehicle unless, of course, she did not keep proper lookout and only observed the Gibbs motor vehicle at the last moment or more likely did not have anywhere near the amount of time that she says existed due to much higher rate of speed than she realized. Ms. Archibald gave statements, and her explanation as to the difference in her earlier statements with respect to speed is that they were given when she was on medication, however, the accident was May 30, 1992 and her statements were given June 10th and 11th, 1992. The surgery on her ankle was performed on May 30th or June 1st and she was released from hospital at that time. The statement in her own writing, June 11, 1992 says: was travelling at about 70 km/hr. along straight stretch and then began to slow down before the crest. always do this because know the area, and just beyond the crest you have the Greenfield Road on the right. When crested the hill, would say had slowed down to about 60 km/h. At that instant saw van facing me on my side of the road. assumed he had come from the Greenfield Road, and his left blinker was on. hit the brake, didn't know what he was planning on doing, so began to veer to the left."" She went on to relate, in that statement, that the collision was left front to left front. In the statement given the 10th of June, 1992 she said: went about or miles and you are on straight stretch and then you crest small hill. Roughly 300 feet from the top of the hill is the Greenfield Road. This is intersection with the road was on. was travelling roughly 60 or 70 km per hour on the top of the hill because had slowed because know this is bad intersection. had been doing roughly 70 to 80km/h before the top of the hill. When came over the hill remember seeing the front of the van and his blinker on. He was on my side of the road. thought he might be pulling into the side of the road on my side. really wasn't sure what he was doing so went left. also hit my brakes."" (c) Alan C. Golding Mr. Golding is the Director of Traffic Engineering for the Department of Transportation, and his letter of June 15, 1993 was entered by consent. The Department of Transportation conducted an investigation in late May, 1993 and made certain recommendations and conclusions, including: ""3) Crossing sight distance measurements indicate that approximately seconds is required for vehicle to move from the stop location on the Greenfield Road approach to position fully occupying the correct (right hand) lane on the Lower Harmony leg of the intersection. Based on the prevailing speed limit of 80 km/h, an approaching vehicle would have approximately 5.6 seconds to react to vehicle entering the road; in effect, the crossing sight distance is more than adequate for the left turn manoeuvre from the Greenfield Road to the Lower Harmony leg of the intersection ..."" (d) Avard Palmer Mr. Palmer is an experienced auto body repair person, and he purchased the Gibbs van for $2,300 in August, 1992. He noted the damage to the vehicle as shown in photographs taken at the salvage yard, and indicated the left hand skirt was damaged and shoved into the right and that it appeared to him the force was through the wheel. He described what was necessary to replace and repair the motor vehicle for its subsequent sale by him or weeks later. He acknowledged there was damage to the left front assembly light of the Gibbs van and to the hood. (e) Sgt. Geoffrey M. Tucker, R.C.M.P. Each side called an expert, both of whom possessed their own particular strengths. Mr. Gibbs called Sgt. Geoffrey Tucker of the R.C.M.P. who was qualified as an accident reconstructionist. He has taken the highest level courses available to R.C.M.P. officers in this field, and is member of the National Association to which accident reconstructionists belong. He has extremely wide experience with respect to the practical side of accidents in his many years of police service, predominantly in the highway traffic field. Overall, his approach to the reconstruction was done conservatively. His analysis based upon reviewing all of the police file, photographs, attending at the scene with the investigative Cst. and Mr. Gibbs, etc. included some experimentation on site particularly in relation to the angle at which the Gibbs van might be at the point of impact. He reviewed in detail, and his report is part of the record, various factors that are examined in accident reconstruction including the accident location, impact point, extent of damage to both vehicles, location of damage, final resting place of the vehicle, topography, particularly the unobstructed view, measurement and location of the skid marks and the direction, etc. f) Professor J. David Innis was impressed with the qualifications and professionalism of Professor Innis, who is also member of the National Association. He had certain material, including the discovery transcripts, not resorted to by Sgt. Tucker. On the other hand, he did not conduct any on‑site simulations or experiments. accept Professor Innis' advice that the drag slide to stop test conducted by Sgt. Tucker would not give you an accurate estimate as to the speed at the time of impact by taking straight mathematical deduction from the estimated speed. Sgt Tucker used the drag sled test to determine, in Sgt. Tucker's view, that if Ms. Archibald was going at the speed she indicated, he concluded the speed at impact would not cause anywhere near the extent of damage, and in his calculations Sgt. Tucker, as Professor Innis pointed out, used drag sled to stop test. You cannot use this test and simply deduct the speed at impact from the estimated speed as calculated by Sgt. Tucker. Professor Innis indicates substantial angle must have existed at the point of impact based upon his examination and interpretation of the material made available, including the photographs, and he concludes that the point of impact was on the left front wheel of the van consistent with substantial angle. In simple terms he draws the conclusion that at that angle, Mr. Gibbs must have been coming from Ms. Archibald's side of the road at the point of impact. He says this confirmed by the van's final location. He also draws conclusions that support the speed estimate advanced by Ms. Archibald, and he draws strength from Mr. Gibbs' statement that he had travelled up the hill and observed, for the first time, the Archibald vehicle at point which would not be consistent with theft combined speeds. Quite possibly Mr. Gibbs is out slightly in his conclusion as to when he first observed the Archibald motor vehicle, and it probably was at point closer to the completion of his turn. Nevertheless conclude that Gibbs, at the time of impact and immediately prior was travelling entirely within the south lane of the Lower Harmony Road, and just prior to impact sharply turned his wheel to the right in forlorn attempt to avoid the oncoming Archibald vehicle. Professor Innis noted the ""Lower Harmony Road at the intersection is quite curved. In fact, the radius of the horizontal curve is in the order of 200 meters."" The diagram provided shows that from the crest of the hill Ms. Archibald would be entering curve which is more pronounced at the intersection, but nevertheless she would likely have followed the natural tendency of going into the curve close to the centre line. The evidence of the parties is significant in respect to their view as to the point of impact, and it is much more of head‑on feature than is accounted for by Professor Innis and my conclusion on the physical evidence. Discovery evidence of Ms. Archibald tendered shows that when asked, ""what part of the van did you hit?"" she responded, ""A. Driver's side front corner."" ""Q. Would you describe this as head‑on collision or how would you describe it? A. My, not direct, umm ... it depends on how you describe head‑on. A. Like full full force, no, it was my corn ... front driver corner and his .... Q. Yeh, your your your front driver's corner .... A. Yes. Q. And his front driver's corner. Q. So short of a, umm ... half half way over sort of thing. Yes."" This is consistent with her evidence before me, and accept and prefer the evidence of Sgt. Tucker with respect to the interpretation to be placed upon the physical damage to the vehicles. Professor Innis put his weight substantially on photographs of the vehicles at the salvage yard, and there has been some appreciable change in the Archibald vehicle, particularly in the location of the front bumper which, quite probably incurred through its being towed to the salvage yard. In any event Sgt. Tucker pointed out that the left front tire of the van appears to be undamaged other than what appears to be one or two scrapes which may or may not have occurred in the accident, and there is almost no perceptible or identifiable damage to the rim or chrome hub cap. Sgt. Tucker was able to advise that on previous occasion. he accidentally dropped chrome hub cap similar to the one on the Archibald vehicle from waist‑high position and it shattered. It is inconceivable that the chrome hub cap would not have shown some signs of damage if the point of impact had been as suggested by Professor Innis. Nevertheless, all the photographs consistently show no damage to the chrome hub cap or wheel. Professor Innis' explanation that circular damage on the Archibald vehicle is where the Gibbs' van left front wheel stuck is not accepted. prefer the evidence of Sgt. Tucker, and my own assessment is that when the Archibald vehicle had its brakes locked and came into impact, it would have had the weight bringing the front end of the Archibald vehicle down, making it far less likely that the damage could be anywhere near as high as the impact point suggested by Professor Innis. With respect to the effect upon the van, there would have been, as Sgt. Tucker indicated, lifting force particularly given the higher relative speed of the Archibald vehicle. conclude that the point of impact was far more probable at the front of both vehicles. Such conclusion changes the angle upon which much of Professor Innis' conclusions are based. In addition the lifting effect gives some explanation to the final resting position of the van on its side, and my conclusion is reinforced by the practical simulations of Sgt. Tucker. Sgt. Tucker acknowledges that if Professor Innis' angle conclusion was accurate, it would have meant that Mr. Gibbs would have started his turn shortly before impact out of Ms. Archibald's lane, however, am satisfied from the evidence of Mr. Gibbs that he in fact was entirely within his own lane at the time of impact, and had been there from shortly after cutting, to at least the normal extent, the corner from the Greenfield Road into the southbound lane of the Lower Harmony Road. There is complete agreement that the point of impact between the vehicles is well within the southbound lane. consider that Sgt. Tucker, with his vast experience of attending at actual accident scenes, has given much preferred and more probable conclusion of the impact point on the vehicles from the inspection of the actual damage, and that his conclusion is consistent with the evidence of parties. On the balance of probabilities find that the impact occurred not only in Mr. Gibbs' southbound lane, but left front to left front, and that given the time available to her, Ms. Archibald was not driving at prudent rate of speed nor maintaining prudent lookout so that after cresting the hill, she ought to, in these circumstances, have been able to control her vehicle by driving at more prudent rate of speed and slowing down on visually sighting the Gibbs motor vehicle. Ms. Archibald was not justified entering the opposing lane of traffic solely because the Gibbs motor vehicle's left‑hand turn signal was still flashing when she first observed it in close proximity to the intersection. Ms. Archibald, on cresting the hill, had between 125 and 128 meters to the extension of the Greenfield Road at the intersection, and approximately 103 to 106 meters to the point of collision. Professor Innis indicated that the present design standard for sight distance to an intersection is 140 meters. Ms. Archibald was familiar with the limitations of sight caused by the hill, which are dramatically shown in the photographs, and there is further acknowledgment of the limitation of sight distance approaching the crest of the hill and she said ""I was travelling at about 70 km/hr along the straight stretch, and then began to slow down before the crest. always do so because know the area and just beyond the crest you have the Greenfield Road on the right"". Any driver approaching blind crest, such as this, must exercise reasonable, prudent level of care, and while Ms. Archibald may well have exercised such on past occasions, conclude that she failed to do so on May 30, 1992. Had she driven in prudent manner, she could have carried on at reduced speed in her own lane without coming in contact with the Gibbs motor vehicle. Conclusion: The onus is upon Mr. Gibbs to establish negligence on the part of Ms. Archibald and on the balance of probabilities he has fully met that onus. I conclude that Ms. Archibald's inattention, coupled with a probable higher rate of speed than she estimates, renders her solely responsible for this accident, and she was not justified in entering the lane of opposing traffic. am unable to conclude any contributory negligence on the part of Mr. Gibbs. DAMAGES Pre‑Accident Health Lloyd Gibbs born March 26, 1948 was 44 at the time of this accident and he is now 46. His family physician, Dr. Roger H. Cook, reported November 11, 1993: ""Mr. Gibbs back problems did not begin with the motor vehicle accident. Prior to the accident he had history of episodes of low back pain about once per year. They typically lasted three or four days with each flare‑up and were not associated with feeling of spasm. There was never any radiation of pain with these episodes."" Mr. Gibbs had no neck or left knee complaints prior to this accident. In 1988 Dr. Cook referred Mr. Gibbs to Dr. Keith Walling, an ear specialist, who reported March 11, 1988: ""Many thanks for referring this gentleman who was found to have some abnormality in his left ear. As far as his ears are concerned, he is asymptomatic."" Dr. Walling's examination in 1988 made reference to mild tonsillitis, but there was nothing of significance found with respect to his ears. Post this accident Mr. Gibbs has had problems with his neck, left knee and exacerbation of his lumbar pain and hearing loss in his left ear. His recovery has been interfered with and delayed due to his undergoing coronary by‑pass surgery in April, 1993, however, Dr. R.W. Landymore reported October 1, 1993: ""Although it is possible that the trauma resulting from this accident may have aggravated his coronary symptoms and/or precipitated the heart attack, the underlying coronary artery disease was, undoubtedly, present for some years preceding the motor vehicle accident."" Medical Evidence Dr. Roger H. Cook, Family Physician 1. Report dated June 29, 1992 Mr. Gibbs' complaints on June 1, 1992 were of dizziness and stiff sore neck. Neck x‑rays disclose no abnormalities. Dr. Cook next saw Mr. Gibbs June 5th and his complaints were dizziness, headaches and sore neck. Dr. Cook reported: 'There was no tenderness on examination of his neck but he did have moderately limited range of motion particularly on moving his head to the right."" His neck remained quite painful particularly this time on lateral flexion to the left. He was having difficulty sleeping due to the pain in spite of the use of soft collar. He was started on medication, Imipramine, to try to relieve the pain and improve his sleep. As of the 17th of June there was no change in his neck pain."" ""At this point my working diagnosis with Mr. Gibbs is of concussion and muscular and/or ligamentous neck injury."" ""I would anticipate that his problems will resolve completely, probably within the next few months but obviously such an estimate is very rough."" 2. Report October 26, 1992 Dr. Cook commented: ""I saw him on the 23rd of September 1992 at which time he complained of pain and grinding in his left knee."" ""He had an x‑ray of his left knee which was reported as normal. When saw him next on the 29th of December he described somewhat different sensation, more of burning numbness over the knee and he felt that there was point in which he could press which would exacerbate this discomfort. Neither he nor were able to demonstrate the trigger point in the office. At the moment am suspicious that he had minor nerve injury perhaps resulting in neuroma which is benign growth at the end of the severed nerve and which is responsible for the pain."" 3. Report of November 11, 1993 Dr. Cook commented: ""Mr. Gibbs most recent visits with me were October 20, 1993 and November 2, 1993."" “1) Neck Mr. Gibbs continues to have pain in his neck severe enough that it sometimes wakes him through the night."" ""On examination he has normal range of flexion with mild discomfort. He has about 80% of normal extension during which he complains of grinding and pain in the center of his neck. Rotation to either side is about 75% normal range again with grinding and pain? ""An x‑ray of the cervical spine in May of 1992 was reported as showing significant disc space narrowing at the C5‑6 level and osteoarthritis at that same level."" “2) Left Knee ... Sitting and walking are not uncomfortable except for the continued numbness. On examination there was an inconsistent decrease in pinprick sensation over small area around the lower outer edge of the kneecap. He has normal strength in the knee and about 95% of normal flexion of the knee with puffing and burning sensation described by the patient with attempt at full flexion. There are no palpable nodules and was not able to identify any trigger point. An x‑ray of the left knee September 25, 1992 is reported as showing no bony or soft tissue abnormality other than slight deformity of the proximal left fibula suggesting an old fracture."" “3) Low back ... Since the motor vehicle accident he has had three episodes of severe back pain, the first lasted two weeks, the second two or three weeks, and the third now about weeks duration and continues. There is no radiation of his pain. The flare‑ups of pain since the motor vehicle accident have been more severe than those prior to the accident. At present he has pain with sitting for more than about 15 minutes. He has to shift position in order to relieve the pain. On examination there was tenderness over the high left lumbar paraspinal muscles. He had normal range of flexion in that he was able to reach his toes. Extension of his low back was limited to about 1/2 of normal range due to pain at the upper lumbar level. There was no radiation of this pain. He has normal lateral flexion but with pain and normal rotation with mild discomfort. His reflexes in lower limbs are normal. Straight leg raising on each side is to 90 degrees with no pain. An x‑ray of his lumbosacral spine is reported as showing narrowing of the L4‑5 and L5‑S1 disc spaces consistent with degenerative disc disease and osteophytic spurring particularly at the L5 and Sl levels indicative of osteoarthritis."" ""In summary, believe that Mr. Gibbs has experienced significant exacerbation of pre‑existing problem with osteoarthritis and degenerative disc disease at the lumbar and cervical level as result of his motor vehicle accident. The problem with his knee also appears to be directly the result of the accident. suspect that the cause here is neuroma as described in my previous letter to you."" Dr. Keith Walling, Ear Specialist 1. Report July 6, 1992 Dr. Walling reports: ""he has been extremely dizzy although recently this has settled down much more. His wife has, since the motor vehicle accident, been complaining that he has the TV up rather loudly. He does not suffer any tinnitus. He does not have any history of hunting or other noise damage in the past."" ""Neurologically, could not find any abnormality and audiologically he has moderate to severe high frequency sensorineural loss in the left ear,"" This gentleman is suffering from post concusional vertigo. He seems to be making very rapid recovery. It would seem that concurrent with this, he has suffered some damage to his hearing."" 2. Report of August 26, 1992 Dr. Walling reports: saw him initially in 1988, at which time his ears were normal apart from slight degree of retraction on the left side."" Following this injury, he was extremely dizzy but, when saw him week after the accident, he was already beginning to get over the dizziness but it was noted by his wife and by himself, that he had some hearing loss. did an audiogram on him on July 6th, copy attached. As you can see from this, he has high frequency left sided sensorineural loss. He did not give any history in either examination of noise exposure and, in 1988, he did not have any subjective hearing loss symptoms. As this gentleman experienced hearing loss following the injury and suffered from vertigo and the hearing loss was also noted by his wife following the injury, should be as certain as can be that he suffered from post concussional vertigo, along with concussion to his inner ear and would say that his hearing loss is likely to be permanent in the left ear."" 3. Report of November 2, 1992 Dr. Walling reported: ""Repeat audiometric studies show his hearing loss to be exactly what it was when saw him in July and would think therefore that the level of hearing that he has at the moment, is going to be permanent."" 4. Report of December 12, 1994 Dr. Walling reported: ""... am not aware of any other possible cause for this gentleman's high frequency predominantly left sided sensory neural hearing loss other than his MVA and head injury after which all of his current symptoms arose."" Dr. Michael Gross, Orthopaedic Surgeon 1. Report September 18, 1992 Dr. Gross reported that Mr. Gibbs was aware he had pain in his left knee from hitting the dashboard, and he went on to report: ""SYMPTOMS ARISING FROM THE ACCIDENT: Neck Pain: The neck pain started on the day of the accident. It became worse over the next two to three days. He was treated with collar which he wore for three weeks. He now finds that the neck pain is episodic. It never actually goes away, but varies in severity. The neck pain makes his head feel very heavy. He cannot stay in one position for long and supports his head while watching T.V. He has dull heavy pain when he sits in one spot for prolonged periods of time. The patient has received physiotherapy for this complaint, which has resulted in the relief of pain for two to three days. Vertigo: The patient has been subject to attacks of severe dizziness. He has fallen down couple of times as result of this and noticed that the vertigo is associated with nausea. These attacks lasted for one and half months. They slowly improved after that and they have now disappeared. He was seen and assessed by Dr. Walling for these complaints. Hearing: The patient notes that he uses his left hand to his ear to enhance his hearing ability. His T.V. is turned up in volume to the point where his wife objects. He has found it difficult in general to hear as well since his accident."" Dr. Gross also reports: ""The patient admits to having had back pain in the past. It has been localized over his lower lumbar spine. He, in the past has been immobilized with the pain and has been taken by ambulance to hospital. The lower back pain is still bit of problem and depends on whether he strains, has big meals or is under lot of stress."" Dr. Gross noted Mr. Gibbs' concerns with respect to difficulties with sleeping for which he takes medication and that he is unable to cut wood or landscape and found it difficult to clear snow. Dr. Gross' examination indicated reduced rotation of his cervical spine, pain in the right shoulder, decreased sensation on the back of his right hand, however his lumbar spine exhibited full range of motion. It was noted that his left knee demonstrated decreased sensation. Dr. Gross reviewed x‑rays and the CT scan noted cervical spine revealed degenerative disk disease at C5‑6, and Dr. Gross concluded Mr. Gibbs suffered severe injury to the soft tissues of the cervical spine with pre‑existing degenerative disease being exacerbated. Fortunately, the vertigo had abated. Dr. Gross' prognosis was that it would likely take one to two years before Mr. Gibbs' neck complaints settled down. That he will likely have residue neck stiffness, neck pain which will be exacerbated by any form of heavy activity or exertional activity and this exacerbation may come about by weather changes or with prolonged sitting in one position. 2. Report January 30, 1995 Dr. Gross reported: 'There is no sign of specific nerve root irritation in either his cervical spine or his lumbar spine, and this would seem to indicate that his back pain has been caused by post traumatic exacerbation of his disc degeneration but hasn't progressed to irritate nerve at the present time. The natural history of such back and neck pain is for symptoms to decrease in severity with the passage of time; that time being 2‑5 years on average. Surgical intervention in these cases has not met with the resounding success, and therefore is unlikely to be recommended for this individual. There is no sign of serious instability in the lumbar spine that would be one of the major indications for surgery when there is no evidence of nerve root involvement. The patient will likely therefore to (sic) continue to suffer episodes of back pain, but as he accepts and adapts to his back pain he find (sic) that with the passage of time he is able to do little more in the way of exercise which would be walking or swimming. He is unlikely to get back into full exercise regime such as chopping and splitting wood, looking after dogs, etc; activities which he previously enjoyed. The patient's knee injury has left him with some confusion or bruising of the nerve but not complete section of the nerve. This (sic) symptoms may improve with time, as the nerve regenerates, but do not think that this is major disability and has not resulted in any major arthritic degeneration in the knee. He is able to compensate for these symptoms to limited degree by using kneeling pad, but direct irritation of the area continues to upset him and give him pain. Again think these knee symptoms will slowly resolve with the passage of time, but over the next 2‑5 years he is not going to be able to return to his previous level of physical activity. Mr. Gibs complaints and prognosis with respect to his hearing loss has been extremely well covered by Dr. Walling."" 5. HEARING ASSESSMENT Mr. Gibbs indicated and accept he had no hearing limitations prior to this accident. Dr. Walling's evidence clearly establishes Mr. Gibbs suffered high frequency left sided sensorineural loss which is likely to be permanent. The degree of impairment is described by Dr. Walling as ""the degree of loss that he has will give him moderate degree of permanent deafness particularly in situations with background noise or in group conversation"". The opinion of Dr. Walling is consistent with Mr. Gibbs' evidence that it is not total loss of hearing but partial which Mr. Gibbs went on to describe as ""more aggravation as hear dull sounds, irritable"". The first complaint was by his wife that he had the T.V. on too loud and Mr. Gibbs had trouble with background noise such as dishes in the kitchen, or at meeting. He might face some strain and some ""pardon me's"". There is no indication that he has lost total hearing or that the hearing impairment interferes with his substantial distance driving of motor vehicle et cetera. The loss he has is permanent and the major difficulty have in assessing damages at an appropriate level is that do not have any evidence of the degree of impairment or yard stick which would make comparison principally with other cases somewhat more reliable. In this case initially Dr. Walling mentioned he did not suffer tinnitis (Report August 26/92) but subsequently complained of it on October 21st, 1992 (Walling Report, November 2/92). Although Dr. Walling noted ""this apparently is not too bad but he did not notice this before"". Mr. Gibbs did mention some difficulties with balance. Dr. Walling did not mention tinnitis in his final report (December 12/94) nor did Mr. Gibbs in his evidence. Care must always be exercised in utilizing awards in other cases as obviously no two injury situations nor the impact of similar injuries are likely to be identical. The cases referred to are of little comparison as they indicate global awards or specific factual loss i.e. 60% of hearing in one ear et cetera. Tims‑Loveless v. Novotony (1991), 1991 CanLII 4318 (NS SC), 110 N.S.R. 2d 85 cited by Mr. Gibbs' counsel is of very minimal assistance. Mrs. Tims had pre‑existing hearing problem and consented to surgery with the unfortunate result she suffered total hearing loss in her left ear. The decision does not mention her age or overall degree of impairment prior to surgery, although it does indicate her hearing was deteriorating and at sometime in the future she would likely reach very severe hearing disability in any event. Justice Richard assessed damages at $15,000.00 however it was global assessment covering loss of amenities, inconvenience, pain and suffering, and loss of sick leave. The loss itself was incurred by her in 1984. I conclude in this case a reasonable award for the permanent hearing impairment suffered by Mr. Gibbs which will continue to be a source of concern, irritation and aggravation but where there is no evidence that it will lead to a total loss of hearing in his left ear or any acceleration of further loss of hearing in the left ear is the amount of $8,500.00. LEFT KNEE Mr. Gibbs indicated that his knee impacted the dash resulting in small cut and he experienced searing pain as if he had been cut with knife. He experienced some grinding and said that he had learned to live with the knee and expected he might have to have surgical removal of some scar tissue. Mr. Gibbs had no problem with his knee prior to the accident and it has neither improved or deteriorated. Mr. Gibbs was telling it the way it is and was not exaggerating and he should be compensated for the past, present and future pain and aggravation he will sporadically incur. It is to be noted however that Dr. Cook in his final report indicated Mr. Gibbs has normal strength in the knee and about 95% of normal flexion. Dr. Gross felt the symptoms may improve with time as the nerve regenerates and he did not classify this as major disability nor has it resulted in any major arthritic degeneration in the knee. Dr. Gross felt the knee symptoms will slowly resolve over the next two to five years. He was not going to be able to return to his previous level of physical activity. For past, present, and future limited pain suffering inconvenience interference with the amenities previously enjoyed by Mr. Gibbs I assess damages at $2,500.00. 7. NECK LOWER BACK Dr. Cook in his final report of April 11/93 found normal range of flexion with mild discomfort and about 80% of normal extension with rotation to either side at about 75% of normal range but with grinding and pain. It is clear therefore that Mr. Gibbs has only limited restriction of neck movement. Such movement brings forth pain. Dr. Cook put the pre‑existing back problem in proper perspective when he considered the accident to be significant exacerbation of pre‑existing problem with osteoarthritis and degenerative disk disease at the lumbar and cervical level. Dr. Gross the orthopaedic surgeon found no sign of specific nerve root irritation in either his cervical spine or his lumbar spine and he expressed the views that the natural history of such back and neck pain is for symptoms to decrease in severity with the passage of time. Dr. Gross in his final report indicated that overall Mr. Gibbs' complaints had not improved and would likely continue. However, he felt that there was less than 10% chance of surgical intervention being required for his neck and back complaints. Dr. Gross also noted that the accident interfered with Mr. Gibbs having proper exercise regime following his cardiac surgery. Mr. Gibbs pointed out that he does lot of driving and while it has been reduced somewhat it is clear that he is coping as he drives considerable distance on an annual basis in his employment. He wore cervical collar initially for about three weeks, and overall he expressed the view that he cannot honestly say that his neck has gotten any better. He also notices frequent flare ups with respect to his back whereas they were sporadic before the accident. He missed some time from employment but there is no loss of income claim advanced. His day to day routine prior to the accident was one of fairly active outdoor individual. He often split his own wood, looked after his lawn, snow removal, wallpapering, painting, whipper snipping, and many of these activities are limited or beyond his present capacity. He and his wife used to have Irish Setters and have had as many as thirteen dogs which required great deal of work in cleaning, grooming, exercising, travel et cetera, and he has had to give up this great pleasure, and he and his wife are now down to one dog. He had been dog breeder since 1970 and was member of the Cobequid Dog Club. It was major hobby and love of his. He used to go fishing half dozen to ten times year and this is no longer possible. He indicated he did lot of swimming and other activities with his mentally challenged daughter and said that this was pretty well curtailed, however, it is pleasing to note Dr. Gross' final report indicates that with the passage of time he will be able to do little more in the way of exercise which would be walking or swimming, and post this accident he has put swimming pool in his backyard. am optimistic that he will be able to do some of the things he did prior to the accident but not those involving any heavy lifting, such as snow shovelling, most activities relating to dog raising et cetera. have already commented that on discovery he indicated travel in the range of 60,000 to 70,000 kilometres per year which at trial he thought might be little on the high side and it might be as low as 40,000 to 50,000 kilometres which nevertheless shows considerable capacity on the part of Mr. Gibbs to live with his difficulties. He utilizes no seat or cushion for driving purposes. He had quadruple heart by‑pass but experiences no difficulties or problems now. However, it is noted he carries an excessive amount of weight. He put in wooden deck around the pool after the accident but the work was done predominantly by his father. He goes to dog shows now, but more in the nature of social outing. To his credit Mr. Gibbs has been involved publically in leadership capacity with respect to the possible retention of the Nova Scotia Youth Training Centre and he is also post the accident been elected to the local School Board. Overall was impressed with Mr. Gibbs as one who will make every effort to overcome and compensate for the continuing significant difficulties he suffers as result of this accident. We have therefore, situation where Mr. Gibbs has suffered cervical injury which has not been labelled mild, moderate, severe, or one, two or three. However, the pain and suffering that he has endured to date, and will sporadically continue to endure, coupled with the interference with his lifestyle and loss of amenities brings this whiplash injury close to severe designation when it comes to the range of damages referred to by our Court of Appeal: ""In Smith Stubbert (1992), 1992 CanLII 2554 (NS CA), 117 N.S.R. (2d) 118 considerable guidance was given to the trial justices by Chipman, J.A. at page 127: ""I have considered number of recent cases involving damage awards for injuries not unlike those sustained by the respondent. Most are cases dealing with that small percentage of people who do not recover from soft tissue injuries of the neck but suffer long‑term discomfort which almost invariably brings on emotional problems. Some of the cases dealt with other injuries in addition, and others dealt with injuries of different nature but having the common feature of long‑term chronic pain. No two cases are alike and even similar injuries will impact differently on different people. In the cases reviewed, the symptoms persisted and usually many doctors were involved in the treatment and/or assessment of the injuries. Each case was decided by different court at different time and precise range of awards cannot, with precision, be laid down. In broad terms the range for nonpecuniary damage awards for such persistently troubling but not totally disabling injury is from $18,000 to $40,000."" ""Chipman, J.A. also added: In dealing with nonpecuniary awards it is useful to keep in mind what Dickson, J. speaking for the Supreme Court of Canada said in Andrews v. Grand and Toy (Alberta) Ltd., 1978 CanLII (SCC), [1978] S.C.R. 229; 19 N.R. 50; A.R. 182; 83 D.L.R. (3d) 452; [1978] W.W.R. 577; C.C.L.T. 225, at p. 261: 'There is no medium of exchange for happiness. There is no market for expectation of life. The monetary value of nonpecuniary loss is philosophical and policy exercise more than legal or logical one. The award must be fair and reasonable, fairness being gauged by earlier decisions; but the award must also of necessity be arbitrary or conventional...' Here, there is the added dimension of the exacerbation of pre‑existing lower back problem. find it impossible to separate consequences of the whiplash injury generally and the exacerbation of suffering attributable to his low back. will assess damages covering both aspects as did in King versus Leahey (1992), 109 N.S.R. (2d) 163. The interference with Mr. Gibbs' quality of life is more severe in this case than it was in King versus Leahey supra. I conclude for nonpecuniary damages under this heading for his past, present and future pain and suffering, loss of amenities, interference with his active lifestyle et cetera a reasonable award of general damages is $31,500.00. 8. PREJUDGMENT INTEREST The awards of general damages of $8,500.00, $2,500.00 and $31,500.00 will bear prejudgment interest at 2.5% from the date of the accident May 30, 1992, to date. 9. LOSS OF FUTURE EARNING CAPACITY conclude the evidence does not support an award of damages for diminution of earning capacity in the future, the setting of damages for this was recognized by the late Morrison, J., in Poirier Malcolm (1981), 47 N.S.R. (2d) 616 where at pp. 627‑628 Morrison, J., stated: 'This being case of diminution of earning capacity which is incapable of precise calculation rather than complete loss of earning capacity feel that the question of damages for future pecuniary loss of earnings should be included as an item under general damages."" The evidence in this case is unlike the evidence in such cases as: ""King v. Leahey (1992), 109 N.S.R. (2d) 163 ($20,000), Nicholson v. Attorney General et at. (1992), 1991 CanLII 4275 (NS SC), 110 N.S.R. (2d) 181, confirmed on appeal (1993), 1992 CanLII 2527 (NS CA), 117 N.S.R. (2d) 46 ($21,000.00), Smith Gardiner (1992), 112 N.S.R. (2d) 64 ($42,000) and Newman and Fraser LaMarche (1994), 1994 CanLII 4343 (NS SC), 131 N.S.R. (2d) 165, confirmed on appeal ($26,000)."" In this case Mr. Gibbs is continuing in his employment, in his chosen field, with very high probability of continuation of his employment in the nature and area of employment of his choice. Such circumstances do not warrant any conclusion of any possible limitation or diminution of his employment horizon that would warrant compensation.

2)Mitigating circumstances included the absence of a criminal record; his abstinence from alcohol since the assault; the absence of penile penetration; his remorse and apology to the victim and to the court; his serious health problems; his ability to rehabilitate and the fact that he was a model citizen prior to the assault.","[0, 1, 4, 3, 5, 6, 2, 8, 7, 9]",821,"Q.B.C.R.N.J. No. 3147 J.C. M.J. IN THE QUEEN'S BENCH JUDICIAL CENTRE OF MOOSE JAW BETWEEN: HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN and ACHIEL VAN DE WIELE Walter A. Wall for the Crown Michael Megaw for the accused JUDGMENT SCHEIBEL J. September 25, 1996 [1] The accused has been convicted of sexual assault. [2] The Crown, in seeking sentence of 1/2 to years, categorizes this offence as rape. They indicate there was no prior romantic connection between the victim and the accused, and that she pleaded with him not to do this. The Crown point out the victim suffered bruising and soreness from the incident. [3] The Crown submit that the victim incurred the displeasure of the community and lost her job because the community chose the accused's interest over hers. In addition, the Crown states the victim was harassed and had her property damaged and was forced to go for counselling. [4] The accused claims the victim lost her job because of her inability to satisfactorily perform her duties and that it had nothing to do with the sexual assault. They state the property damage and vandalism has no connection to this case. In any event, the defence claims the Crown has failed to prove this assertion. [5] The accused refers to the new sections in the Criminal Code with respect to alternative measures of sentencing and requests that he be given a non-custodial sentence. [6] Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code reaffirms the principle that sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. [7] Section 718.2 states the sentence passed must also take into consideration that sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender. [8] The Criminal Code goes on to say that sentence for similar offences committed in similar circumstances. In series of decisions, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal have stated that there is three year threshold sentence for sexual assault where there is penetration. The sentence is to be increased or decreased from the three year term based on the circumstances of the individual case. [9] However, s. 718.2(d) of the Criminal Code provides that an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances. In addition, the Criminal Code states that all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders. [10] Prior to these new provisions being enacted the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal held in R. v. Roberts (1995), 1995 CanLII 3924 (SK CA), 128 Sask.R. 158, that where there was sexual assault with no proof of actual penetration, electronic monitoring was not an option. In that case the Court of Appeal held that electronic monitoring is permitted only in cases involving offences which are non-violent and do not carry the presumption of incarceration. This principle was also advanced in R. v. McLeod (R.G.) (1992), 1992 CanLII 8279 (SK CA), 109 Sask.R. 8; 42 W.A.C. 8; 81 C.C.c.(3d) 83 (C.A.). [11] It is necessary to consider whether the new provisions of the Criminal Code change the established range of sentences for sexual assault. [12] All sexual assaults are serious crimes of violence and as such must be strongly denounced by the Court. sentence other than custodial term for this type of sexual assault would not meet the fundamental principle referred to in s. 718.1, that the sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. [13] Nor would non-custodial sentence, in case such as this, meet the general principle of sentencing established over the years for such crimes. [14] This case arose in small town and virtually the entire community has lined up in support of either the victim or the accused. Those in support of the accused feel the accused should not be incarcerated. Those in support of the victim feel long term of imprisonment is justified. [15] It is clear that any sentence imposed will be viewed by one side or the other as too lenient or excessively high. [16] It is my duty to pass sentence that reflects the seriousness of the offence, that punishes the accused for his actions, that will deter the accused and others from committing such offences and one that will protect the public and maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice. In addition, must pass sentence that is conducive to the rehabilitation of the offender and one that does not seek vengeance. [17] The accused is 58 years old. He has no prior criminal record. Until this event he appears to have led an exemplary life. Clearly alcohol was not only the major factor in the commission of this offence, but am satisfied the offence would not have occurred if the accused had not been drinking. Even though have concluded there was no actual penetration, nevertheless this was serious sexual assault. [18] The actions of the accused are totally out of repeated. Since the incident, the accused has abstained from alcohol and states he will never consume it again. The accused, in his address to the Court, gave serious heart- wrenching apology for his actions. He apologized to the victim, to his family and to the Court for his actions. He is deeply sorry for his involvement. [19] He is currently under doctors care and taking medication. His actions have affected him so gravely that he is on the verge of nervous breakdown. am firmly of the view that the accused will never re-offend in the future. [20] On the other hand, I cannot ignore the impact upon the victim. In addition to the assault she has lost her job in the community and is ostracized in the town. She is also currently on medication as result of this incident and is taking counselling. This offence has had grave consequences for her because some people appear to treat her as the offender rather than the victim. [21] This incident has been tragic for both parties, however, must not loose sight of the fact that it was the punished accordingly. [22] In the absence of mitigating factors, sentence in the range of three years would be just and fair. The following factors lead me to the conclusion that a lower sentence is justified in this case. 1. The accused has no prior criminal record; 2. This offence was motivated by alcohol and the accused has, since the incident, voluntarily quit using alcohol; 3. The accused was a model citizen until this offence; 4. The accused immediately removed his finger from the victim's vagina when she asked him not to do this and did not pursue the assault; 5. There was no penile penetration; 6. The accused has publicly apologized to the victim and to the Court for his actions and is genuinely filled with 7. The accused will loose his job as result of this incident; 8. The accused is suffering from serious health problems; 9. There is virtually no chance that the accused will ever commit another criminal offence; 10.A lengthy sentence will seriously affect the accused's ability to rehabilitate. [23] Taking all of the factors of sentencing into account, it is the sentence of this Court that you serve a term of 18 months in a provincial correctional centre. [24] Having imposed a custodial sentence of less than two years, I must now deal with s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code which permits the court to allow the accused to serve his term in the community. This section has just recently come into force. am not aware of any judicial cases applying this section in sexual assault cases. Indeed, electronic therefore I am of the view that given the seriousness of the offence, it would be contrary to the administration of justice to permit the accused to serve the sentence in the community even though the accused appears to meet the requirements of s. 742.1(a) and (b) of the Criminal Code. am left with no alternative. Therefore, the sentence must be served in a provincial correctional centre. [25] In addition, pursuant to the mandatory terms of s. 100 of the Criminal Code, the accused is prohibited from having any fire arms, ammunition or explosive substances for period of ten years from his release from prison.",b_1996canlii5100.txt,"The accused, convicted of sexual assault, requested a non-custodial sentence pursuant to s742.1 of the Criminal Code.

No. 68 of 2012 Judicial Centre: Battleford BETWEEN: HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN and PAUL MARY LEROUX Counsel: Michel L.J. Piché for the Crown Paul Mary Leroux on behalf of himself JUDGMENT ACTON J. November 5, 2013 [1] The accused has been charged with 14 counts of indecent assault and three counts of gross indecency against 14 individuals, all of whom were boys who attended the Beauval Indian Residential School between January 1, 1959 and December 31, 1967. The residential school was located at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. [2] The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys at the Beauval Indian Residential School. The accused had an ability to interact and bond with the people in his life. In spite of lack of significant post-secondary education and the loss of both of his parents at the age of 15, the accused had an amazing aptitude to relate to the boys at the school in manner which brought out their talents as both athletes and singers. [3] During his time at the school, from September 1959 to June 1962 and September 1963 to June 1967, he developed the intermural hockey, competitive fastball and softball teams, and the Beauval Warriors, which was the regional champion hockey team through most of the years that he developed and coached the team. During these years he also started the boys’ choir, developing the musical and vocal talents of many of the boys at the school. The choir travelled to and performed at various villages and towns in the vicinity. All of the members of the choir were especially proud to appear on television in Prince Albert at Christmas time in 1964 and cut an LP recording of their songs. [4] The boys at the school looked up to the accused, who was the dorm supervisor, as choirmaster, sports coach, mentor, friend, and parental figure in their lives. [5] Most of the boys started school at the Beauval Indian Residential School at the age of six, seven or eight. This was generally the first time they had been away from home, where they had lived in small log cabins or tents, where their father was hunter, trapper and fisherman, and where the means of travel was dog sled in the winter and boat in the summer. Their families’ food supply was from the land. Most often they came from family with numerous siblings and large extended family. [6] The huge four-storey brick dormitory with as many as 80 boys from ages six to 15 sharing one dormitory, one large bathroom and one playroom with lockers until 1963, and then sharing two dormitories with 30 or 40 boys, all between the ages of six and 15 years, was, to say the least, overwhelming to these young boys. [7] To most of them, the accused was the one person who seemed to care for them and with whom they bonded. [8] It is apparent that the accused truly did care for them and in many ways these boys were the most important people in his entire life. [9] However, as time progressed and the closeness of the relationships of the accused with many of the boys in his care grew closer, there became times when the relationship with various boys crossed the line from appropriate and acceptable behaviour to become acts which were totally inappropriate. They were known at the time as acts of indecent assault and gross indecency. In today’s terminology, these acts relate to offences now known as sexual assault and sexual interference. [10] Most of the boys affected were between the ages of 11 and 15. By the time they realized what was occurring, the boys found there was no one to turn to for help. Some felt like prisoners of the accused. [11] few of the victims attempted to tell one of the priests or nuns what was happening. However, they were not believed and generally punished for making up such stories. As one of the victims stated, the accused was the golden-haired boy of the nuns and the priests and to them he could do no wrong. Others knew that there was no possibility of obtaining help from the priests or nuns and knew that even though they would be with their parents at Christmas (unless they were snowed in) and with them in July and August, their parents would not believe them either or understand what they were talking about. [12] Beauval was residential school in which the girls resided in one half of the building and the boys in the other half but attended co-educational classes. There was clear disconnect between the perceptions of life at school and life in the residence. The former teachers who testified were quite certain that no one was ever punished for speaking their native tongue or discouraged from doing so. The boys testified (all of whom are over 50 and many over the age of 60) adamantly that they were punished for speaking their own language and were only allowed to speak English. [13] It became apparent to the court that while in class, the children were expected to speak English and only English and to speak Cree or Dené was an act of disobedience. [14] However, in the playground, in the dorms, on picnics with the dorm supervisors and anywhere other than the classroom, speaking to your fellow students in Cree or Dené was permissible. In fact, some of the missionary priests were relatively fluent in either Cree or Dené, depending on which reserves they had spent time. Often part of Mass was delivered in Cree or Dené, with one of the hymn books being in English and one being in Cree and Dené. [15] Discipline was not really an issue at the school and particularly with the accused due to his relationship with the boys that he supervised. Occasionally, an individual might receive strap on the hand or slap with ruler, but normally discipline outside the classroom consisted of either kneeling on the floor by the ping-pong table for 15 to 20 minutes or missing one-half of the Sunday night movie. The Sunday night movie was highlight of the week for all of the children at the school. [16] To small and often homesick boy, slap with the ruler or the requirement to kneel by the ping-pong table for period of time often seemed like cruel and unusual punishment, which carried over through 50 years of memory to become brutal and cruel acts of physical abuse. [17] There was evidence presented to the court of memories of: having to stand out in the -30˚ cold without proper clothing and being locked out for considerable period of time; having to get up at 5:00 a.m. every day to serve Mass; or having your clothes taken away on the first day at school and not returned to you, or returned to you at the end of the school year when you had outgrown them. [18] We all have childhood memories of mistreatment of one kind or another which may crystalize in our minds as the years pass. There was evidence before the court that in all likelihood, being locked out in the cold without proper clothing for hours on end was actually being outside with winter clothing on, but having the door locked for 15 minutes while the older boys mopped the floor of the playroom without the small boys running through and tracking up the hardwood floor. [19] Mass was mandatory on Sundays and few days during Lent. Otherwise, it was optional and seldom attended except for whoever volunteered to be the altar boys. The altar boys were awakened at 6:30 a.m. (which may have felt like 5:00 a.m.) to serve Mass at 7:00 a.m. There were rewards and recognition at the end of the school year for attending Mass more often than others. There was protocol whereby if boys volunteered to be altar boys and learned Latin, they could work their way up to being Knights of the Altar. [20] There are numerous photos of boys wearing their beaded jackets, moccasins and beaver mitts in spite of the accusations by some that these were taken away and never returned. [21] The normal procedure upon arrival at the school was for all of the boys’ clothes to be marked with indelible ink with their locker number so that when their clothes were sent to the laundry and were returned folded and left placed on the ping-pong table, each boy could find his pile of clothes by his locker number. [22] It is also apparent that some of the testimony of being strapped at least 25 times on each hand every day for three years was an extreme embellishment which increased significantly in both numbers and vivid recollection over the last 50 years. [23] Many of the victims attempted (with considerable success) to put these acts of sexual violation out of their minds for much of their adult lives. So much so that when the RCMP was sending letters out to former students in the late 1990s to determine if anyone had been sexually molested by the accused, only one individual responded. This was the result of the accused having been recently convicted of such activities with young men between the ages of 14 and 18 in the Northwest Territories where the accused had taken up employment after leaving Beauval. The individual was E.G. In spite of E.G.’s persistence, he was eventually advised by the RCMP that it did not have sufficient evidence to prosecute and the matter was being dropped. [24] Then in approximately the year 2000, many of the complainants received letters from law firm indicating that if they had been abused at residential school, they could in all likelihood obtain damages through the court system. Almost all of the complainants stepped forward and provided details of the various and numerous acts of sexual assault or sexual interference committed upon them by the accused. This was followed by an examination for discovery, and an IAP application with details of alleged abuse and an eventual out-of-court cash settlement. [25] At no time did anyone report this to the RCMP. Then in approximately 2009, Constable Joy, who had been the rookie RCMP officer transporting the accused to and from his trial in the Northwest Territories, had worked his way up to be with special unit in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. He came across the name of Paul Leroux. Constable Joy took on personal project of attempting to locate individuals who attended Beauval Indian Residential School when Paul Leroux was there and who may have been subject to acts of sexual assault. Constable Joy spent months going back again and again and again to these individuals who refused to talk to him about such matters. Some of these individuals had lived their entire lives without bringing the matter totally before the public other than the civil lawsuits, examinations for discovery and IAP applications, all of which were settled out of court. Needless to say, most of these individuals were extremely reluctant when in their 60s, having been married for most of their adult lives, having had children and now grandchildren, to stand up in public courtroom explaining sexual acts that were committed upon them when they were 11 to 15 years of age. Very few of the complainants felt any need at this point to get revenge or prosecute the accused. Some indicated to Constable Joy that they felt no obligation to the public to punish the accused further. He was now 72 years of age, and had been sentenced to 10 years in jail in the late 1990s for such acts. Why not leave him alone? [26] Undeterred, Constable Joy continued to return and return and return, trying to get the individuals to talk about things that they had put out of their minds many years ago and had no need to make public at this stage in their lives. [27] Eventually Constable Joy succeeded in accumulating the 14 complainants and had the charges laid in 2011. There was then the preliminary hearing in 2012 and now the trial in the fall of 2013. [28] It is quite understandable that the testimony of each of the complainants varied substantially among each other and also among their own sworn statements. Often the original statement of claim was full of significant details and allegations. The examination for discovery often varied significantly from the statement of claim, with allegations made in the statement of claim completely forgotten in the examination for discovery and new allegations presented as well as contradictions between the two. [29] This was further exasperated by the preliminary hearing which again was often substantially different from either of the first two. Testimony at the actual trial often did not correlate with the preliminary hearing, the examination for discovery and the statement of claim. In fact, on occasion, there was complete denial of some of the primary allegations brought forth in the original statement of claim, examination for discovery and IAP application. [30] It is accepted that after 50 years, and this trial reaffirms, that acts which occurred in our childhood often become embellished and distorted and blamed for many of our personal shortcomings or personal failures later in life. [31] The complainants were in attendance for varying periods at varying times at the residential school. Some were there as early as 1957 and remembered when the accused arrived and left while he was still there. Others arrived after he was there and left about the same time. Others arrived toward the end of his tenure and left later. Some obtained Grade education and then left at the age of 13 to live life of alcohol and drug addiction, violence and crime, incarceration, assaults and sexual assaults on spouses, children and grandchildren. Others excelled in hockey, others excelled in choir, others excelled in both. Many showed great scholastic and artistic talents. Some obtained their Grade and went out to live rather conventional and stable family life. Others went on to other schools after obtaining their Grade or to attend other residential schools or boarding houses in larger towns to obtain their Grade 12 education. [32] Some, although not near as many as were capable, had the advantage of pursuing further post-secondary education and becoming teachers and other professionals. [33] There was much evidence before the court of physical and sexual abuse of many of the complainants by priests, nuns or other students. The allegations are not limited to the accused. With over 50 years having passed since the occurrence of some of these events and the contradictory evidence provided by individuals on four different occasions, it is extremely difficult to glean what is the factual truth of who did what to whom and when, as opposed to the “now” perception of those past events. [34] Some of the complainants were very quiet, soft-spoken, respectful individuals who obviously lived quiet life and had family support. This was apparent by their attendance in the gallery at court. Others were fine, well spoken, outstanding individuals who spoke clearly and concisely. Some had family support there. Others had clearly asked to have the family support remain outside the courtroom until their testimony was completed. Other individuals were loud, disrespectful of others, ignored direction and protocol and had had neither stable life nor family, but rather one filled with crime, addictions, violence, incarceration and instability. All gave their evidence to give to the best of their ability. Prior Applications [35] Originally, this trial was set to be heard by judge and jury. The court was required to make decision respecting pre-trial application for the admission of similar fact evidence by the Crown. This decision was rendered September 16, 2013, dismissing the application. R. v. Leroux, 2013 SKQB 336 (CanLII), [2013] S.J. No. 588 (QL) [36] Just prior to commencement of the trial, there was re-election to judge alone. At the close of the case for the Crown, there was an application for the court to reconsider the issue of similar fact evidence as it relates to evidence provided in each of the separate counts of the indictment to allow the similar facts to be used to support the credibility of the complainants on the other counts in the indictment. [37] The court reserved its decision respecting this application and undertook to render decision on this issue at the time of its final judgment. [38] Although the complainants attended the Beauval Indian Residential School at varying times for varying periods and obtained varying degrees of education, there are number of commonalities also known as similar fact evidence. These included: 1) The initial touching involved the accused placing his hand under the covers and fondling the victim’s genitalia over top of his pyjamas. 2) These activities occurred at night after the boys were asleep, normally between 9:30 or 10:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. 3) The touching would escalate on subsequent occasions to the accused waking the complainant from sleep and telling him to come to his office/bedroom. 4) The accused would take down the victim’s pyjamas, fondle his penis, and would ask the victim to stroke his penis so that each would eventually have an erection. 5) As the number of times that the victim was awakened and taken to the office during the night would increase to the point where the accused and the victim were performing fellatio on each other and eventually laying on the bed with the accused behind the victim with his penis between the victim’s legs simulating intercourse until ejaculation or performing acts of anal intercourse on the victim. 6) Often the victims were members of the choir or the Beauval Warriors midget hockey team. [39] The court does accept that there is less likelihood of moral prejudice, reasoning prejudice and propensity reasoning in judge alone trial as opposed to jury trial. [40] However, as stated by the Supreme Court in R. v. Handy, 2002 SCC 56 (CanLII), [2002] S.C.R. 908, at para. 146: 146 Further, there is risk, evident in this case, that where the “similar facts” are denied by the accused, the court will be caught in conflict between seeking to admit what appears to be cogent evidence bearing on material issue and the need to avoid unfairness to the right of the accused to respond. The accused has limited opportunity to respond. Logistical problems may be compounded by the lapse of time, surprise, and the collateral issue rule, which will prevent (in the interest of effective use of court resources) trials within trials on the similar facts. Nor is the accused allowed to counter evidence of discreditable conduct with similar fact evidence in support of his or her credibility (as discussed in Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, supra, at s. 11.74). Thus the practical realities of the trial process reinforce the prejudice inherent in the poisonous nature of the propensity evidence itself. [41] The renewed application by the Crown is for the evidence that each of the 14 complainants to be considered and allowed is similar fact evidence on each of the other counts to bolster the credibility of each complainant. This is far too broad. To allow the evidence of all 14 complainants to apply to all 17 charges is far too prejudicial to the accused and reduces the ability of the court to compartmentalize charges, leading to propensitory reasoning. [42] The court takes note of the recent decision of R. v. Jesse, 2012 SCC 21 (CanLII), [2012] S.C.R. 716. In that decision, the Supreme Court of Canada allowed the Crown to introduce similar fact evidence showing that in 1995, jury had convicted the accused of sexual assault. There was high degree of similarity between the 1995 sexual assault and the one for which the accused was on trial and the similar fact evidence would be circumstantial evidence going to the issue of identity. In the current case before the court, identity is not an issue, however as stated by Moldaver J. writing for the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada at para. 52: 52 ... prior conviction constitutes strong proof that the similar act conduct in question occurred. In that sense, it has greater probative value than an unproven allegation (see, e.g., D.M. Paciocco and L. Stuesser, The Law of Evidence (rev. 5th ed. 2008), at pp. 144-147). While conviction may be harder to respond to than an unproven allegation, that does not make the conviction inadmissible. Just because piece of evidence operates unfortunately for an accused does not of itself render the evidence inadmissible or the trial unfair (see R. v. Corbett, 1988 CanLII 80 (SCC), [1988] S.C.R. 670, at pp. 724-25, per La Forest J., dissenting on other grounds). [43] The court takes particular note of decision of Binnie J. in R. v. Handy, supra, wherein he states at paras. 73 The requirement to identify the material issue “in question” (i.e., the purpose for which the similar fact evidence is proffered) does not detract from the probative value/prejudice balance, but is in fact essential to it. Probative value cannot be assessed in the abstract. The utility of the evidence lies precisely in its ability to advance or refute live issue pending before the trier of fact. 74 The issues in question derive from the facts alleged in the charge and the defences advanced or reasonably anticipated. It is therefore incumbent on the Crown to identify the live issue in the trial to which the evidence of disposition is said to relate. If the issue has ceased to be in dispute, as for example when the fact is admitted by the accused, then the evidence is irrelevant and it must be excluded: R. v. Clermont, 1986 CanLII 26 (SCC), [1986] S.C.R. 131, at p. 136; R. v. Bosley (1992), 1992 CanLII 2838 (ON CA), 18 C.R. (4th) 347 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 360; R. v. Proctor (1992), 1992 CanLII 2763 (MB CA), 69 C.C.C. (3d) 436 (Man. C.A.), at p. 447; R. v. Hanna (1990), 1990 CanLII 11027 (BC CA), 57 C.C.C. (3d) 392 (B.C.C.A.); and B. (L.), supra, at p. 50. The relative importance of the issue in the particular trial may also have bearing on the weighing up of factors for and against admissibility. Similar fact evidence that is virtually conclusive of minor issue may still be excluded for reasons of overall prejudice. 75 The “issues in question” are not, it should be emphasized, categories of admissibility. Their identification is simply an element of the admissibility analysis which, as stated, turns on weighing probative value against prejudice. ... 76 The principal driver of probative value in case such as this is the connectedness (or nexus) that is established between the similar fact evidence and the offences alleged, particularly where the connections reveal “degree of distinctiveness or uniqueness” (B. (C.R.), supra, at p. 735). As stated by Cory J. in Arp, supra, at para. 48: ... where similar fact evidence is adduced to prove fact in issue, in order to be admissible, the trial judge should evaluate the degree of similarity of the alleged acts and decide whether the objective improbability of coincidence has been established. Only then will the evidence have sufficient probative value to be admitted. [44] It is also noted by Binnie J. in para. 78 that the issue is actus reus as is the issue in the current case before the court: 78 The issue in the present case is not identification but the actus reus of the offence. The point is not that the degree of similarity in such case must be higher or lower than in an identification case. The point is that the issue is different, and the drivers of cogency in relation to the desired inferences will therefore not be the same. As Grange J.A. correctly pointed out 20 years ago in R. v. Carpenter (1982), 1982 CanLII 3308 (ON CA), 142 D.L.R. (3d) 237 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 244: The degree of similarity required will depend upon the issues in the particular case, the purpose for which the evidence is sought to be introduced and the other evidence. [45] Binnie J. goes on further to set out the factors to be considered in connecting similar facts to circumstances, whereas in the current situation, the Crown wishes to use the similar fact evidence to support the credibility of each of the individual complainants. Binnie J. states at paras. 82 The trial judge was called on to consider the cogency of the proffered similar fact evidence in relation to the inferences sought to be drawn, as well as the strength of the proof of the similar facts themselves. Factors connecting the similar facts to the circumstances set out in the charge include: (1) proximity in time of the similar acts: D. (L.E.), supra, at p. 125; R. v. Simpson (1977), 1977 CanLII 1142 (ON CA), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 337 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 345; R. v. Huot (1993), 1993 CanLII 8652 (ON CA), 16 O.R. (3d) 214 (C.A.), at p. 220; (2) extent to which the other acts are similar in detail to the charged conduct: Huot, supra, at p. 218; R. v. Rulli (1999), 1999 CanLII 3712 (ON CA), 134 C.C.C. (3d) 465 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 471; C. (M.H.), supra, at p. 772; (3) number of occurrences of the similar acts: Batte, supra, at pp. 227-28; (4) circumstances surrounding or relating to the similar acts (Litchfield, supra, at p. 358); (5) any distinctive feature(s) unifying the incidents: Arp, supra, at paras. 43-45; R. v. Fleming (1999), 1999 CanLII 18921 (NL CA), 171 Nfld. P.E.I.R. 183 (Nfld. C.A.), at paras. 104-5; Rulli, supra, at p. 472; (6) intervening events: R. v. Dupras, 2000 BCSC 1128 (CanLII), [2000] B.C.J. No. 1513 (QL) (S.C.), at para. 12; (7) any other factor which would tend to support or rebut the underlying unity of the similar acts. 83 On the other hand, countervailing factors which have been found helpful in assessing prejudice include the inflammatory nature of the similar acts (D. (L.E.), at p. 124) and whether the Crown can prove its point with less prejudicial evidence. In addition, as stated, the court was required to take into account the potential distraction of the trier of fact from its proper focus on the facts charged, and the potential for undue time consumption. These were collectively described earlier as moral prejudice and reasoning prejudice. 84 This list is intended to be helpful rather than exhaustive. Not all factors will exist (or be necessary) in every case. comparable approach is utilized in other common law jurisdictions, including England (see Director of Public Prosecutions v. Kilbourne, [1973] A.C. 729 (H.L.), at p. 758), and in the United States (see C. B. Mueller and L. C. Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence (2nd ed. 1994 Supp. 2001), vol. 2, at s. 161; United States v. Enjady, 134 F.3d 1427 (10th Cir. 1998), certiorari denied, 525 U.S. 887 (1998)). [46] The court has also noted the references made in paras. 90 and 91 which state: 90 On the facts of B. (C.R.), the majority concluded that the accused was shown to have situation specific propensity to abuse sexually children to whom he stood in parental relationship, and there was close match between the “distinct and particular” propensity demonstrated in the similar fact evidence and the misconduct alleged in the charge, although even the majority considered the admissibility to be “borderline” (p. 739). Similar fact evidence is sometimes said to demonstrate “system” or “modus operandi”, but in essence the idea of “modus operandi” or “system” is simply the observed pattern of propensity operating in closely defined and circumscribed context. 91 References to “calling cards” or “signatures” or “hallmarks” or “fingerprints” similarly describe propensity at the admissible end of the spectrum precisely because the pattern of circumstances in which an accused is disposed to act in certain way are so clearly linked to the offence charged that the possibility of mere coincidence, or mistaken identity or mistake in the character of the act, is so slight as to justify consideration of the similar fact evidence by the trier of fact. The issue at that stage is no longer “pure” propensity or “general disposition” but repeated conduct in particular and highly specific type of situation. At that point, the evidence of similar facts provides compelling inference that may fill remaining gap in the jigsaw puzzle of proof, depending on the view ultimately taken (in this case) by the jury. [47] As in the current situation, it is not the sex acts themselves or the surrounding circumstances which are highly distinctive. Cogency is derived from the repetition rather than the distinctiveness. [48] Considering the factors to be considered, the court does find as follows: 1) Proximity and time of the similar acts The majority of the alleged acts occurred after the accused returned from Gravelbourg in September of 1963 and occurred between then and his departure in June of 1967. 2) Extent to which other acts are similar in detail to the charge conduct The acts are extremely similar in that they all involve commencement by touching of the victims by the accused while in their bunks at night when the lights are turned out. They escalate to being summoned by the accused to his office after all of the boys are asleep. These incidents then involve fondling the victim and encouraging the victim to fondle the accused, resulting in erections and ejaculations. Many of the assaults progressed to fellatio and attempts at anal intercourse. 3) Number of occurrences of similar acts There appears to have been in the range of 15 or more victims with anywhere from one to approximately 30 occurrences with each individual. 4) All of the individuals were students at the Beauval Indian Residential School and all under the supervision of the accused, many of whom were members of the boys’ choir or the Warriors hockey team or both. 5) Any distinctive features unifying the incidents See para. 49(2). 6) Intervening events All but one of the victims did not disclose the acts committed by the accused until approximately 2000, being anywhere from 35 to 40 years after the occurrence of the events. 7) The accused developed close personal relationship with each of the victims. [49] Considering these factors and the statement of Binnie J. in Handy, supra, at para. 134 In the usual course, frailties in the evidence would be left to the trier of fact, in this case the jury. However, where admissibility is bound up with, and dependent upon, probative value, the credibility of the similar fact evidence is factor that the trial judge, exercising his or her gatekeeper function is, in my view, entitled to take into consideration. Where the ultimate assessment of credibility was for the jury and not the judge to make, this evidence was potentially too prejudicial to be admitted unless the judge was of the view that it met the threshold of being reasonably capable of belief. the court does allow the similar fact evidence as set forth in para. 38 as similar fact evidence in each of the complaints with the other as circumstantial evidence which as gatekeeper may take into consideration allowing as much or as little weight to it as consider appropriate. [50] My decision is based on the fact that the gatekeeper and the trier of fact are the same individual in judge alone trial. As stated in my earlier decision hearing the original application, my decision would be entirely different if the matter was before jury. The Charges [51] The accused is charged with 14 counts of indecent assault, which were committed at or near Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan in the time period between January 1, 1959 and December 31, 1967, upon 14 separate individuals: G.J.W., H.J.A., J.E., T.F., G.A.G., E.G., L.A.G., D.L., J.R.M., N.G.M., M.J.M., M.V.P., G.T., G.R.M. [52] In addition, the accused is charged with acts of gross indecency during the same time, at the same place and with three of the same complainants, namely: T.F., M.J.M., G.R.M. [53] The court must apply the law that existed between 1959 and 1967 at which time the following sections of the Criminal Code, S.C. 1953-54, c. 51 applied: 148. Every male person who assaults another person with intent to commit buggery or who indecently assaults another male person is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for ten years and to be whipped. 149. Every one who commits an act of gross indecency with another person is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for five years. 132. Where an accused is charged with an offence under section 138, 141 or 148 in respect of person under the age of fourteen years, the fact that the person consented to the commission of the offence is not defence to the charge. [54] In the period between 1959 and 1967, the courts in Canada considered acts of gross indecency to be acts which are marked departure from decent conduct and crime against public morality which included but was not limited to anal intercourse, fellatio, and homosexual acts between two male persons of any age and whether consenting or not. Ingredients of the Offence [55] The offence of indecent assault as defined in s. 148 consists of any deliberate application of force that by its nature or circumstance has the quality of indecency. This is equivalent to various forms of what we now know as sexual assault, sexual touching or sexual interference. Under s. 132, if the person is under the age of 14 years, consent is not defence. [56] Some of the complainants were over the age of 14 years and under the age of majority being 21 years. All of the complainants were under the age of 18 years. [57] For ease of understanding, the Supreme Court of Canada has stated in R. v. Handy, supra, at para. 118, short and concise definition of sexual assault which states: 118 conviction for sexual assault requires proof beyond reasonable doubt of two basic elements, that the accused committed the actus reus and that he had the necessary mens rea. The actus reus of assault is unwanted sexual touching. The mens rea is the intention to touch, knowing of, or being reckless of, or wilfully blind to, lack of consent: R. v. Ewanchuk, 1999 CanLII 711 (SCC), [1999] S.C.R. 330, at para. [58] For the complainants 14 years of age and over, if the person is in position of trust or authority, sexual touching by the person in authority is now the crime of sexual exploitation. The offence of gross indecency has no equivalent in the current Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. As stated earlier, an offence whereby all homosexual acts between consenting adults were made illegal, to amount to gross indecency the act must have constituted marked departure from decent conduct and public morality. Consent is no defence. [59] It is also noted that there is distinction in law between consent and submission. Every consent involves submission but every submission does not involve consent. An agreement to engage in sexual activity by reason of an individual’s position of trust or exercise of authority may constitute submission but not consent. The relationship of authority is relevant factor to determine whether complainant does in fact consent or merely submits. [60] It is apparent from the facts as stated above that each of the complainants identified the accused as the individual involved. The incidents occurred at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. Each of the individuals viewed the accused as person in position of trust and authority. [61] The court has also considered the question of collusion or collaboration between the witnesses or the tainting of evidence by the actions of Constable Joy so as to raise the question as to whether the testimony is that of the complainant or the police officer. [62] After careful consideration of the fact that many of the complainants have lived their adult lives in close proximity to each other and have interacted on regular basis and encouraged each other to file claims for financial recourse, find no evidence to suggest collusion or collaboration among the complainants such that it would undermine the reliability of any particular witness’s testimony. Nor do find evidence that despite his good intentions, Constable Joy tainted their evidence by use of his knowledge of the trials in the Northwest Territories in which the accused was convicted of similar acts, and his continued pursuit over many visits to have the complainants step forward and make formal complaints against the accused. [63] It is important to remember that it is the responsibility of the Crown to prove each of the elements of the offence. There is no obligation on the accused to prove that any of the elements of the offence did not exist. [64] The first and most important principle of law applicable to every criminal case is the presumption of innocence. The accused enters the proceedings presumed to be innocent and the presumption of innocence remains throughout the case unless the Crown on the evidence put before me satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty. The Crown bears the burden of proving his guilt. The guilt must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. These rules are inextricably linked to the presumption of innocence and ensure that no innocent person is convicted. There is no burden on the accused to prove he is innocent. He does not have to prove anything. [65] reasonable doubt is not an imaginary or frivolous doubt. It is not based upon sympathy for or prejudice against anyone involved in these proceedings. Rather, it is based on reason and common sense. It is doubt that arises logically from the evidence or from an absence of evidence. [66] It is virtually impossible to prove anything to an absolute certainty and the Crown is not required to do so. Such standard would be impossibly high, however, the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt falls much closer to absolute certainty than to probable guilt. must not find the accused guilty unless am sure he is guilty. Even if believe he is probably guilty or likely guilty, that is not sufficient. In the circumstances, must give the benefit of the doubt to the accused and find him not guilty because the Crown would have failed to satisfy me of his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. [67] Credibility of the witnesses is of major significance in this trial. Reasonable doubt applies to the issue of credibility. may believe witness, disbelieve witness or may not fully believe or disbelieve one witness or group of witnesses. If have reasonable doubt about the accused’s guilt arising from the credibility of the witnesses, then must find him not guilty. The accused testified on his own behalf and must as well assess his testimony the same as any other witness keeping in mind the credibility of witnesses. may accept all, part or none of the accused’s evidence. If believe his testimony that he did not commit the offences charged, must find him not guilty. Even if do not believe his testimony and it leaves me with reasonable doubt about his guilt or about an essential element of the offences charged, must find him not guilty. If do not know who to believe, it means have reasonable doubt and must find him not guilty. Even if his testimony does not raise reasonable doubt about his guilt or about an essential element of the offence, if after considering all of the evidence am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt, must acquit. [68] In deciding the credibility of Crown witnesses, must consider that most of the complainants issued statement of claim involving the accused somewhere between the period from 1998 to 2004. The complainants testified under oath at the examinations for discovery, many of which occurred in 2002. Most of the complainants filed an IAP claim and have received financial settlements respecting their statement of claim and the IAP claim. The complainants also provided evidence under oath at the preliminary inquiry in 2012. Each of the complainants has now testified before me at the trial. This testimony relates to incidents which occurred when the complainants were boys at the Beauval Indian Residential School approximately 50 years ago. must determine what effect any of the differences have on my overall assessment of the witnesses’ credibility. They may have huge effect or no effect or somewhere in between. Not every difference is important. must consider the extent and nature of any difference. Was it central point or something peripheral? must consider any explanation the witness has given and whether the explanation was satisfactory. must also consider the complainants’ explanations as to why when they first revealed the alleged complaints against the accused in approximately 2000, they did not report the offences to the RCMP until, in the case of most complainants, 2009 and only after considerable coaxing from Constable Joy. [69] have heard 14 complainants testify about events that occurred when each of them was child. must remember that persons giving testimony in court, of whatever age, are individuals whose credibility and evidence must be assessed by reference to standards appropriate to their mental development, understanding and ability to communicate. When generally speaking, when adults testify about events that occur when they were child, their credibility should be assessed according to standards that are applicable to them as adult witnesses. But when the evidence of such witnesses relates to events that occurred in their childhood, then the presence of inconsistencies, such as those relating to time and location, should take into account the age of the witnesses at the time those events happened. must examine the testimony of each of the 14 complainants separately where it deals with events that happened when he was child by taking into account the circumstances as child at the time of those events. [70] The only way may use the evidence of extrinsic similar facts of one complainant to support the credibility of another complainant is if the evidence discloses distinctive pattern of conduct of the accused and whether it would defy coincidence that two or more people independently would lie or be mistaken in their testimony about the conduct of the accused. If there is distinctive pattern, then may use the evidence in assessing the complainant’s credibility. If do not find distinctive pattern of conduct, then must consider each count separately to determine if the evidence in relation to the count proves the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. [71] The elements of the offence of indecent assault are as follows: 1) The accused is the person who actually committed the offence of indecent assault. 2) The offence of indecent assault occurred at the time and place set out in the indictment, namely Beauval, Saskatchewan, between January 1, 1959 and December 31, 1967. 3) The accused applied force to the complainant directly or indirectly. 4) The accused intentionally applied force to the complainant in circumstances which had the quality of indecency. 5) The complainant was under the age of 14 years at the time of the alleged offence or that the complainant was the age of 14 years or older and did not consent to the application of force or did not consent validly due to the accused inducing the complainant to engage in the activity by abusing position of trust, power, or authority. 6) The complainant is male person. [72] With respect to the charge of gross indecency, the elements are: 1) The accused is the person who actually committed the offence of gross indecency. 2) The offence of gross indecency occurred at Beauval, Saskatchewan, between January 1, 1959 and December 31, 1967. 3) The acts of gross indecency were with the complainant either consensually or otherwise. 4) The acts committed are marked departure from decent conduct expected of the average Canadian in the circumstances which existed at the time and crime against public morality which includes but is not limited to anal intercourse, fellatio and other homosexual acts between two male persons of any age, whether consenting or not. [73] will now proceed to comment on each of the respective counts separately. Count Indecent assault on G.J.W. [74] G.J.W. was born in 1950 and attended Beauval Indian Residential School from September 1957 to June of 1966. G.J.W. testified at his examination for discovery that the first incident happened when he was nine years old. In his evidence to Constable Joy, he indicated he was seven, eight or nine years old and that the sexual assaults happened every week for number of years. At the end of the examination for discovery, he indicated that when he left at the age of 15½, it had happened few times. At the trial he indicated the indecent assaults never happened on the top floor, but rather in the second floor dorm. He remembers the accused calling him to the bedroom in the night and offering him coffee. He alleges the accused played with his penis until he got an erection. He was 10 or 11 years old. He tried to push the accused away. G.J.W. was often scared it would happen again when the accused would walk through the dormitory late at night. He indicated at trial that he was fondled five or six times in his bed. He testified that he could have been 11 or 12 years old. G.J.W. was sure that it was at least the fall of 1963 after the new construction. He would have been 13 years of age. He also indicated that the accused touched him in the bunks and played with his penis five or six times between the time he was 13 and 15 years of age. [75] G.J.W. was reserved, straightforward and credible witness. He may have been mistaken about the earlier years and whether he was indecently assaulted in the dormitory on the fourth floor and whether it was an elderly priest to whom he delivered lunch. However, his evidence respecting being fondled in his bunk by the accused five or six times in the final two years when he was between the ages of 13 and 15½ is most credible. A conviction shall be entered to Count 1. Count Indecent assault on H.J.A. [76] H.J.A was born in 1953 and attended Beauval Indian Residential School from 1960 to 1969, obtaining Grade 9. H.J.A. testified that the accused would take him to his bedroom late at night, give him candies, lay him on his bed, fondle his penis and anus and put his finger up his anus. This would make it sore. He testified that the accused had him sleeping beside him in the accused’s bedroom five or six times, being every second night for month. He also testified that the accused took pictures of him and other former students in the shower. At the preliminary hearing, he testified that he slept with the accused five nights in row, but that the accused was fully dressed. In his examination for discovery he indicated that the accused had sex with him for month or month and half. He indicated to Constable Joy this occurred in 1962 and 1963, and he did not remember whether he touched the accused. Whereas at the preliminary he said that he did not touch the accused. In the examination for discovery he testified the accused took his jeans off part way through and kissed H.J.A. on the mouth. In the examination for discovery he also indicated that the accused had anal intercourse with him, touched his genitalia and he was required to touch the accused. H.J.A. told Constable Joy that the accused put his hand on the penis area of his pants for half minute and then H.J.A. left. [77] The testimony of H.J.A. was sufficiently inconsistent in his earlier sworn statements at the examination for discovery and preliminary hearing in comparison with the testimony at trial that the court has reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused respecting this count. This count is dismissed. Count Indecent assault on J.E. [78] J.E. was born in 1949 and attended school at Beauval Indian Residential School from September of 1962 until June of 1965 when he finished his Grade 6. When he commenced Grade he was 13 years of age. J.E. testified that he was only in the accused’s office once when the accused took him there in the middle of the night, fondled him, gave him beer, told him to take off his clothes, took him to his bed and had anal intercourse with J.E., which made him bleed. He believed that he was probably 15 years of age at the time. J.E. was very credible witness. accept his evidence with respect to the indecent assault. A conviction shall be entered on Count 3. Counts and Indecent assault and act of gross indecency on T.F. [79] T.F. was born in 1950. He attended Beauval Indian Residential School from September of 1957 to June of 1968 when he obtained Grade 8, and then took Grades and 10 in the “Anne of Green Gables Building” by the rectory. He attended North Battleford Composite High School for his Grades 11 and 12. T.F. made many statements in his testimony which the court accepts that he fully believes. However, many of these statements were proven to be factually untrue, particularly the cause of death of one P.J. and the name of the other individual who won the trip to Quebec. However, the court does accept his testimony respecting three boys being in the accused’s office, being provided with an alcoholic drink, shown pornographic magazines of naked women, being taken into the accused’s bedroom one at time, having his pants pulled down and fondled. Also, that T.F. rebuffed further advances by the accused. The court does enter a conviction to Count 4. [80] Based on the evidence accepted by the court, the court has reasonable doubt respecting the commitment of an act of gross indecency under Count 5 and does dismiss Count 5. Count Indecent assault on G.A.G. [81] G.A.G. was born in 1949 and started school at the Beauval Indian Residential School in fall of 1957 and attended until June of 1964 when he obtained his Grade 8. The witness was quite honest and open with the fact that he did not remember details of much that happened 53 years ago. The alleged indecent assault was thought to be fatherly act at the time. It was not until he was much older and had discussed matters with other individuals who were filing claims did he come to believe that it was an indecent assault. [82] The court has reasonable doubt as to whether or not there was an indecent assault or fatherly touching by supervisor in G.A.G.’s early years at the school. The court does dismiss Count 6. Count Indecent assault on E.G. [83] E.G. was born in 1946. He attended Beauval Indian Residential School from August of 1954 to 1963. E.G. then attended other residential schools until he obtained his Grade 12 in 1967. Much of the peripheral evidence presented by the accused was obviously believed by him, but which the court does not accept. The court does accept the testimony of the witness relating to him having to masturbate the accused on more than one occasion and the attempted but failed attempt at sodomy. [84] It is noted that E.G. is the first individual to file complaint with the RCMP and did so prior to receiving any correspondence from law firm suggesting he may be entitled to financial compensation. [85] The court does enter a conviction on Count 7. Count Indecent assault on L.A.G. [86] L.A.G. was born in 1957. He went to Beauval Indian Residential School from September 1963 to June 1973. The witness has good memory for his supervisors and which floor dormitory he was on, being the top floor, for the time during which the accused remained at Beauval. However, during that period of time, the accused was the supervisor on the second floor, not the fourth floor. Even though the accused did not supervise on the fourth floor, when L.A.G. woke up in the night he saw someone sitting in the office with the light on on the fourth floor, so it must have been the accused. The testimony of L.A.G. is vague on both details and number of times and strong on speculation. The court has a reasonable doubt respecting this count and does therefore dismiss this count. Count Indecent assault on D.L. [87] D.L. was born in 1953 and commenced school at Beauval Indian Residential School in September of 1960, leaving in December of 1965. He started at the age of seven and graduated with Grade education. Much of the testimony of the complainant is inconsistent with earlier sworn testimony and although am quite sure the witness believed the truth of what he was testifying in court, much of it leaves considerable doubt about the reality, leaving the court with reasonable doubt. Therefore, Count 9 is dismissed. Count 10 Indecent assault on J.R.M. [88] J.R.M. was born in 1951. He commenced school at the Beauval Indian Residential School in September of 1959 and continued to attend school there until June of 1965. He was in the boys’ choir for five years commencing approximately six months after his arrival and played hockey in the intermural level. Although the witness was clear about much of what happened while at the residential school, the court has reasonable doubt about an indecent assault having occurred, there being lack of evidence of touching for sexual purpose. Therefore, the court does dismiss Count 10. Count 11 Indecent assault on N.G.M. [89] N.G.M. was born in 1951. He started school at Beauval Indian Residential School in September of 1959 and continued until June of 1966. Although the records indicate he has Grade 8, his recollection is that he only had Grade and left at Christmas at the age of 13½. The testimony of N.G.M. was quite credible, particularly with respect to T.F. and him when they were 11 years of age, being mixed drink which they referred to as martini in the office of the accused. Then the boys went to bed and later that evening, the accused stopped at his bunk, fondled his genitals under the blanket and told him to come to his room, where the accused fondled him and he fondled the accused. The witness was very credible and believable and the court accepts his testimony. Therefore a conviction is entered on Count 11. Counts 12 and 13 Indecent assault and gross indecency on M.J.M. [90] M.J.M. was born in 1949 and commenced school at Beauval Indian Residential School in 1956. He was then diagnosed with tuberculosis and was in sanitarium for 1957, 1958 and 1959, returning in the fall of 1960, obtaining his Grade in June of 1967. He then continued his education in Meadow Lake, obtaining Grade 11 and subsequently commercial art course at Red River College. M.J.M. was very straightforward and credible witness. He told of being given alcohol by the accused, was shown pornographic books to get aroused and then taken to his bedroom, where the accused involved him in both fellatio and anal intercourse on numerous occasions. It seemed like once month for three years. accept this evidence as to the facts he related. A conviction will be entered to both Counts 12 and 13. Count 14 Indecent assault on M.V.P. [91] M.V.P. was born in 1949 and attended Beauval Indian Residential School from September of 1956 to June of 1965, obtaining Grade education. M.V.P. was member of both the boys’ choir and the Warriors hockey team of which the accused was the choir master and the hockey coach. Although M.V.P. had discrepancies in his testimony respecting peripheral issues, he was most believable and credible witness. Whether there was an indecent assault of M.V.P. in the shower or whether there was only an attempt, the court accepts the evidence of M.V.P. that there was in fact an indecent assault in the bedroom of the accused when M.V.P. was approximately 15 years of age, and I find the Crown has proven the charge beyond a reasonable doubt and a conviction shall be entered to Count 14. Count 15 Indecent assault on G.T. [92] The Crown has accepted that it has not proven the actus reus. Count 15 is dismissed. Counts 16 and 17 Indecent assault and gross indecency on G.R.M. [93] G.R.M. was born in 1952. After spending two years in school at Onion Lake, he attended Beauval Indian Residential School from September 1962 to the end of 1963 before he returned to the Onion Lake Residential School for 1964 and 1965, returning to Beauval in September of 1965 until June of 1967. He received his Grade education. G.R.M. was very impressive, straightforward, and credible witness. The court has no doubt that G.R.M. was fondled by the accused and was involved in the acts of fellatio and mutual masturbation with the accused on numerous occasions after October of 1965 until they both left Beauval in June of 1967. A conviction is entered on both counts. [94] In summary, convictions were entered on 10 counts and 7 counts were dismissed. [95] In closing, wish to remind all of you that criminal trial must deal with specific facts on specific allegations. [96] This is not broad-ranging inquiry of abuses which may have occurred in the residential school system or even strictly in the Beauval Indian Residential School during the period 1959 to 1967. Much of this has already been done and most of the victims involved in this trial have already been through the other forums and obtained some degree of financial compensation. [97] wish to remind you that criminal trial is not healing process. It is not equipped to heal victims of crimes. [98] Victims can only be healed through their own efforts combined with the understanding, cooperation and assistance of their family and friends, supplemented by efforts of the entire local community. [99] As stated many times herein, criminal trial deals with specific offences and the only question is whether the facts respecting each alleged offence have been proven beyond reasonable doubt. [100] My findings in the verdicts rendered herein are my findings as to the facts that have been proven beyond reasonable doubt.",b_2013skqb395.txt,HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of 10 counts and 7 counts were dismissed.

They separated in October 2004 and were divorced in March 2007.
Their Corollary Relief Judgment incorporated an agreement that the parties would share joint custody of the children and share parenting of the children approximately equally.
The parties also agreed that child support would be based on the difference between what the husband would otherwise pay to the wife for the support of the two children and what the wife would otherwise pay to the husband if the shared custody arrangement did not exist.
Because of the significant discrepancies in their income, the husband agreed to pay to the wife $1,268.00 per month in child support.
In November 2006 the former wife applied to vary child support.
Because of the husband’s increased income, the child support, based on the same formula, was increased $1,506.00 per month.
The former wife now seeks to again increase the level of child support based on the former husband’s increased income and a decline in her income.

Reid for the Crown Greg A. Chovin for the accused SENTENCING DECISION DOVELL J. July 10, 2018 [1] Although Gordon Joseph Fiddler was originally charged with second degree murder with regard to the death of his cousin Tommy Fiddler, on November 3, 2017, the Court found him not guilty of second degree murder but guilty of manslaughter. written decision of November 3, 2017, outlines the Court’s reasons for the verdict of guilty of manslaughter and it is not the intention of the Court to repeat once again all of the reasons for that verdict but only the relevant facts to this sentencing decision. [2] Earlier at the commencement of the trial on July 13, 2017, Gordon Joseph Fiddler pled guilty to possession of firearm while prohibited from doing so. That firearm was the weapon used by Gordon when he fatally shot Tommy once in the head on February 25, 2016, at the Waterhen Lake First Nation. [3] This sentencing decision is with regard to both the manslaughter conviction pursuant to s. 236(a) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46, and his guilty plea to possession of firearm while prohibited from doing so contrary to s. 117.01(1) of the Criminal Code. [4] Since the Court’s November 3, 2017, decision both Crown and defence counsel have changed. The new defence counsel on January 10, 2018, requested stand-alone dedicated Gladue Report (R Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] SCR 688) be prepared by Christine Goodwin which the Court ordered as it was obvious to the Court from the evidence heard during the pre-trial applications and the trial proper that there were numerous Gladue factors that the Court should have further information about during the sentencing stage of this matter. The Court received the very thorough Gladue Report completed by Christine Goodwin on June 1, 2018, and counsel provided the Court with their sentencing submissions on June 8, 2018 referring to multiple, meaningful case law for the consideration of the Court. During the sentencing submissions the Crown presented six victim impact statements of the siblings of the victim Tommy Fiddler; two of his sisters and four of his brothers; collectively marked as Exhibit P12. This matter was adjourned until today’s date for formal sentencing. 2. Sentencing positions of the Crown and defence [5] It is the position of the Crown that global sentence of 15 years is appropriate in this case considering the multiple aggravating factors present including the use of firearm in the death of Tommy Fiddler; Gordon’s serious criminal record including 55 previous convictions 17 of which are for violent offences; Gordon being subject to firearms prohibition at the time of the offence; Gordon rewarding Tommy’s act of kindness in giving Gordon place to live with an act of violence and Gordon’s total lack of remorse. The Crown suggested that in the specific circumstances of this case one year concurrent sentence should be imposed for the possession of firearm while prohibited from doing so. While such charge can be considered by the Court in some cases as “separate and distinct” offence, in the circumstances of this case the Crown’s position was that it was appropriate to sentence Gordon to concurrent sentence to that of manslaughter. The Crown proposed that Gordon be given credit for the remand time he has spent since being arrested on February 25, 2016 at 1.5 to resulting in remand credit of years months as of today’s date. That would result in net global sentence of 11 years and months. [6] The Crown, however, is asking that the Court make an order pursuant to s. 743.6(1) of the Criminal Code which would require Gordon serve one half of his sentence before being eligible for parole or in this case further years 11 months before being eligible for parole if the Court imposed 15 year global sentence. [7] The Crown is also asking that the Court impose DNA order as manslaughter is primary designated offence, lifetime mandatory firearm prohibition pursuant to s. 109 of the Criminal Code order and mandatory weapons forfeiture pursuant to s. 491(1)(a) of the Criminal Code with regard to the weapon used in the offence being Cooey, Model 39, single-shot bolt-action rifle, bearing Serial No. CTO18886. The Crown took no position with regard to the mandatory victim surcharge pursuant to s. 737 of the Criminal Code which would be $400.00 in this case and in default four days to be served. [8] It is the position of the defence that global sentence of eight years is appropriate in this case; the possession of firearm while prohibited from doing so conviction being one year concurrent sentence to an eight year sentence for manslaughter. The defence argued that an eight year sentence is in the mid-range of sentences imposed for manslaughter within the guidelines as provided within Hathway, 2008 SKQB 480 (CanLII), 327 Sask 129 [Hathway], and that this case is not an “exceptional” or “most unusual” offence which called for harsher sentence than was an acceptable sentence for manslaughter in this province. The defence argued that while serious offence, the circumstances of this case did not warrant the 15 year sentence being requested by the Crown. [9] Although Gordon personally wanted enhanced credit for the time he has spent on remand at rate greater than 1.5 to 1, defence counsel agreed that the remand credit being proposed by the Crown at rate of 1.5 to was reasonable. [10] The defence’s position is that it is not necessary or appropriate to impose s. 743.6(1) order in this case. The defence’s position is that the Court should not impose an order pursuant to s. 743.6(1) of the Criminal Code primarily as result of the Court having to recognize the multiple Gladue factors in this case that have to be addressed. To tie the hands of the Correctional Service Canada [CSC] in the handling of Gordon’s programming while in penitentiary addressing his multiple complex needs, the vast majority of which were Gladue related, would be counter-productive and not in anyone’s best interest. The defence suggests to let the CSC do their work without being impeded by the Court’s arbitrary imposition of such an order that would result in Gordon not being eligible for parole until he had served half of his sentence. It is suggested by the defence there may very well be restorative programs available that Gordon would be suitable for that could not be accessed if the Court made such an order. With regard to the ancillary orders being requested the defence did not take position. 3. Criminal Code Provisions [11] consider the following sections of the Criminal Code to be relevant and have taken them into consideration. Manslaughter 236 Every person who commits manslaughter is guilty of an indictable offence and liable (a) where firearm is used in the commission of the offence, to imprisonment for life and to minimum punishment of imprisonment for term of four years; and (b) in any other case, to imprisonment for life. Purpose and Principles of Sentencing Purpose 718 The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to protect society and to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives: (a) to denounce unlawful conduct and the harm done to victims or to the community that is caused by unlawful conduct; (b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences; (c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary; (d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders; (e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and (f) to promote sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims or to the community. Fundamental principle 718.1 sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. Other sentencing principles 718.2 court that imposes sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles: (a) sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (b) sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances; (e) all available sanctions, other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the circumstances and consistent with the harm done to victims or to the community should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders. Power of court to delay parole 743.6 (1) Notwithstanding subsection 120(1) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, where an offender receives, on or after November 1, 1992, sentence of imprisonment of two years or more, including sentence of imprisonment for life imposed otherwise than as minimum punishment, on conviction for an offence set out in Schedule or II to that Act that was prosecuted by way of indictment, the court may, if satisfied, having regard to the circumstances of the commission of the offence and the character and circumstances of the offender, that the expression of society’s denunciation of the offence or the objective of specific or general deterrence so requires, order that the portion of the sentence that must be served before the offender may be released on full parole is one half of the sentence or ten years, whichever is less. 4. The Gladue Report [12] The lengthy Gladue Report as prepared by Christine Goodwin was very helpful to the Court as it focused on Gordon as opposed to general aboriginal background information. In preparing the report Ms. Goodwin contacted eight members of Gordon’s family, Gordon himself and the A/Regional ATIP Liaison of CSC. She reviewed 19 documents and attached appendices to her report. Although it appears she did not have Gordon’s up‑to‑date criminal record she made reference to the information she had about his past criminal record. She identified on the final page of the report proper the following specific background factors to restorative justice considerations in Gordon’s case: Poverty Unstable home/housing Residential school Loss of culture and language Physical abuse Sexual abuse Alcohol and drug abuse Abuser Several children broken family life Criminal record. [13] As previously indicated, it was apparent to the Court during voir dire held with regard to the admissibility of recorded utterances Gordon made while in the police vehicle as he was being transported from Waterhen to the Meadow Lake RCMP detachment there were multiple Gladue factors to be addressed. Within those utterances Gordon disclosed multiple deep-rooted issues he had with “white men”, “the police” and “his community”. Those unresolved issues were also repeated by Gordon during the warned statement he gave to the RCMP at the Meadow Lake RCMP detachment. Gordon’s problems with alcohol and to what extent it had taken over his life were confirmed by his actions both before and after he shot his cousin Tommy on February 25, 2016. It was readily apparent to the Court that Gordon had longstanding unresolved issues regarding his upbringing and was very resentful of his community. These multiple Gladue factors to be addressed by Gordon were confirmed within the Gladue Report prepared by Christine Goodwin. 5. Aggravating and Mitigating Factors [14] There are multiple aggravating factors to be considered by the Court including Gordon’s extensive serious criminal record since 1971. He has 55 convictions on his criminal record; 17 of which are for violent offences. It should be noted, however, that there are several significant gaps in his criminal record; the defence suggesting that those periods reflect times during which Gordon had temporarily overcome his demons with alcohol. Gordon’s use of firearm in the death of his disabled cousin is also very much an aggravating factor as well as the relationship as between Gordon and his cousin at the time of Tommy’s death. Tommy had allowed Gordon and his then partner, Ham, to live in his home as Gordon’s house had recently burned down. As described by the Crown; Tommy’s act of kindness was rewarded by an act of violence on Gordon’s part. It is apparent from the six victim impact statements filed that Tommy’s siblings are still afraid of what might possibly happen to them if Gordon were to ever come back to the reserve. As well, Gordon was on mandatory firearm prohibition at the time of the offence. Notwithstanding that firearm prohibition he willingly accepted firearm from niece to hunt rabbits and prairie chicken. Lastly, Gordon has shown no remorse since he in drunken stupor shot his cousin Tommy in the head for no apparent reason. As previously indicated, after Gordon was arrested and was being taken to the Meadow Lake RCMP Detachment for processing he was recorded while in the police vehicle. As stated at paragraph 23 of the Court’s July 26, 2017 ruling on the voir dire, sampling of what Gordon said during that transport included: [23] All of the completely unsolicited statements made by Gordon during that one hour thirty-three minute audio recording can only be described as belligerent “vulgar rant” regarding his personal views of white men being rapists and pedophiles. Certain parts of his statements include what can be possibly interpreted as his daring the RCMP members to kill him. Such utterances as “Kill me. Shoot me today, you fuckers. I’ll dare you. don’t care. I’ll die for it.” And at page of the transcript of that indecent rant on the recording Gordon says: ... Fuck you guys. Fuck you goddamn white man and your system. Fuck that [unintelligible]. Fuckin’ fat bastard. killed him and loved it. killed him and I’ll kill him again. [unintelligible] kill him and killed him. [15] When asked as to whether or not he had anything to say before the Court sentenced him Gordon’s only concerns were that he had never had bail hearing, that the prosecutor who had conducted the trial had not bothered to show up for sentencing submissions and that he wanted to make it clear that there was no deliberation on his part to shoot Tommy. There was no mention of his being remorseful for the death of his cousin Tommy. The Crown’s position was that Gordon acting out potential “accident” defence during his warned statement was an indication that he was not remorseful for what he had done but was just trying to make up an excuse for what had happened. [16] On the other hand there is one huge mitigating factor and that is the multiple Gladue factors relevant to Gordon taken as a whole. Both of his parents attended residential schools. At the age of years old Gordon was also sent to residential school where he remained until he was 12 years old. While at the Beauval Indian Residential School Gordon was physically and sexually abused. Gordon’s cousin Sidney witnessed the atrocities that Gordon suffered while at the residential school. When Gordon returned home to Waterhen Gordon’s life spiraled out of control, he turning to drugs and alcohol. According to Gordon’s criminal record he then began criminal activities that would see him incarcerated for many years during his life. [17] Gordon has been chronic alcoholic for 50 years or since he was 14 years of age. On the date of sentencing submissions Gordon turned 65 an age when most people are thinking about retirement; Gordon is thinking about his foreseeable future being in federal penitentiary. [18] The Alberta Court of Appeal in LaBerge, 1995 ABCA 196 (CanLII), 165 AR 375, outlined number of factors court may want to consider in determining fit sentence for manslaughter. Those factors, although certainly not exhaustive, include characterization of the act itself, the choice of weapon used in the offence, the degree of force the offender used to perpetrate the act, the extent of the victim’s injuries, the degree of violence or brutality involved, the existence of any gratuitous violence, the degree of deliberation involved in the act, the extent to which the act reflects forethought or planning, the complexity of the act, what provoked the act, if anything, and the time that was taken to perpetrate the act. In other words, although not exclusive to manslaughter sentencing, the specifics of the offence, the victim and the offender must be carefully considered by the Court in considering an appropriate sentence for manslaughter as the circumstances of the offence of manslaughter are very diverse. [19] As stated by this Court in Hathway at paragraph 33: 33 The offence of manslaughter is unique offence in Canadian criminal jurisprudence in that it covers very broad spectrum of circumstances, all of which are characterized as possessing the criminal culpability required for the commission of the offence of manslaughter. The spectrum reflects the endless combination of circumstances which may give rise to the offence and ultimately, is an offence which for the purpose of sentencing, requires thorough analysis of the existing sentence precedents, the circumstances of the offence and the circumstances of the offender. And at paragraph 36 the Court concluded: 36 In considering the relevant decisions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal and various decisions of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen’s Bench which have not been subject to appeal, have concluded that the appropriate range of sentencing for the offence of manslaughter in the Province of Saskatchewan is between four years and 12 years. There are isolated instances of sentences less than four years, and sentences greater than 12 years, however they are indeed exceptional, and in my view, sentence falling outside of the range of four years to 12 years ought to occur only in the most unusual, exceptional or extenuating of circumstances. distillation of the sentencing principles articulated in ss. 718, 718.1 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code, along with the circumstances of the offence and the circumstances of the offender, will result in the vast majority of instances, in sentence falling within this range. [20] In considering the range of sentences available for the offence of manslaughter this Court has also considered the comments of our Court of Appeal in Keepness, 2010 SKCA 69 (CanLII) at para 29, 359 Sask 34: 29 agree with this general review of the law, except for one refinement. The judge in Hathway describes sentences that fall outside the range as being “exceptional” or occurring “only in the most unusual, exceptional or extenuating circumstances.” As has been indicated, review of the case law bears out the statement that there is usual range for manslaughter at least for manslaughters involving brutality and alcohol or drugs from four to 12 years, but it overstates the matter to conclude that departures from range occur in the most unusual or exceptional circumstances only. This language may lead judge to conclude incorrectly that the lower and upper limits of the range are more fixed than they are, or that they are to be departed from in only the rarest of cases. No matter how one tries to delimit the type of case for which the range for manslaughter is being set, the description will remain nebulous and the circumstances variable. Correct application of the principles of sentencing should mean there are fewer sentences falling outside the range for manslaughter than within it, but in the exercise of their discretion, judges may depart, without introducing disparity, where the circumstances of the case are beyond those customarily found at the lower or upper ends of the range. [21] In this case there had been no fight, argument or violence between Tommy and Gordon before Tommy was shot by Gordon. As stated in paragraph 18 of the Court’s November 3, 2017 decision the facts of this case are not complex. [18] Ham assisted Gordon up the ramp, and after they entered the house, Gordon went straight to his bedroom with what was left of his case of Pilsner beer, muttering and babbling something in Cree to Tommy as he passed him in the living room. Michael and Tommy were sitting at table playing cards in the living room. Gordon made comment in Cree to Tommy as he passed him, “your mother had told me that you murdered your brother.” Ham went directly to the kitchen and tended to pot on the stove. Within moments, Gordon came back out from the bedroom and once again said to Tommy in Cree the same thing about Tommy’s mother having told him that Tommy was responsible for the death of his brother, Rocky. Tommy in Cree replied to Gordon “not to believe everything you hear,” after which Gordon pointed the gun at Tommy and shot him in the head and more specifically his right temple area. [22] While in severely drunken state Gordon shot Tommy once in the right temple area. Tommy died instantly. Gordon did not try to get away but just went back to his bedroom and fell asleep in his drunken stupor until the RCMP arrived and arrested him. accept that there was no forethought or planning on Gordon’s part in the shooting of Tommy. It happened very quickly and from all accounts from the eye witnesses in Tommy’s residence at the time this crime was totally senseless. [23] Although the Crown provided the Court with multiple cases, the Crown is relying primarily upon three cases: Hathway Ross, 2006 SKCA (SentDig) 16 [Ross] Stonechild, 2017 SKQB 138 (CanLII) [Stonechild] in support of its request for 15 year global sentence with no parole eligibility until Gordon has served half of that sentence pursuant to s. 743.6(1) of the Criminal Code. [24] The Court in sentencing an individual for any offence must sentence that specific person for the specific offence he or she has committed in the unique circumstances of that offence. There is no such thing as “simple” sentencing. Each sentencing takes on life of its own. [25] Amongst the multiple principles of sentencing is the provision of s. 718.2 of the Criminal Code which states that the sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances. It is thus important that the Court review all of the cases provided to it by counsel but, in particular, the three cases the Crown is primarily relying upon in support of its position that 15 year sentence is appropriate in this case. [26] In Hathway the accused, age 49, pled guilty to manslaughter. He had an extensive criminal record including 57 prior convictions of which were for violent offences. The victim was his 84-year-old landlord who suffered 10 stab wounds, the most serious being the severing of his left jugular vein. That tragically resulted in the landlord bleeding to death. At the time of the offence the accused was intoxicated by alcohol and/or drugs and his attack on his landlord displayed sustained attack on vulnerable person. The accused was sentenced to 11.5 years less credit for his remand time of 7.5 years resulting in net sentence of years’ imprisonment. [27] There were no Gladue factors to be considered as Mr. Hathway was not aboriginal. [28] In Ross the accused was 54 years of age. joint submission by the defence and Crown was presented to the Court of 10 years with the provision that he must serve years before being eligible for parole. The Court of Appeal dismissed the sentence appeal. The accused, who was drinking heavily at the time, shot the victim and the victim was killed instantly. The criminal record of the accused included three firearm charges and two alcohol offences, however, there was gap in his record from 1994 to 2006. The accused was not aboriginal and thus the Gladue factors were not consideration of the Court. [29] In Stonechild the 58-year-old accused was charged with second degree murder. jury returned verdict of manslaughter. He had lengthy criminal record including 63 convictions; of which were for violence. The victim was 84 years of age with mobility issues and was unable to defend himself. The victim had extended hospitality to the accused who in drunken “spur of the moment” event killed the victim who sustained minimum of 20 lacerations, all of which were consistent with his having been struck with his own cane. number of these blows were delivered to the victim’s face, some with sufficient force that both eyes were essentially destroyed, with one eye almost entirely displaced from its orbit. The victim was also stabbed with knife 14 times, with 12 knife wounds to his chest and to his abdomen. There were two additional stab wounds to the abdomen, apparently inflicted by screwdriver. There were multiple Gladue factors that the Court considered in sentencing the accused ultimately to 15 years. [30] Defence counsel provided the Court with six cases, of which two were manslaughter cases which resulted in sentences of four and one-half years and eight years. Although defence counsel indicated he was not intending to rely specifically on any of these cases, the cases were provided for the Court’s assistance only. [31] The Court has also considered the other case law as provided to it by counsel which resulted in sentences for manslaughter ranging from 1/2 years to 15 years. [32] At this juncture what the Court must decide is where within this spectrum of case law Gordon Fiddler fits in. Having considered all of the purposes and principles of sentencing as outlined in ss. 718, 718.1 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code including the totality principle and the Gladue factors the Court has determined that a global sentence of 10 years is appropriate in this case to be served in a federal institution on the manslaughter conviction. [33] Although s. 117.01(1) of the Criminal Code conviction has sometimes been treated by the courts as “separate and distinct” offence, in the circumstances of this case and as agreed by counsel for the Crown and defence the Court is prepared to impose concurrent sentence of one year to the ten year sentence the Court has imposed for the manslaughter conviction. [34] As agreed by counsel for the Crown and defence Gordon shall be given credit of three years, seven months pursuant to s. 719 of the Criminal Code for the time he has spent on remand since being arrested on February 25, 2016 to today’s date at the rate of 1.5 to 1. That results in net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in federal penitentiary. [35] The Court must lastly determine as to whether it is appropriate to make an order pursuant to section 743.6 of the Criminal Code. That section provides: Power of court to delay parole 743.6 (1) Notwithstanding subsection 120(1) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, where an offender receives, on or after November 1, 1992, sentence of imprisonment of two years or more, including sentence of imprisonment for life imposed otherwise than as minimum punishment, on conviction for an offence set out in Schedule or II to that Act that was prosecuted by way of indictment, the court may, if satisfied, having regard to the circumstances of the commission of the offence and the character and circumstances of the offender, that the expression of society’s denunciation of the offence or the objective of specific or general deterrence so requires, order that the portion of the sentence that must be served before the offender may be released on full parole is one half of the sentence or ten years, whichever is less. [36] The guiding principles are outlined in ss. (2) of s. 743.6 of the Criminal Code. Those guiding principles are expressed as “... the paramount principles which are to guide the court under this section are denunciation and specific or general deterrence, with rehabilitation of the offender, in all cases, being subordinate to these paramount principles”. [37] Although the Crown provided the Court with no case law in support of its request for an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Criminal Code the Court is familiar with Zinck, 2003 SCC (CanLII), [2003] SCR 41 [Zinck]. Zinck held that the Crown must demonstrate foundation for such additional rigour in the sentencing of the offender. Specific relevant paragraphs of Zinck include: 30 The position of s. 743.6 in the Criminal Code signals that it should not be applied in routine manner. The power should not be exercised in mechanical or automatic way, nor invoked in connection with every jail term imposed for an offence covered by s. 743.6. The judge must once again apply the sentencing factors. And at paragraph 31: 31 the court must arrive at its conclusion as to whether this additional punishment is required. The prosecution has the burden of demonstrating that it is. The judge must satisfy himself or herself that the order is needed to reflect the objectives of sentencing, with awareness of the special weight ascribed by Parliament to the social imperatives of denunciation and deterrence. And lastly at paragraph 33: 33 The decision to delay parole remains out of the ordinary, but may and should be taken if, after the proper weighing of all factors, it appears to be required in order to impose form of punishment which is completely appropriate in the circumstances of the case. [38] The Court has concluded that it is not appropriate in this case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Criminal Code. Denunciation and deterrence have already been figured prominently in my analysis in determining that a 10 year global sentence is appropriate in this case. There is thus no need for an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Criminal Code. The guiding factors as contained within s. 743.6 order have already been dealt with through the initial sentencing analysis. As stated by Justice Wilkinson in Smith, 2008 SKCA 20 (CanLII) at para 73, 307 Sask 45: 73 Section 743.6 has, on occasion, been scorned as the indiscriminate infliction of harsh punishment, the judicial application of salt to open wounds. It can, nonetheless, serve as companion piece in the sentencing process and as counterpoint, if necessary, when societal interests outweigh those of the individual, and rehabilitation, as sentencing objective, has been given legislative back seat. Conclusion [39] For all the reasons as outlined in this decision I have concluded that as to the manslaughter conviction a sentence of 10 years in a federal institution is an appropriate sentence in the circumstances of this specific case. Credit needs to be given to Gordon for the time he has spent on remand since being arrested on February 25, 2016, to date pursuant to s. 719 of the Criminal Code. At the rate of 1.5 to 1 credit is to be given of three years, seven months. Gordon Fiddler shall therefore serve an additional six years, five months in a federal penitentiary with regard to the manslaughter conviction. [40] As to Count No. 2 on the Direct Indictment being the possession of a firearm while he was prohibited from doing so contrary to s. 117.01(1) of the Criminal Code I sentence Gordon Fiddler to a concurrent sentence of one year. [41] The Court is not prepared to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6(1) of the Criminal Code as the Court is not satisfied that it would be appropriate in Gordon Fiddler’s specific circumstances including the multiple Gladue factors to be considered and addressed in this case not only by the Court but CSC. Denunciation and deterrence have already been adequately considered by the Court and have concluded that it would not be appropriate to make such an order in this case. [42] direct the following ancillary orders: (a) Pursuant to s. 487.051 of the Criminal Code, that sample of bodily substances be taken from Gordon Fiddler that is reasonably required for the purpose of forensic DNA analysis; (b) Pursuant to s. 109 of the Criminal Code, that Gordon Fiddler be prohibited from possessing any firearm, crossbow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition and explosive substance for life; (c) Pursuant to s. 114 of the Criminal Code, that Gordon Fiddler surrender to peace officer any firearm, crossbow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition and explosive substance and any authorization, license and registration certificate for the same within 14 days of this decision; (d) Pursuant to s. 491 of the Criminal Code, the Cooey, Model 39, single-shot bolt-action rifle, bearing Serial No. CTO18886 seized in the investigation of this offence is forfeited to Her Majesty and shall be disposed of as the Attorney General directs; and (e) The victim surcharge to be imposed pursuant to s. 737 of the Criminal Code in the amount of $400.00 shall be payable forthwith and in default of payment four days to be served consecutive to the sentence imposed today.

BLACK and KRUPP MaK MASCHINENBAU GmbH body corporate, and KRUPP MaK DIESEL INC., body corporate Respondents the appellant appeared in person Thomas M. MacDonald for the Respondent Appeal Heard: October 9, 1996 Judgment Delivered: October 22, 1996 THE COURT: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondents in the amount of $1500.00 inclusive of disbursements per reasons for judgment of Bateman, J.A.; Freeman and Flinn, JJ.A. concurring. BATEMAN, J.A.: Mr. Black appeals the Order of Justice Michael MacDonald of the Supreme Court dated April 30, 1996, dismissing a motion to strike the plaintiffs' (respondents') Originating Notice and Statement of Claim. Background: The respondent companies claim that they are creditors of bankrupt company, NsC Diesel Power Inc. The appellant was the shareholder, chief officer and controlling mind of that company. On August 10, 1994, Associate Chief Justice Palmeter granted an Order (issued September 7, 1994) pursuant to s. 38 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, as amended. That Order was granted upon the motion of the respondents herein (Krupp) who sought leave of the court to initiate an action against the appellant, as is required by s. 38. The appellant unsuccessfully applied for an Order of this court declaring the s. 38 Order, along with other Orders granted by Palmeter, A.C.J., ""nullity"". The decision of Pugsley, J.A., in Chambers, on this issue, is dated October 26, 1994. The appellant by way of application purported to appeal that decision to the Chief Justice, who, by decision dated November 24, 1994, dismissed the application. On September 28, 1995, the respondents commenced the action in the Supreme Court against the appellant, seeking, inter alia, damages for the appellant's alleged fraudulent actions as the controlling mind of NsC Diesel Power Incorporated. Justice Michael MacDonald was assigned to case manage that action. By Originating Notice (Application) dated January 9, 1996, Mr. Black applied to the Court for an Order declaring that Associate Chief Justice Palmeter was without jurisdiction to grant the s. 38 Order; that the respondents' action be dismissed or stayed in that Nova Scotia is not the forum conveniens; and that the action should be dismissed as the Nova Scotia courts are not impartial. That application was heard by the case management judge. In decision dated February 9, 1996, Justice MacDonald found that the Order of Palmeter, A.C.J. remained valid Order of the Supreme Court. He declined to dismiss or stay the proceeding, as the balance of convenience strongly favoured the continuance of the action in Nova Scotia. He found, as well, that there was no material before him demonstrating bias or to support reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of Nova Scotia judges. Mr. Black's application was dismissed. It is from that Order that Mr. Black appeals. Issues: The appellant states the following grounds of appeal: 1. THAT the learned Chambers Judge erred in law, insofar as he failed to consider and apply the provisions of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 as amended, sec. 38 to the facts of the cases; and failed to consider the prejudicial and damaging effects of the order sought to be rescinded; 2. THAT the learned Chambers Judge erred in law, insofar as he failed to consider matters respecting the roles, and the rights, of the applicant as defined in the Constitution Act, 1982 R.S.C. 1985, c. 11 (U.K.), specifically s. 1., 7., 15. (1), 24(1), 32(1)(a) (b), and 52.(1) and the Canadian Bill of Rights, and specifically s. 1(a) 2(d); 3. THAT the learned Chambers Judge failed to remove himself as he was unable to act in an impartial and unbiased judicial man (sic) 4. THAT the learned Chambers Judge erred in law, insofar as he failed to consider evidence in the file. He seeks the following relief: 1. THAT the Decision of Justice MacDonald be reversed and an order granted rescinding the Order of the Court in Bankruptcy dated September 7, 1994 and striking the plaintiffs' originating notice and statement of claims in action S.H. No. 120859; 2. THAT the Court award costs, of the motions in the Courts below and on appeal, to the appellant payable forthwith; Mr. Black has not appealed Justice MacDonald's finding that Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens. Grounds 2, and are argued in the context of the allegations of bias and failure to consider the evidence. The issues on this appeal are, therefore, the challenge to the s. 38 Order; the allegations of bias; and the judge's, alleged, failure to consider the evidence. Analysis: (i) Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act s. 38 Order: Section 38(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. B-3, provides: (1) Where creditor requests the trustee to take any proceeding that in his opinion would be for the benefit of the estate of bankrupt and the trustee refuses or neglects to take the proceeding, the creditor may obtain from the court an order authorizing him to take the proceeding in his own name and at his own expense and risk, on notice being given the other creditors of the contemplated proceeding, and on such other terms and conditions as the court may direct. creditor is ""a person having claim, preferred, secured or unsecured, provable as claim under"" the Act. It was Mr. Black's submission before MacDonald, J. that Chief Justice Palmeter was without jurisdiction to issue the s. 38 Order because the respondents are not ""creditors"" of the bankrupt company, NsC Diesel Power Incorporated, a status essential to the granting of the Order. The threshold issue before us is whether MacDonald, J. had jurisdiction, in the proceeding before him, to strike the respondents' Statement of Claim on the basis that, as submitted by Mr. Black, Palmeter, A.C.J. was wrong in granting the s. 38 Order. Mr. Black, on this jurisdictional issue, submits that MacDonald, J. wrongly refused to exercise jurisdiction or, alternatively, that he did exercise jurisdiction, in that he reviewed, in a limited way, the merits of the decision of Palmeter, A.C.J., but erred in the result. A review of the transcripts of the pre-hearing conference and of the hearing reveals that MacDonald, J. was of the firm view that he did not, in the context of the application before him, have jurisdiction to review the s. 38 Order. Mr. Black, however, insisted upon advancing this argument in his submissions to the judge. MacDonald, J. wrote in his decision: At the Section 38 hearing, Palmeter, A.C.J. had before him affidavit evidence confirming that the plaintiffs were creditors of the bankrupt estate. The plaintiffs' request for standing was supported by the trustee. The defendant has applied to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, without success, to have Palmeter, A.C.J.'s order declared nullity. It remains valid order of this Court. As such, this Court has jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs' claim. This aspect of the defendant's application, therefore, fails. (emphasis added) Mr. Black submits that the above passage confirms that MacDonald, J., notwithstanding the reservations he expressed, did assume jurisdiction to review the Order of Palmeter, A.C.J. and in so doing should have received and considered the substantial volume of material submitted by Mr. Black on the issue of whether Krupp was creditor of NsC Diesel. He further submits that MacDonald, J. was clearly wrong when or if he concluded that prima facie case that Krupp was creditor had been made out before Palmeter, A.C.J. disagree with the interpretation Mr. Black places upon the remarks of MacDonald, J. The judge did no more than confirm that the Order of Palmeter, A.C.J., not having been declared nullity in this court in the proceeding before Pugsley, J.A., remained valid court Order. In the alternative, even should we accept Mr. Black's submission that MacDonald, J. assumed jurisdiction, with which submission disagree, we must nevertheless consider whether he had such jurisdiction. If he did not have jurisdiction to review the s. 38 Order, he was correct in not receiving the evidence purportedly impugning its validity. The record confirms that Justice MacDonald was correct when he noted that Associate Chief Justice Palmeter had before him evidence that the respondents were creditors of the bankrupt estate. In particular, Axel Kettmann of Hamburg Germany, lawyer employed by the respondents, in paragraph of his Affidavit of June 21, 1994, deposes that the respondents Krupp ""are creditors of the estate of the bankrupt NsC Diesel Power Incorporated and have filed Proofs of Claim together with supporting documentation with respect to the bankruptcy"". This evidence was unchallenged. Indeed, the trustee in bankruptcy supported the respondents' s. 38 application. Mr. Black's submission that there was no evidence before Palmeter, A.C.J. that Krupp were creditors of the bankrupt estate is in error. Mr. Black's complaint is therefore restricted to the sufficiency and reliability of that evidence. He wished to have an opportunity, in the proceeding before MacDonald, J., to attack the evidence of Axel Kettman and tender contrary evidence. It is settled law that an affected party, here Mr. Black, has no standing in s. 38 application. The transcript of the proceeding before Palmeter, A.C.J., reveals that, while Mr. Black did not have standing on that motion, he was permitted to appear and make limited representations. He asserted, as he did here and before MacDonald, J., that there was no evidence that the respondents were creditors of the bankrupt estate. There was discussion on that issue with representations on behalf of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy as well as the solicitor for the respondents. The judge was satisfied that prima facie case had been made out. All of this is, however, irrelevant to the question of the jurisdiction of MacDonald, J. to review the s. 38 Order. In support of his position that Justice MacDonald possessed jurisdiction to review the Order, Mr. Black has cited Toyota Canada Inc. v. Imperial Richmond Holdings Ltd. (1993), 10 AIta.L.R. (3d) 127 (Q.B.). In that case, which is not binding upon this court, the judge who had granted s. 38 Order ruled that the affected party, had standing to appear before him to challenge the Order on the basis of alleged procedural irregularities. The situation before this court is not analogous. Mr. Black is seeking to challenge the finding of fact by Palmeter, A.C.J., that, for the purposes of the s. 38 application, the respondents are creditors of the bankrupt estate. factual finding is distinct from procedural irregularity. Had there been no evidence before Palmeter, A.C.J. that the respondents were creditors of the bankrupt estate, then there may have been procedural error in the granting of the Order and we would have to consider whether the Toyota case applied, so as to give Mr. Black standing to challenge the s. 38 Order and, if so, in what form of proceeding that challenge could be made. Mr. Black cites, as well, B.N.R. Holdings Ltd. v. Royal Bank (1992), 1992 CanLII 1093 (BC CA), 16 C.B.R. (3d) 72 (B.C.C.A.). In that case an action was commenced by creditors of the undischarged bankrupt company, without benefit of s. 38 Order, long after the trustee had been discharged and the company struck from the register of companies. Six years after the commencement of the action the defendant applied for dismissal of the proceeding for want of prosecution or, in the alternative, to have the statement of claim struck. After various interim applications, the chambers judge, inter alia, ordered that the trustee be reappointed and granted an Order pursuant to s. 38 permitting the creditors to bring the action. The issue before the court of appeal was whether leave pursuant to s. 38 could be granted nunc pro tunc. The court held that, as no cause of action existed until leave of the court was granted, the existing action could not be authorized retrospectively. Mr. Black is of the view that in this case the Court of Appeal assumed the jurisdiction to review the s. 38 Order of the chambers judge and, thus, we have jurisdiction to review the s. 38 Order, as did MacDonald, J. B.N.R. is not analogous to the situation before us. In B.N.R. the chambers judge was granting an original s. 38 Order, not reviewing his own Order or that of another judge. The Court of Appeal was not reviewing whether the conditions precedent to the granting of s. 38 Order had been met nor the validity of the s. 38 Order, per se, but, rather, determining whether an action, commenced without leave could be retrospectively revived. B.N.R. does not bear upon the jurisdiction of MacDonald, J. to review the s. 38 Order. Mr. Black refers, as well, to Construction Co. v. Reid (1985), 1985 CanLII 616 (BC SC), 56 C.B.R. (N.S.) 232 (B.C.S.C.). There the chambers judge held that the defendants, in an action commenced by creditors pursuant to an Order under s. 20 of the Bankruptcy Act, did have status to bring an action for declaration that the proceedings were nullity and void ab initio on the ground that the proceedings were authorized by an Order of the registrar rather than by an Order of judge of the bankruptcy court. Again, this case is unhelpful to Mr. Black. There is distinction between an application challenging an action on the basis that it is nullity, due to failure to meet mandatory statutory conditions, and challenge to the factual findings made by judge in the process of granting the Order. Indeed, in Paris, J. wrote at p. 5: Finally, objection is taken that the material before the registrar was inadequate to justify the making of the order. It is questionable in my mind to what extent judge in my position can review the decision of the court or registrar authorizing the proceedings. But, in any event, there was before the registrar clear, uncontradicted allegation, under oath, of fraudulent preference and dispositions by the bankrupt in favour of the defendants. In my view, that was certainly sufficient to warrant an order. (emphasis added) Mr. Black cited Toronto Dominion Bank v. Alex L. Clark Limited (1992), 22 C.B.R. (3d) (O.C.J.,Gen.Div.). There an applicant for s. 38 Order failed to satisfy the judge of his status as creditor. That case is relevant only to the question of the sufficiency of the evidence before the judge on the s. 38 application. It is not helpful on the issue of MacDonald, J.'s jurisdiction to review the Order. In short, none of the authorities put forward by Mr. Black are supportive of his position. Re Coroban Plastics Ltd. (1994), 1994 CanLII 1135 (BC CA), 34 C.B.R. (3d) 50 (B.C.C.A., in Chambers) is, in my view, dispositive of this issue. There, the affected party sought leave to appeal the granting of s. 38 Order. After thorough review of the authorities, Taylor, J.A. wrote at p. 54: These decisions, taken together, seem to me to establish clearly that on s. 38 application, such as that which resulted in the present order, neither the bankrupt nor any other proposed defendant in the intended action has right either to notice or to be heard on the application, and that neither the bankrupt nor any other proposed defendant will have standing to appeal any order made on such an application, provided that it goes no further than to authorize action to be brought this being for the reason that their rights will not be affected by s. 38 order so long as it goes no further than that. The effect of the order is to transfer from trustee to creditor whatever right of action may exist much, no doubt, as chose in action may be contractually transferred from one party to another, without adversely affecting the debtor. The order in this case imposes no liability on the appellant which did not previously exist, and leaves it free to assert in the action every defence it ever had. (emphasis added) And at p.55: After hearing the application invited the assistance of counsel with respect to two decisions, Wilson v. The Queen, 1983 CanLII 35 (SCC), [1983] S.C.R. 594, and Caisse Populaire Vanier Ltée v. Bales (1991), 1991 CanLII 7294 (ON SC), O.R. (3d) 456 (Gen. Div.), which were not referred to in argument. am obliged to them for their written responses to this request. Wilson v. The Queen sets out the principle that, absent fraud or new evidence, it is not possible to attack an order in proceedings other than those whose specific purpose is the reversal, variation or nullification of that order. In Caisse Populaire Vanier Ltée v. Bales it was held that challenging the validity of s. 38 order in the proceeding commenced pursuant to the order would amount to such collateral attack, and is therefore impermissible. (emphasis added) The appellant's attempt to challenge the validity of the s. 38 Order, in the proceeding before MacDonald, J. was a collateral attack. His application could therefore not succeed. Section 187(5) provides procedure for limited review of an Order granted pursuant to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The subsection permits court to ""review, rescind or vary any Order made by it under its bankruptcy jurisdiction"". would make no finding as to whether non-party to the s. 38 proceeding can seek review under this section. Taylor, J.A., remarked in Coroban, supra, at p. 55, ""such provision cannot invoke any wider test for standing than would otherwise apply"". Suffice to say, the application before MacDonald, J. was not made pursuant to s. 187(5). It is Civil Procedure Rule 14.25 that governs the striking of Statement of Claim. Mr. Black's application before MacDonald, J. was not made pursuant to this Rule, which provides: 14.25 (1) The court may at any stage of proceeding order any pleading, affidavit or statement of facts, or anything therein, to be struck out or amended on the ground that, (a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence; (b) it is false, scandalous, frivolous or vexatious; (c) it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the proceeding; (d) it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the court; and may order the proceeding to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly. (2) Unless the court otherwise orders, no evidence shall be admissible by affidavit or otherwise on an application under paragraph (1)(a). As was held by this court in Sherman v. Giles (1994), 1994 CanLII 3964 (NS CA), 137 N.S.R. (2d) 52, affidavit evidence is not admissible to prove or disprove allegations of fact in an application to strike pursuant to this Rule. It was confirmed in that case that the allegations of fact, as set out in the Statement of Claim, must be taken to be true. The Statement of Claim asserted that the respondents are creditors of the bankrupt estate. Had Mr. Black advanced his application under this Rule, which, in any event he did not, he could not have succeeded. Accordingly, I would find that this ground of appeal fails. (ii) Bias: In addition to the claim that was before MacDonald, J., that the courts in Nova Scotia are biased in this matter, the appellant alleges on this appeal, that MacDonald, J. acted with bias in his handling of the application. This latter allegation is set out at paragraphs 42 and 43 of Mr. Black's factum: It is respectfully submitted that Justice MacDonald did not wish to have to deal with the jurisdiction and the correctness of the Order of Palmeter ACJ., as the Associate Chief Justice is and was responsible for the duties as assigned to the Associate Chief Justice by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court being ""...the assignment of judicial duties."" and both the Chief Justice and the Associate Chief Justice had precedence over Justice MacDonald. It is respectfully submitted that Justice MacDonald, when he knew that the correctness of the Order of Palmeter ACJ. would be tested on the Application to be heard on February 9, 1996, should have removed himself as he would not be able to deal with the application in an impartial and unbiased manner without personal prejudice to himself in the pursuit of his own judicial career. Mr. Black submits that MacDonald, J. was aware that Palmeter, A.C.J., did not have evidence before him that Krupp was creditor, therefore one is inevitably led to the conclusion that MacDonald, J. could only have refused to overturn the s. 38 Order because he feared repercussions. This allegation is preposterous and completely unsupported by the record. There was evidence before Palmeter, A.C.J. that the respondents were creditors. MacDonald, J. did not have jurisdiction to review the s. 38 Order. There is nothing in the extensive record before this court to indicate that MacDonald, J. acted other than in an impartial and fair manner in considering the application before him. On the issue of bias in the Nova Scotia courts, generally, MacDonald, J. was correct in his finding that the appellant's submission before him had no merit. I would dismiss this ground of appeal. (iii) Failure to Consider the Evidence: Mr. Black further alleges that MacDonald, J. erred in that he failed to consider the evidence before him. It was the appellant's view that his evidence was compelling and determinative. That the trial judge was of different view, however, does not lead to the conclusion that he did not consider the evidence. Having reviewed the record to the extent necessary, am satisfied that MacDonald, J. properly considered the admissible and relevant evidence before him. As he did not have jurisdiction to review the s. 38 Order, he was correct in limiting the evidence submitted by Mr. Black to the degree that he did. I would dismiss this ground of appeal. Fresh Evidence: Mr. Black sought to tender fresh evidence at the hearing in the form of an Affidavit of several persons which he maintains is relevant to the relationship between the trustee of the bankrupt NsC Diesel and Krupp and to the status of Krupp as creditor. In view of my finding that MacDonald, J. did not have jurisdiction to review the s. 38 Order, the affidavit is not relevant to an issue before us. It is thus unnecessary to determine if it meets the stringent test for the receipt of fresh evidence as set out in Thies v. Thies (1992), 1992 CanLII 2590 (NS CA), 110 N.S.R. (2d) 177 (N.S.C.A.). The affidavit should not be received. Disposition: I would dismiss the appeal with costs to the respondents in the amount of $1500.00 inclusive of disbursements. Bateman, J.A.

In March of 2012, the Director, acting as the agent of Mr. Newell’s landlord, applied for an order terminating Mr. Newell’s tenancy pursuant to ss.
68 and 70 of The Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, S.S. 2006, c. R-22.0001, on the grounds that Mr. Newell was trafficking drugs.
[5] The Residential Tenancies Act hearing officer determined that Mr. Newell was more likely than not trafficking in marihuana but found the evidence insufficient to make a determination that Mr. Newell was trafficking from the house.
There was no appeal filed by the Director.

PLEMEL, [1] The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant applied substance in the back alley next to his property which caused damage to his lawn in the Town of Wadena. report by Back-Track Investigations and Special Services Ltd. (Back-Track), filed in these proceedings as Exhibit P-1, supports Mr. Charbonneau’s belief that damage which occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of substance from the back alley. Mr. Charbonneau claims damages in the amount of $9,903.98 together with pre-judgment interest as well as the cost of issuing and serving the summons. [2] The Plaintiff must prove his claim on balance of probabilities. Besides filing the report just mentioned he and his wife, Sandra Charbonneau, both testified. He also called licenced pesticide operator named David Panasiuk, town employee named Brian Hayes and Patrick Frith, the professional agrologist who prepared the report for Back-Track. Mr. Statchuk testified in his own defence. [3] Having read the report and having heard the evidence of Patrick Frith, am satisfied on balance of probabilities that substance, either through run-off or leaching from the back alley got into the Charbonneau’s lawn and killed it. Photographs, as well as the evidence given by Wendell and Sandra Charbonneau and David Panasiuk, further support this finding. However, I am not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that Mr. Statchuk had anything to do with putting the substance into the back alley or that it came from the Statchuk property. [4] There are valid reasons for Mr. and Mrs. Charbonneaus’ suspicions. Mr. Statchuk has access to farm chemicals through his employment with Crop Production Services and formerly with Viterra. Sandra Charbonneau saw him dump liquid in the back alley. Mr. Charbonneau spoke with him and he stated that he has used glyphosate and Ally and may have mixed one little strong. Both are chemicals used in weed control. The Statchuk yard is directly across the back alley from the Charbonneau’s. Plant life has been killed only in the Charbonneau yard, but not in the yards to their right or left. The back alley slopes from the Statchuk yard toward the Charbonneau yard. [5] While the Charbonneaus’ suspicions are certainly not frivolous, the evidence does not meet the test of proof on balance of probabilities. The Plaintiff’s own witness, Mr. Frith, is Professional Agrologist with Bachelor of Science Degree in Crop Science. He was qualified as an expert in this case to give opinion evidence in the area of plant chemicals including how they are to be used and their effects on lawns and gardens. This included the effects of run-off and leaching. His evidence is that it is unlikely that glyphosate or Ally killed the lawn but that soil sterilant was probably to blame. There is no evidence that Mr. Statchuk used soil sterilant in his yard or in the back alley. [6] Mr. Statchuk testified that he last used Ally in his yard to control broad leaf plants in 2010. He last used glyphosate around his yard in 2012. accept Mr. Frith’s evidence that Ally could not have caused the damage in question. Where the evidence of David Panasiuk and Mr. Frith conflict on this point, accept the evidence of Mr. Frith due to his level of expertise. Ally kills broad leaf plants but not grass. also accept Mr. Frith’s evidence that if glyphosate entered the Charbonneau’s yard either by leaching or run-off, residue of glyphosate should have been found in the soil samples taken and analyzed for that particular chemical. None was found. Furthermore, glyphosate is not soil sterilant but herbicide. Some plant life would be expected to have emerged in the time frame discussed in evidence. [7] The pattern of dead lawn has the characteristics of soil sterilant getting into the lawn from run-off or leaching. Mr. Statchuk has access to soil sterilants through his employment but he testified he did not use them in his yard or in the back alley. There is no growth on Mr. Statchuk’s side of the alley but this is consistent the Defendant’s testimony that he manually removed weeds and also used glyphosate. There was suggestion that perhaps shed he moved from the Viterra work site may have contained substance which leaked out, into the back alley and into the Charbonneau’s yard. However, the evidence does not support that. In preceding years, before it was moved to the Statchuk yard, it was used to store tools, machinery and applicators. Mr. Statchuk had the floor in it replaced before moving it to his yard. [8] Mr. Statchuk states that on occasion he washed windshields of his vehicles and emptied the remaining liquid in the alley and also that he once dumped water in the alley from gallon pail which he used in mixing concrete. Perhaps this is what the Charbonneaus observed. He denies dumping any chemicals in the back alley. doubt that the placement of the shed, or the pouring of these liquids by Mr. Statchuk were the source of the problem. The grass was killed along the Charbonneau’s whole property line where it borders the alley ending precisely where the Charbonneau’s yard meets their neighbour’s. Without knowing what they were looking for, the laboratory personnel where Mr. Charbonneau sent the soil samples, did not know what to test for, though they did test for glyphosate as requested. Mr. Charbonneau testified that the cost to him to test for numerous substances until they found the presence of the one killing the grass would have been prohibitive. Therefore, there is no evidence of what substance got into the lawn and killed it. No samples were taken from the alley, to test for any chemical substance there. [9] Brian Hayes was the town employee called by the Plaintiff. From his testimony it appears highly unlikely that the offending substance came from gravel used in graveling the back alley. There were no similar issues anywhere else in town where gravel from the same source was used. Defence led evidence of the fact that house was demolished in the area and debris may have been removed through the back alley, suggesting that perhaps this was the cause. [10] The onus is not on the Defendant to establish an alternative source of the offending substance. The onus is on the Plaintiff to prove his claim on a balance of probabilities and this involves proving that Mr. Statchuk was responsible for killing their lawn. For the reasons stated, I find he has not done so. [11] I therefore dismiss the Plaintiff’s claim. am making no order as to costs. J.A.

Introduction [1] Daniel Smith was found guilty of the second degree murder of Roger Byer following a trial before a judge and jury.
Mr. Smith was sentenced to life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for 12 years.
[2] The pivotal evidence implicating Mr. Smith in the murder of Mr. Byer came from the testimony of Mr. Smith’s former common law spouse, Susan Saxon, and his friend, Dwight Windrum.
Defence counsel initially, and quite strongly, argued in favour of its inclusion.
However, after a lengthy exchange between the trial judge and both counsel, defence counsel not only abruptly withdrew his request for a Vetrovec warning, but insisted that it not be given.
[4] In the end, the trial judge did not give a Vetrovec warning in relation to either witness.
In his appeal to this Court, Mr. Smith argues that a Vetrovec warning was mandatory, regardless of the position taken by his counsel at the time of trial.
[5] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss Mr. Smith’s appeal.

Under that agreement the husband pays $3,000 per month in spousal support.

[3] The husband’s position is summarized in his affidavit as follows: 5.
...I own a 36% interest in a trucking company called “Titan Transport Ltd.” As a result of a general downturn in the economy during the year 2001, the profits of Titan Transport have been significantly reduced.
This decline was exacerbated by the events in New York and Washington on September 11, 2001.
As a result of this economic decline our company closed the Winnipeg Branch and laid off two employees in our Calgary office.
Our accountant calculates that the company's bottom line has declined by 62% from between the year end 2000 and the year end 2001.

There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy.
The applicant was entitled to know what he had been accused of and should have the right to correct the record.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 8, 3, 13, 15, 11, 14, 12, 10]",12,"J.

Nova Scotia (Attorney General), 2001 NSSC 85] Province of Nova Scotia Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act Subsection 41(1) IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA and IN THE MATTER OF AN APPEAL PURSUANT TO SECTION 41 OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND PROTECTION OF PRIVACY ACT S.N.S. 1993, c.5 HEARD BEFORE: The Honourable Justice David W. Gruchy PLACE HEARD: Halifax, Nova Scotia DATE HEARD: January 29 30, 2001 DECISION: June 13, 2001 COUNSEL: W. Dale Dunlop and Ken Mahoney a/c for Mr. Keating Edward A. Gores for the Attorney General Anne S. Derrick, Q.C. for the third party (name not to be known) GRUCHY, J.: [1] This is an appeal by Lee Keating (Keating) pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, S.N.S. 1993, c.5 (the Act). The appeal is taken from a decision of Robert Doherty, Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Coordinator of the Department of Justice, dated October 16, 1998, whereby the appellant was denied access to information requested. FACTUAL OVERVIEW [2] In 1994 and earlier there had been in Nova Scotia public allegations that physical, sexual, and other abuse had occurred in certain provincially operated institutions for youth correction and protection. As result of these public complaints in December, 1994, the Justice Minister of Nova Scotia, Bill Gillis, announced an investigation into these allegations. He appointed former Chief Justice of New Brunswick, the Honourable Stuart Stratton, Q.C. to investigate the matters. In June, 1995, Mr. Stratton reported that at least 89 former residents of the three institutions might have been abused. Among the institutions investigated by Mr. Stratton was the Shelburne Youth Centre (formerly the Nova Scotia School for Boys) at which Keating had been employed for many years. [3] In the conduct of the investigation, Mr. Stratton arranged to have statements taken from former residents of the institutions. He employed Facts-Probe Incorporated, operated by Harry Murphy and Mr. Murphy's son Duane, to obtain these statements. On Mr. Stratton's instructions the investigators made undertakings of confidentiality to former residents of the various institutions who gave the statements. [4] At the conclusion of Mr. Stratton's investigation he filed his final report. key recommendation of that report was that an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process be established whereby former residents claiming to have been abused could be compensated for that abuse. [5] Mr. Harry Murphy described in paras. 5, 6, 7, and of his affidavit the assurances given to former residents as follows: 5. Throughout the Stratton Investigation, Duane and assured victims that the investigation was confidential process and that their statements would not be circulated elsewhere without their permission. Some individuals inquired as to whether they would be compelled to testify as result of giving statement to Justice Stratton. They were consistently assured that they would not. 6. Issues and assurances related to confidentiality were normally dealt with as preliminary matter prior to any interviews. No written guarantee of confidentiality was provided, nor was any written form of release used or obtained during the Stratton Investigation. 7. During the Stratton investigation, from December 1994 to June 1995, reported only to Justice Stratton. All Statements obtained from victims were provided only to Justice Stratton, although some were later provided to the Provincial Department of Justice following submission of Justice Stratton's report and after victims signed release form, sample of which is attached to my Affidavit as Exhibit ""A"". 8. The Stratton Report was released on June 30, 1995. copy of that Report is attached to my Affidavit as Exhibit ""B"". Justice Stratton explained his rationale and approach to preserving confidentiality of victims in his report. Beginning at page (iii) of the introduction he states: ""The proposed investigation, in addition to being time and cost effective, was to have another significant positive feature. It would be carried out in private. Victims would not have to testify in public forum as several had already been required to do in the criminal trials of some of the perpetrators of the abuse. Rather, the victims of abuse would be able to tell their stories in private and without being made into public spectacles. The process was designed to avoid making these individuals victims all over again. The terms of reference stressed the importance of avoiding the revictimization of the victims by the process and expressly provided that the investigation was not to take place in public forum. Moreover the identities of victims were to be protected as far as possible."" 9. Later in the concluding comments of his Report, at page 99, Justice Stratton states: ""Many of the complainants who came forward did so only because of the assurances of confidentiality that was given to them. They told us in clear terms that they would not have spoken to us otherwise. This commitment to confidentiality must be honoured."" [6] The Province of Nova Scotia accepted Mr. Stratton's recommendation and in July of 1995, the Province through the Justice Minister announced an ADR process. Although initially one lawyer was to be retained to represent all claimants, the program was amended to allow other counsel to be retained by claimants. Negotiations were conducted between the Province and various counsel and on April 20, 1996, Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was completed, effective June 17, 1996. This MOU established guidelines and the method of ""adjudicating"" claims. There was no provision in the MOU whereby persons against whom allegations of abuse had been made would be afforded standing; Mr. Stratton had not addressed that subject. The MOU established guidelines for compensation and for the provision of counselling services. The Department of Justice in its submission to me described the ADR process as ""... summary process driven by the applicants/complainants."" [7] (The MOU and the various submissions and affidavits filed herein by or on behalf of the Province referred to the former residents of the institutions who complained of physical and/or sexual abuse as either ""victims"" or ""Survivors"". Because of the pejorative and prejudicial implications of those words will refer to them as ""claimants"".) [8] In the event the Province did not accept claim method of review was established. The review process did not include an opportunity for persons against whom allegations had been made to respond. [9] The Province has submitted that throughout the Stratton inquiry, the ADR process and all investigations thereafter or arising therefrom assurances of confidentiality were extended to all informants. [10] Subsequent to the release of the Stratton report in June 1995, the Department of Justice retained Facts-Probe Inc. to conduct further interviews to obtain information for employee discipline, possible criminal prosecution and ultimately to process insurance claims. In addition, in the spring of 1996, further interviews were conducted for use in the ADR process. The statements taken by Facts-Probe Inc. were made available to applicants and their counsel. Approximately seven or eight hundred persons were interviewed by Facts-Probe Inc. Releases were to be signed by all persons interviewed which releases contained consent for use of the statement for the purposes specifically set forth therein. [11] On or about December 13, 1996, Facts-Probe Inc., through Mr. Harry Murphy, withdrew its services from the Department of Justice as result of concern about possible conflict between the obligation undertaken pursuant to instructions of Mr. Stratton and those of the Department of Justice. Such conflict arose as result of the undertakings of confidentiality originally extended as compared to the amended undertakings extended by the Department of Justice. [12] In November of 1996, the ADR process was suspended. The Province apparently recognized the enormity of the task it had undertaken in this process. Amy Parker, lawyer of the Department of Justice of the Province of Nova Scotia who was assigned to the ""Compensation for Institutional Abuse Program"" filed an affidavit in this proceeding and in para.10 spoke of the temporary suspension of the program as follows: 10. On November 1, 1996 the Compensation process was temporarily suspended to allow the Province an opportunity to review and modify the compensation process. By letter dated December 6, 1996, attached to this my Affidavit as Exhibit ""C"", Jay Abbass, then Minister of Justice, assured victims and their counsel that the Province would remain committed to providing confidential compensation process upon its resumption, subject to modifications to allow the Province to fulfill its other related responsibilities, including employee discipline and child protection. [emphasis added] [13] will examine more fully the effect of the amendments of the process below. In many respects as of December 6, 1996, the ADR process may be considered have commenced anew. As of that date all applicants were required to sign new form of release. will detail below the development of the form of release then required. [14] As result of the number of complainants who came forward under the ADR process the Department of Justice (according to the Province's submission) transferred the bulk of the investigative work to its internal investigation Unit (IIU) for the processing of claims. do not have before me the terms of reference of IIU, but in 1998 those terms were expanded to include the investigation of alleged fraudulent claims. [15] It is not clear on the evidence before me when the Royal Canadian Mounted Police first became involved in the current investigations of institutional abuse. Inspector Atkins testified that the police force had been involved in 1992 in the investigation of one Patrick MacDougall for sexual offences. (Parenthetically, note that Keating had reported Patrick MacDougall initially which led to that prosecution.) Inspector Atkins testified that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had urged the Province not to proceed with the compensation program until thorough criminal investigation had been completed. Inspector Atkins' opinion was that offering compensation would potentially hinder criminal investigation. concluded from Inspector Atkins' testimony that was precisely what did occur. [16] In December of 1995, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police formed Task Force (Operation ""HOPE"") whose mandate was to conduct investigations into abuse alleged to have occurred within the various Nova Scotia youth centres. IIU and Operation ""HOPE"" then established liaison with one another whereby information was exchanged. [17] The ambit of the Operation ""HOPE"" investigation was restricted to the allegations of abuse. Operation ""HOPE"" cooperated with various departments of the Province which have an interest in the investigation of institutional abuse, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Community Services. Fraudulent claims arising from the ADR process are investigated by the Criminal Crime Section of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and according to Inspector Atkins it was anticipated that approximately 150 compensation program fraud complaints will be given by the Province to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. [18] The degree to which the various roles of the R.C.M.P., the Department of Justice, the Department of Community Service and the ADR Program became meshed and interchangeable is clearly set forth in paras. 11-33 of the affidavit of Inspector Atkins: 11. The investigation unit of the Department of Justice assigned to conduct the administrative investigations for employee discipline was formed in July 1995 under the direction of Mr. Robert Barss, and is known as the Internal Investigation Unit (IIU). The IIU, until August 1, 1998, also conducted investigations to validate compensation claims, after which time separate unit was formed known as the Validation Investigation Unit (VIU). The compensation program is under the direction of Mr. Michael Dempster. 12. The investigation material accumulated by both the IIU and the VIU is contained within single repository within the Department of Justice. The majority of information in that repository is electronically stored in Canadian Law Enforcement Information Management System (CLEIMS) data base situate in the IIU offices on the 9th floor, Bank of Montreal Building, 5151 George Street, in Halifax. Information not stored in the CLEIMS data base is in hard copy (paper) or on videotape. 13. Staff Sergeant James Brown, member of the RCMP, created the Operation ""HOPE"" task force in December 1995, and has since its inception been the primary investigator. As primary investigator, Staff Sergeant Brown maintains operational control over all aspects of the investigation by assigning investigative tasks to other investigators and reviewing the results of all investigative steps undertaken, thereby remaining cognizant of all information pertinent to the investigation. 14. have been advised by Staff Sergeant Brown, and do verily believe, that approximately 70% of the victims of abuse who have applied to the compensation program have also made criminal complaints of abuse to Operation ""HOPE"". small number of alleged victims of abuse have made compensation claims to the compensation program, but have not made criminal complaints to Operation ""HOPE"". smaller number of alleged victims have not made compensation claims to the compensation program, but have made criminal complaints to Operation ""HOPE"". This information is based on the fact that during the past two years Operation ""HOPE"" has frequently exchanged with the IIU lists of complainants and victims and other information relevant to their respective investigations. 15. have been advised by Staff Sergeant Brown, and do verily believe, that based on the exchanged lists of complaints and victims, the vast majority of persons who have made compensation claims, and whose complaints are the basis for the government employee discipline investigations, are the same as those persons who have made criminal complaints of abuse to Operation ""HOPE"". 16. have also been advised by Staff Sergeant Brown, and do verily believe, that the vast majority of those persons against whom allegations of institutional abuse have been made in compensation claims are the same as those persons against whom allegations of institutional abuse have been made in criminal complaints. 17. On May 12, 2000, was advised by Staff Sergeant Brown, and do verily believe, that since December 1995, in the course of its criminal investigations, Operation ""HOPE"" has interviewed, and taken video-taped statements from, more than 874 persons claiming they were subjected to some form of institutional abuse while resident at one or more of the Nova Scotia Youth Detention Centres and/or residential Schools. Most of those interviewed have alleged they were abused while they were resident at Shelburne Youth Centre, formerly known as the Nova Scotia School for Boys, which is one of the five Nova Scotia Youth Detention Centres and/or residential Schools. 18. have also been advised by Staff Sergeant Brown, and do verily believe, that allegations of abuse have been made against approximately 652 named and unnamed persons. 19. am aware that if complainant from whom Operation ""HOPE"" obtained video-taped statement also signed ""Consent to Release"" form, Operation ""HOPE"" provided copy of the video-taped statement to the IIU when requested to do so. On July 14, 1999, Staff Sergeant Brown advised me, and do verily believe, that since December 1995, Operation ""HOPE"" has provided approximately 453 video-taped statements to the IIU, and provided approximately 33 video-taped statements to the VIU. 20. Ms. Krista Bayart is an employee of the Nova Scotia Department of Justice and assigned to the compensation program as document research officer, providing research assistance to the IIU and the VIU, and has been so employed since September 1997. 21. Ms. Bayart reports to the Director of the compensation program, Mr. Michael Dempster, and the duties she performs include researching the CLEIMS data base as well as original provincial government and institutional documents, and writing memoranda and briefs in relation to information located. 22. have been advised by Ms. Bayart, and do verily believe, that during the course of the IIU and VIU investigations, approximately 757 persons who have submitted compensation claims have been interviewed by the IIU and the VIU investigators, and have provided video-taped statements, or, as in at least one instance, an audio-taped statement. 23. When requested to do so by Staff Sergeant Brown, the IIU and the VIU provided Operation ""HOPE"" with copy of video-taped statements taken by the IIU or the VIU. On May 12, 2000, Staff Sergeant Brown advised me, and do verily believe, that since December 1995, approximately 447 video-taped statements have been provided to Operation ""HOPE"" by the IIU and the VIU. 24. am aware that Operation ""HOPE"" investigators regularly review the content of the video-taped statements obtained from the IIU and compare their content with the video-taped statements given by the same person to Operation ""HOPE"" investigators. 25. have become aware from numerous conversations with Operation ""HOPE"" investigators over the course of my involvement with Operation ""HOPE"", that based on investigators' comparisons of the content of the IIU and Operation ""HOPE"" video-taped statements, that the type and frequency of the abuse complained of, and the identity of the persons allegedly responsible for that abuse, were identical in many cases, and similar, but not identical in other cases. 26 On March 16, 1998, upon the information of Constable Ross Pritchard, member of the RCMP and an investigator with ""Operation HOPE"", Mr. Justice J.P. Kennedy issued General Warrant pursuant to section 487.01 of the Criminal Code authorizing peace officer to enter the offices of the IIU, situate on the 9th floor, Bank of Montreal Building, 5151 George Street, Halifax Regional Municipality, on four separate and pre-authorized occasions over 12-month period to make an electronic copy of the data contained in the IIU computer system (CLEIMS). 27. Constable Daniel MacDonald, member of the RCMP and an investigator with Operation ""HOPE"", with the assistance of other peace officers, executed the General Warrant on three of the four authorized occasions; on April 3, 1998; on July 10, 1998; and on March 12, 1999. Due to the RCMP's extensive involvement in the investigation of the Swissair 111 crash on September 2, 1998, no execution was conducted on October 16, 1998. 28. On or about May 10, 1999, Constable MacDonald advised me, and verily believe, that on the first execution of the General Warrant on April 3, 1998, total of 356,591 image files were electronically copied and seized from the IIU's CLEIMS data base; on July 10, 1998 an additional 46,482 image files were electronically copied and seized; and on March 12, 1999, an additional 58,324 images were electronically copied and seized. 29. have been advised by Constable MacDonald, and do verily believe, that an image file, as copied and seized, is the equivalent of one-page paper document. 30. Based on the exchanged lists of criminal complainants and compensation claimants, on the exchanged video-taped statements between Operation ""HOPE"" and the IIU and the VIU, and on the CLEIMS data base images copied and seized from the IIU data base, have concluded that the similarities between the Operation ""HOPE"" investigations and the IIU and VIU investigations in terms of who the complainants/compensation applicants are, who the alleged abusers are, and the nature and frequency of the institutional abuse allegedly complained about indicates the IIU and VIU investigations are virtually indistinguishable from the Operation ""HOPE"" investigations, although the purposes for the investigations are different. 31. have been advised by Staff Sergeant Brown, and do verily believe, that Mr. Earle Leroy Keating, also known as Lee Keating, is former employee of the Nova Scotia School for Boys and of the Shelburne Youth Centre, and has been named as one of the 652 persons against whom allegations of institutional abuse have been made. 32. have been further advised by Staff Sergeant Brown, and do verily believe, that total of 35 criminal allegations have been made against Mr. Keating, and as of May 12, 2000, nine (9) of those allegations are still under active criminal investigation by Operation ""HOPE"". 33. am aware, that since October 1999, large quantities of historical provincial government records pertaining to the operation and administration of the Nova Scotia School for Boys and of the Shelburne Youth Centre and other Nova Scotia Youth Detention Centres and/or residential Schools have been located, and are, as at May 12, 2000, still being reviewed by Operation ""HOPE"" investigators and staff. As result of this review, it is possible that the number of allegations made against Mr. Keating and still under active investigation may change. [19] By December 3, 1996, Operation ""HOPE"", IIU and Facts-Probe Inc. were all investigating allegations of abuse and on the instructions of the Department of Justice the use to which claimants' statements could be put was expanded to include investigation of claims for compensation, the Province's claims against insurance companies, the Province's claims against ""perpetrators"", the discipline of employees, criminal investigations and for reports of child abuse to the Department of Community Services. In addition, of course, all information supplied to the government was subject to the provisions of the Act. [20] Throughout the entire ADR process there was much publicity and media attention. THE APPELLANT [21] Keating is retired Chief Supervisor of the Nova Scotia School for Boys at Shelburne, Nova Scotia. He had been in the employ of that institution in various capacities for 30 years. He retired in 1989 and in affidavits and material filed with me, together with his oral testimony, he claims to have been proud of his work in that institution, believing he had helped ""... many, many young individuals to get back on the path that led them to more productive and happier lives."" With the publication of the Stratton Report of purported widespread sexual and physical abuse Keating understandably claims to have been devastated. He understood that in the process undertaken by Mr. Stratton and in the subsequent ADR process he was named as and accused of being an abuser. The allegations attracted much media attention and the fact that many past and present employees of the institutions had been accused as perpetrators of abuse was public knowledge. This was especially so for the Sherlburne institution. [22] Keating had been aware of the allegations and was aware of the Stratton Inquiry and the findings of that Inquiry. Indeed, he was given certain ""can-say statements"" by the original investigators which outlined certain allegations by individuals made against him. Keating opined that while he agreed that any people who had been abused should be compensated he took great issue with the findings as to the extent of the abuse. He agreed with an ADR process but the process implemented and/or administered, he said, ""became nightmare for (him) and other former dedicated employees of the school for boys."" [23] He continued in his affidavit submitted to me and which he confirmed in his oral testimony: had anticipated that in deciding who was entitled to compensation that fundamental principles of justice, such as fairness, truth and objectivity, would be the cornerstone of the program. While the claimants were being spared the publicity of public trial and, more importantly cross-examination by experienced defence counsel as to the validity of their claims, did not anticipate that virtually no effort would be made to ascertain whether or not the allegations being levelled were true. During the course of the compensation process, have been shown by investigators employed by the government number of so-called ""can say"" statements from former residents at the school, making allegations against me. In each and every instance, these allegations are completely and totally false. so advised the investigators. further advised them that in many instances could provide them with positive evidence to rebut the allegations. This really is where my nightmare began. This then is the back ground to my application. know that allegations have been levelled against me. know the names of some of the individuals who have made some of the allegations because have been shown can say statements. do not know if there are other allegations or statements which have not been shown. Most importantly, do not know if persons have been compensated on the basis of the allegations made against me false allegations. do not know if the government has accepted the word of the claimants over mine and in effect branded me an abuser without my having chance to participate in the process. simply want to obtain information about myself in my role as former employee of the Province of Nova Scotia. am not seeking information about third parties. am not attempting to hinder any criminal investigation which may be underway. simply want to know the truth. [24] This appeal is taken pursuant to s-ss. (1) and (2) of s.41 of the Act, which subsections read as follows: Appeal to Supreme Court 41 (1) Within thirty days after receiving decision of the head of public body pursuant to Section 40, an applicant or third party may appeal that decision to the Supreme Court in such form and manner as may be prescribed by the Nova Scotia Civil Procedure Rules or by the regulations. Notice of appeal to third party (2) The head of public body who has refused request for access to record or part of record shall, immediately on receipt of notice of appeal by an applicant, give written notice of the appeal to any third party that the head of the public body (a) has notified pursuant to this Act; or (b) would have notified pursuant to this Act if the head of the public body had intended to give access to the record or part of the record. [25] The Attorney General of Nova Scotia has responded to this application and has resisted disclosure as requested by the appellant. Certain unnamed third parties, through counsel, have also resisted disclosure as requested. [26] On September 10, 1998, Keating had made application for information pursuant to the Act. He described the information sought as follows: INFORMATION PERTAINING TO ME IN THE N.S. GOVERNMENT""S PROGRAM OF ""COMPENSATION TO VICTIMS OF INSTITUTIONAL ABUSE"" (a) BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE PROGRAM INCLUDING CABINET DOCUMENTS (b) NUMBER AND NATURE OF ALLEGATIONS AGAINST ME, AND BY WHOM (c) SPECIFICS OF TIMES OF ALL ALLEGATIONS AGAINST ME (d) NUMBER AND DOLLAR AMOUNTS OF PAY OUTS MADE FOR ALLEGATIONS AGAINST ME (e) WHETHER ANY ALLEGATIONS AGAINST ME HAVE BEEN DISMISSED AS FRAUDULENT (f) WHETHER ANY ALLEGATIONS AGAINST ME ARE OUTSTANDING. [27] That application was refused on October 16, 1998 by Robert Doherty, the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act Coordinator and Keating then appealed to Mr. Darce Fardy, review officer, appointed pursuant to the Act. In that appeal Keating wrote 13-page letter in which he outlined his background, some of his work and employment history and set forth the reasons for his request for information. have referred to some of the information contained in that letter above. [28] Mr. Fardy by report dated March 11, 1999, reviewed Keating's request and submission. While he disagreed with certain of Keating's legal assumptions he analyzed the Province's response to the request. Mr. Fardy recommended: Recommendations: that the Department (of Justice) provide the Applicant, if he hasn't already received them, with ""can says"" regarding all of the accusations made against him. (The Applicant says he has received four ""can says"" but has evidence that there are other accusations made against him.). The summary should include the dates and times when the abuse is said to have occurred. that the Department provide the Applicant with list of any allegations that have proven to be false. that the Department provide the Applicant with the total value of compensation paid to those who accused him. that the Department provide this information in an expeditious fashion. [29] On April 29, 1999, Mr. Doherty, the ""FOIPOP Coordinator"" reaffirmed his original position and refused the disclosure sought. He held out the possibility that at some future time the refusal might be reviewed. [30] have been assured by counsel for the Attorney General that the ""FOIPOP Coordinator"", Mr. Robert Doherty, had been delegated the ""powers granted to and duties vested in (the Minister) pursuant to s.44 of the Act. The delegation of the duty of the head of public body (in this case the Minister of Justice) to Mr. Doherty, presumably as ""FOIPOP Coordinator"", created an anomalous situation. Keating's first request for information was received by Mr. Doherty and was adjudicated upon in his delegated authority as head of the public body pursuant to s.7. Upon Mr. Doherty's refusal, Keating's right of appeal was to Review Officer, who in this case was Mr. Fardy of the Nova Scotia Utilities and Review Board. The Review Officer then pursuant to s.39, recommended to the head of the public body (Mr. Doherty by virtue of his delegated position) who, pursuant to s.40 of the Act is empowered to ""make decision to follow the recommendation of the review officer or any other decision that the head of the public body considers appropriate."" In effect, Mr. Doherty in his delegated positions is authorized to overrule any recommendation which might have the effect of overruling his initial decision. [31] Following the decision by the Coordinator, Keating then commenced this appeal. By submission dated May 1, 2000, Keating's counsel, Mr. W. Dale Dunlop, amended the request for information so that the following specific requests have been made: 1) the number and nature of allegations made against Mr. Keating and by whom those allegations were made; 2) the specific times and dates of all the allegations made against Mr. Keating; 3) the evidence collected in relation to investigations undertaken as result of the allegations; 4) any documents created or used in the adjudicative process and the reasoning and deliberations of the review officers involved in the program with respect to claims against Mr. Keating; 5) information on any action taken as result of the review officers recommendations; 6) the number and dollar amount of payouts made with respect to allegations against Mr. Keating; 7) whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed as fraudulent or unproven; 8) whether any allegations remain. [32] interpret these requests to be an amplification of the generality of Keating's request of September 10, 1998. [33] The Province attempted to comply with s-s. (2) of s.41 of the Act whereby notice to third parties is required, but have been informed by the Attorney General, and accept, that although attempts were made to inform the third parties (claimants) of this appeal, the present whereabouts of many of them is now unknown. am satisfied that there has been acceptable compliance with that subsection. [34] My powers in this appeal are set forth in s.42 of the Act, s-s. (1) of which reads: Powers of Court 42 (1) On an appeal, the Supreme Court may (a) determine the matter de novo; and (b) examine any record in camera in order to determine on the merits whether the information in the record may be withheld pursuant to this Act. [35] The Attorney General submitted that as this appeal is to be determined de novo the standard of review is one of correctness and has cited the decision of Tidman, J., in Jobb v. Nova Scotia (Department of Justice) (1999), 174 N.S.R. (2d) 380 (N.S.S.C.). held during the hearing of this matter (over the objection of the Province), that as the matter is to be heard de novo the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Dennis (1960), 1960 CanLII 34 (SCC), 125 C.C.C. 321 (S.C.C.) applies: ... the distinction between ""an appeal by holding trial de novo"" and an appeal to the provincial Court of Appeal is that although the object of both is to determine whether the decision appealed from was right or wrong, in the latter case the question is whether it was right or wrong having regard to the evidence upon which it was based, whereas in the former the issue is to be determined without any reference, except for purposes of cross-examination, to the evidence called in the Court appealed from and upon fresh determination based upon evidence called anew and perhaps accompanied by entirely new evidence. [36] Duhaime's Law Dictionary defines the term ""de novo"" as follows: ""de novo"" Latin: new. This term is used to refer to trial which starts over, which wipes the slate clean and begins all over again, as if any previous partial or complete hearing had not occurred. [37] The Dictionary of Canadian Law, Dukelow Nuse defines de novo as follows: ""de novo"". [L] Fresh; new; ""de novo hearing"": rehearing; ""trial de novo"": form of appeal in which the case is retried. [38] Accordingly, decided in hearing this matter would proceed by considering all information that was before the coordinator at the time of his final decision and such further evidence produced to me whether by affidavit or by oral testimony. considered the request for information as amended by Keating and his counsel as if presented de novo. [39] For the purposes of this appeal, therefore, have before me the following: (1) Notice of Appeal dated April 29, 1999, to which is attached (a) application for access to record dated September 10, 1998; (b) letter to Darce Fardy dated December 21, 1998; (c) the report and recommendation of Darce Fardy dated March 11, 1999; (d) the decision appealed from, in the form of letter dated April 12, 1999, from Mr. Doherty; (2) Memorandum of Argument from appellant's solicitor, Dale Dunlop, dated May 1, 2000, by which the amendments to the original request for information was confirmed; (3) Affidavit of Chief Inspector Ian E. Atkins of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; (4) Affidavit of Harry Murphy of Facts-Probe Incorporated to which was appended the following exhibits: (a) sample release form used by Honourable Justice Stuart Stratton, Q.C.; (b) copy of the ""Stratton Report""; (c) copy of contract between Facts-Probe Inc. and the Department of Justice; (d) correspondence, described as introductory letter from the Department of Justice dated August 31, 1995; (e) correspondence from the Department of Justice dated December 3, 1996, mandating consent to certain uses to which disclosed information may be used; (5) Notice of Appeal by Lee Keating from the decision of the head of the public body, which notice is dated April 29, 1999 and to which is attached: (a) original application for access dated September 10, 1998; (b) appellant's brief to the review officer dated December 21, 1998; (c) decision of Robert Doherty dated April 12, 1999, refusing access as requested; (6) Affidavit of Amy Parker solicitor of the Department of Justice to which is appended the following exhibits: (a) memorandum of understanding regarding compensation for survivors of institutional abuse; (b) letter from the Department of Justice dated July 18, 1996 to ""counsel for survivors of institutional abuse; (c) letter from the Minister of Justice, Jay Abbass, dated December 6, 1996 to ""all compensation lawyers""; (7) Affidavit of Michael Dempster, former program director of the ""Compensation for Institutional Abuse Program"" to which is appended the following exhibits: (a) November 1997 guidelines for the Compensation for Institutional Abuse Program; (8) Affidavit of Francine McIntyre, clinical therapist; (9) Letter dated May 30, 2000, from the solicitor for the Department of Justice, Edward Gores, to Honourable Justice Margaret Stewart enclosing: (a) Nova Scotia information directory published on the Province's website and (b) Robert Doherty's letter of October 16, 1998, to the appellant, being the first response of the head of the public body to the appellant; (10) Affidavit of Elizabeth Mullaly, solicitor employed by the Province of Nova Scotia in the Compensation for Institutional Abuse Program to which is appended various exhibits demonstrating the documentation methods used by the program. [40] have also received the following submissions: (1) appellant's memorandum of argument addressed to the Honourable Justice Margaret Stewart, dated May 1, 2000, consisting of 20 pages; (2) prehearing submission of the Attorney General of Nova Scotia dated May 29, 2000, consisting of 49 pages together with book of authorities; (3) applicant's reply to Attorney General's submission dated July 7, 2000, consisting of nine pages; (4) further applicant's reply to Attorney General's submissions on law enforcement dated July 12, 2000, consisting of nine pages; (5) third party's response to appellant's supplementary submissions dated September 15, 2000, consisting of two pages; (6) post-hearing submissions of the Attorney General of Nova Scotia dated February 21, 2001, consisting of 67 pages and appendices; (7) appellant's post-hearing submission dated March 7, 2001, consisting of eight pages; (8) brief on behalf of unnamed third parties; (9) reply of the Attorney General.

[43] For the purposes of this appeal I have considered all of the above material including Robert P. Doherty's decision of April 12, 1999 which latter item I have considered to be the decision appealed from in the context of a de novo process. In addition, certain of the contents of the affidavits are expressions of opinions which in my view in the circumstances are inadmissible. need not detail the latter observation. UNDERTAKINGS AND RELEASES [44] In the consideration of the various aspects of the Act it is essential to develop an understanding of the extent of any undertakings with respect to the confidentiality of the information sought and obtained. At the risk of some repetition, the following is chronological summary of certain events which consider important in the development of an understanding of the undertaking. (1) December 1994. The Stratton investigation was commenced and Facts-Probe Incorporated was engaged to undertake confidential interviews with alleged ""victims and employees"". (2) June 30, 1995. The Honourable Stuart Stratton, Q.C. completed his investigation and filed his report. Claimants had not been required to testify in public and the ""victims of abuse"" had been given an opportunity to ""... tell their stories in private and without being made into public spectacles."" Mr. Stratton, however, did say: The Minister of Justice acknowledged, however, that the fact that an investigation was to be done would not necessarily preclude an eventual public inquiry. Mr. Stratton in his investigation took steps to protect the identities of the victims as far as possible. He reported that he had attempted to take such measures to protect the privacy of the victims as were consistent with public scrutiny of the events and actions that were the subject of the investigation. However, at no time during the Stratton investigation was there any opportunity for claimants to face their alleged abusers, nor were the alleged abusers given the opportunity to face their accusers. In Mr. Stratton's conclusions he said at p.99: Many of the complainants who came forward and gave us statements did so only because of the assurance of confidentiality that was given to them. They told us in clear terms that they would not have spoken to us otherwise. This commitment to confidentiality must be honoured. At no time during the investigation did Mr. Stratton or Facts-Probe Inc. require that complainants sign releases. (3) July, 1995. The Department of Justice's internal investigation unit (IIU) was formed ""... to conduct the administrative investigations for employee discipline."" Until August 1, 1998, that unit also conducted investigations to validate compensation claims when that function was taken over by the Validation Investigation Unit (VIU). Both units are of the Department of Justice. (4) August 1, 1995. Facts-Probe Inc. was mandated by the Department of Justice to ""contact all people who came forward to (the Stratton Inquiry) to identify if any of them are willing to give statement to the R.C.M.P., or to give statement to the Province of Nova Scotia to assist it in investigations of current employees, or to give statement to allow an investigation of alleged abusers under s.63 of the Children and Family Services Act to determine whether the alleged abuser poses risk to children. (5) September 1, 1995. The Province entered into an agreement with Facts-Probe Inc. ""... to conduct investigations as are required by the Minister of Justice or his designate, always under his direction, and to his satisfaction."" (6) December 1995. Operation ""HOPE"" was established by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for the purpose of conducting criminal investigations into allegations of child abuse. Operation ""HOPE"" supplied copies of statements given by claimants to IIU, provided the claimant executed form of release. That release reads as follows: of consent to and authorize the Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigators from Operation ""HOPE"" to release my video taped interview and notes relating to the interview to the Province of Nova Scotia for the purpose of compensation and/or internal investigation. (7) May 15, 1996. memorandum of understanding was completed and executed between the Province of Nova Scotia and counsel for ""survivors"". This memorandum, inter alia, provided: 6. Statements given by Survivor and reduced to writing or recorded on videotape or audiotape with view to validating the Survivor's claim for compensation shall be used only for purposes of this process and shall not be released to the public without the prior written consent of the Survivor. The memorandum required the execution of release by claimants prior to obtaining compensation. (8) The memorandum of understanding prescribed the form of release which did not specify the use to which statement could be put. (9) July 18, 1996. The Department of Justice requested claimants' counsel to keep confidential all information on institutional records which relate to people other than their specific clients. This undertaking ""... would allow us to send counsel page from the medical log which has notations relating to counsel's client without the time-consuming necessity of blanking out all other information ..."" (10) December 6, 1996. The then Minister of Justice acknowledged that from November 1, 1996, the Department had suspended the ADR process in order to allow the Province time to address several issues of concern. He announced that the process would continue but changed certain time limitations within the process. He also indicated that statement protocol was to be developed among the R.C.M.P., the IIU and Facts-Probe Inc. He said: All three organizations will share information, and investigations will be coordinated to the fullest extent possible recognizing the independence of police investigations. Statements provided for the purpose of compensation will be used for investigative purposes (whether criminal or disciplinary), and for the Child Abuse Registry, in keeping with government's obligations. remain committed to providing claimants with confidential and respectful process. recognize that some may not wish their statements to be used in this wider forum; however think it strikes an appropriate balance between the interest of survivors and those of all Nova Scotians in seeing perpetrators brought to justice. (Once again, there was no opportunity for present and past employees to respond to allegations made against them.) On or before August, 1996, the form of release required of all claimants was as follows: Release Form I, of in the Province of hereby consent to the release of my name and any information given by me in the course of the Stratton investigation, or in the course of follow-up to this investigation, of abuse in provincial institutions to: Check one, two or all three: 1. The Province of Nova Scotia 2. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, or other appropriate police force. 3. To determine whether the allegations of abuse can be investigated by relevant Children's Aid Society or the Province for the purpose of entering the abuser's name in the Child Abuse Register. DATED this day of A.D., 199 Witness Signature (11) December 3, 1996. Apparently in response to problem raised on November 25, 1996, the Deputy Minister of Justice wrote to Facts-Probe Inc. concerning the use of statements which Facts-Probe Inc. obtained from persons seeking compensation. The Deputy Minister specified that statements obtained after November 25, 1996, should incorporate the following statement: understand the statement am about to give may be used for (a) my claim against the Province for compensation, and any action by the Province to recover from insurance companies or perpetrators; (b) discipline of present employees of the Province; (c) police investigation of offences disclosed in the statement; and (d) report of child abuse to the Department of Community Services, and any investigation undertaken by that Department or child protection agency. Facts-Probe Inc. was instructed that it should not take statement from person who does not agree with the foregoing because once the information is in the hands of the Department of Justice there is an obligation to act upon it. (12) December 6, 1996. The Minister of Justice wrote to ""all compensation lawyers"" concerning the ADR process. have referred to the contents of that letter when addressing the subject of the affidavit of Amy Parker. (13) November, 1997. The Province established ""Guidelines for the Compensation for Institutional Abuse Program of the Province of Nova Scotia."" These guidelines provided that statements were mandatory and that claimants might be requested to give further statements. It required that all statements be truthful and as of October 1, 1997, all statements were to be taken by the IIU only. It did provide, however, that statements given to the R.C.M.P. or Facts-Probe Inc. prior to that date, will continue to be accepted for the purposes of filing demand. Article 5.6 of the Guidelines stated: 5.6 Statement may be used by the Province, without notice to the Claimant, for purposes relating to the alleged Physical and/or Sexual Abuse including, but not limited to: a. discipline proceedings relating to present Employees of the Province; b. any investigation or prosecution of an offence; c. report of child abuse to the Department or Community Services, and any investigation undertaken by the Department or child protection agency; d. civil litigation on behalf of or against the Province or child protection agency; or e. the identification of potential witnesses for the investigation and validation of claims. The Guidelines continued: 5.7 The Province undertakes to treat all Claimant information it holds or receives in respect of Claimant's Demand for compensation in accordance with its obligations under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. While the Guidelines contemplated the investigation of claims, no provision was made for response by employees or former employees against whom allegations were made. The Guidelines again specified form of release to be executed by claimants which included the following: 8. understand and agree that at any time, now or in the future, the Statement(s) and other material have submitted in support of my claim may be subject to investigation regarding the accuracy of the Statements and material. 9. understand the Statement(s) and other material have submitted in support of my claim may be used without notice to me for purpose of assessment of my claim and for other purposes relating to alleged abuse, including but not limited to: a. discipline proceedings relating to present employees of the Province; b. any investigation or prosecution of an offence; c. report of child abuse to the Department of Community Services, and any investigation undertaken by that Department or child protection agency; d. civil litigation on behalf of or against the Province or child protection agency; or e. the identification of potential witnesses for the investigation and validation of claims. (14) August 1, 1998. The Validation Investigation Unit (VIU) assumed the obligation of conducting investigations to validate compensation claims from the IIU. Of course, both are of the Department of Justice. GROUNDS FOR REFUSAL [45] The grounds for the refusal by the Minister of Justice are set forth in the Minister's pretrial memorandum and post-trial brief. In the latter the Minister has identified the issues in this appeal as follows: (a) person the subject of criminal investigation ought not to have access to information which might harm law enforcement; (b) person the subject of criminal investigation ought not to have access to information where such disclosure might harm the effectiveness of investigative techniques or procedures currently used or likely to be used; (c) person the subject of criminal investigation ought not to have access to information which could reasonably be expected to reveal the identity of confidential source of law enforcement information; (d) person the subject of criminal investigation ought not to have access to information which could reasonably be expected to reveal in any way the exercise of prosecutorial discretion; (e) person the subject of criminal investigation ought not to have access to information which is in law enforcement record and which, if disclosed, could reasonably be expected to expose the author of the record (or person who has been quoted or paraphrased in the record) to civil liability; (f) public body is entitled to refuse to disclose information where the disclosure could reasonably be expected to harm the financial or economic interests of public body or the Government of Nova Scotia, particularly information about negotiations carried on by or for public body or the Government of Nova Scotia; (g) person should not have access to personal information where the disclosure would be an unreasonable invasion of third party's personal privacy; (h) Disclosure of personal information compiled and part of an investigation into possible violation of law is presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of the third party's personal privacy. [46] The Minister then identified the various sections of the Act relied upon for the refusal to disclosure as follows: Sections 20(1), (2), (3)(b) and 20(4); 15(1)(a), (c), (d) and (f); 15(2)(b) and 17(1)(e). For the sake of completeness those subsections are now set forth in full: Personal information 20 (1) The head of public body shall refuse to disclose personal information to an applicant if the disclosure would be an unreasonable invasion of third party's personal privacy. Determination of unreasonable invasion of privacy (2) In determining pursuant to subsection (1) or (3) whether disclosure of personal information constitutes an unreasonable invasion of third party's personal privacy, the head of public body shall consider all the relevant circumstances, including whether (a) the disclosure is desirable for the purpose of subjecting the activities of the Government of Nova Scotia or public body to public scrutiny; (b) the disclosure is likely to promote public health and safety or to promote the protection of the environment; (c) the personal information is relevant to fair determination of the applicant's rights; (d) the disclosure will assist in researching the claims disputes or grievances of aboriginal people; (e) the third party will be exposed unfairly to financial or other harm; (f) the personal information has been supplied in confidence; (g) the personal information is likely to be inaccurate or unreliable; and (h) the disclosure may unfairly damage the reputation of any person referred to in the record requested by the applicant. Presumed unreasonable invasion of privacy (3) disclosure of personal information is presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of third party's personal privacy if (b) the personal information was compiled and is identifiable as part of an investigation into possible violation of law, except to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prosecute the violation or to continue the investigation; Presumed not unreasonable invasion of privacy (4) disclosure of personal information is not an unreasonable invasion of third party's personal privacy if (a) the third party has, in writing, consented to or requested the disclosure; (b) there are compelling circumstances affecting anyone's health or safety; (c) an enactment authorizes the disclosure; (d) the disclosure is for research or statistical purpose and is in accordance with Section 29 or 30; (e) the information is about the third party's position, functions or remuneration as an officer, employee or member of public body or as member of minister's staff; (f) the disclosure reveals financial and other similar details of contract to supply goods or services to public body; (g) the information is about expenses incurred by the third party while travelling at the expense of public body; (h) the disclosure reveals details of licence, permit or other similar discretionary benefit granted to the third party by public body, not including personal information supplied in support of the request for the benefit; or (i) the disclosure reveals details of discretionary benefit of financial nature granted to the third party by public body, not including personal information that is supplied in support of the request for the benefit or is referred to in clause (c) of subsection (3). Law enforcement 15 (1) The head of public body may refuse to disclose information to an applicant if the disclosure could reasonably be expected to (a) harm law enforcement; (c) harm the effectiveness of investigative techniques or procedures currently used, or likely to be used, in law enforcement; (d) reveal the identity of confidential source of law-enforcement information; (f) reveal any information relating to or used in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion; Further grounds (2) The head of public body may refuse to disclose information to an applicant if the information (a) is in law-enforcement record and the disclosure would be an offence pursuant to an enactment; (b) is in law-enforcement record and the disclosure could reasonably be expected to expose to civil liability the author of the record or person who has been quoted or paraphrased in the record; or Financial or economic interests 17 (1) The head of public body may refuse to disclose to an applicant information the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to harm the financial or economic interests of public body or the Government of Nova Scotia or the ability of the Government to manage the economy and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, may refuse to disclose the following information: (e) information about negotiations carried on by or for public body or the Government of Nova Scotia. [47] In addition to s.17(1)(e), the Minister has essentially set forth two general grounds for the refusal to disclose: interference with law enforcement and invasion of personal privacy. [48] will deal firstly with the matter of invasion of personal privacy, secondly with the matter of law enforcement considerations and finally, the question of financial or economic interests. [49] Justice Cromwell of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal outlined the approach he followed in the circumstances of Dickie v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Health) (1999), 1999 CanLII 7239 (NS CA), 176 N.S.R. (2d) 333 (C.A.), paras. [5] and [6]: [5] The application of the Act in this case involves three step analysis. Under the Act, personal information (a defined term) is not to be disclosed if its disclosure would be an unreasonable invasion of third party's personal privacy. The first step in the analysis is, therefore, to determine whether the disputed material is personal information within the meaning of the Act. Disclosure of personal information relating to employment history is presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of personal privacy. (s.20(3)(d)). The second step, therefore, is to determine whether this presumption applies to the disputed material. The presumption, however, is only that. It may be rebutted if, taking into account all of the relevant circumstances, including the matters specified in s. 20(2), it is concluded that the disclosure is not an unreasonable invasion of third party's personal privacy. The third step is to make that determination. [6] While there are some subsidiary matters to be addressed, the main issues on the appeal relate to these three steps of the analysis. would state the issues as follows: 1. Do the disputed documents contain ""personal information"" within the meaning of the Act? 2. If so, is it personal information related to employment history so that its disclosure is presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of personal privacy? 3. Does the balancing of all the relevant circumstances favour disclosure? [50] Justice Moir took similar approach in Re Cyril House ((N.S.S.C.) April 20, 2000, (unreported) (S.H. No. 160555). He analyzed the approach which he followed in that case as follows: propose to consider this appeal in the following way: 1. Is the requested information ""personal information"" within s.3(1)(i)? If not, that is the end. Otherwise must go on. 2. Are any of the conditions of s.20(4) satisfied? If so, that is the end. Otherwise ... 3. Is the personal information presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of privacy pursuant to s.20(3)? 4. In light of any s.20(3) presumption, and in light of the burden upon the appellant established by s.45(2), does the balancing of all relevant circumstances, including those listed in s.20(2), lead to the conclusion that disclosure would constitute an unreasonable invasion of privacy or not? [51] Both these approaches are restricted in their purview to the matter of ""personal information"". [52] As have said, the evidence of Elizabeth Mullaly, by affidavit and orally, persuaded me that any meaningful production of documents will require more analysis of documents by the Department. am not now reviewing specific documents. [53] Inspector Atkins said that 35 allegations were made against Keating and at the time of hearing this appeal nine of those allegations were still outstanding and required further R.C.M.P. investigation. These allegations undoubtedly were of personal nature from the points of view of the complainants (third parties) and of Keating. [54] For the specific purposes of my analysis of the facts in this case, as they relate to personal information, will adopt the approach of Justice Moir in Cyril House. 1. The information supplied by various complainants, whether orally, in writing, videotaped or reduced to writing concerning Keating were ""personal information"" within the meaning of s.3(i) of the Act; they undoubtedly included recorded information about the complainants and Keating. Allegations of abuse by complainants do not fall neatly within the various numbered sub-paragraphs of s-s. (i), but do conclude that such allegations are included in the general description, ""... recorded information about an identifiable individual ..."" 2. disclosure of personal information, however, is not necessarily an unreasonable invasion of third party's personal privacy. As Moir, J. concluded, if any of the conditions of s.20(4) are satisfied, ""... that is the end"" of the consideration and the material is to be disclosed. My analysis of the various releases required of claimants, assuming they were appropriately completed, leads me to the conclusion that the claimants have consented to disclosure or to process which would inevitably and unavoidably lead to disclosure to Keating. If the information leads to criminal proceedings against him, Keating would have had to have disclosure. If the information leads to proceeding to enter his name on the Child Abuse Register, Keating would have to have disclosure. If the information leads to employee discipline (and the claimant would have had no reason to realize that Keating had retired) Keating would have had to have disclosure. If the information leads to civil action against perpetrator of abuse or against an insurer of the Province, or to the identification of witnesses, Keating would have had to have disclosure. The Attorney General has cited many cases which considered the matter of personal privacy. None, however, was case dealing with releases of the kind executed by the claimants herein and, accordingly, while helpful, do not provide specific guidance. Justice Wright of this Court addressed the question of the confidentiality of the information sought herein in relation to an application for production pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 20.06 and 26.06 in case dealing with an action by the Province for insurance indemnification for awards made to claimants in the ADR process. That case is Nova Scotia (Attorney General) v. Royal Sun Alliance Insurance Co. of Canada et al. (2000), 190 N.S.R. (2d) 208 (N.S.S.C.). Justice Wright said at p.212: [17] Dealing first with the individual complainants, it is to be noted that number of them have since signed what is commonly known as the second or third forms of release through the ADR Compensation Program which specifically authorized the Province to use their statements and other supporting material for purposes of recovery proceedings against the insurers. There is further number of individual claimants who have signed the form of release attached as exhibit to the Harry Murphy Affidavit. This is essentially consent form by virtue of which individual complainants authorized the release of their names and any information given in the course of the Stratton investigation, or in the course of follow-up to the investigation, to any one or more of the Province of Nova Scotia, the RCMP or other police force, or the Children's Aid Society for the purpose of entering an abuser's name in the Child Abuse Register. Given that waiver, there can not be said to have been reasonable expectation of privacy or confidentiality of such information from the Province's liability insurers, especially where the Province announced prior to Mr. Stratton's appointment that in the event that liability was determined, compensation to residents would be paid. [18] That leaves pool of individual complainants, the size of which is unknown to the court but which is probably relatively small, who gave statements to Mr. Stratton or his investigators but who did not sign any such form of release or consent. It is really only this group of individual complainants in respect of which the claim for confidentiality of communication can be asserted. [22] turn now to the claim for privilege over the interviews and/or statements given by several employees of the five subject residential schools in the course of the Stratton investigation. Although the confidentiality Order does not extend to these individuals, conclude that the claim for privilege does not satisfy the four Wigmore criteria. These individuals, who spoke to the Stratton investigation team on voluntary basis, must be taken to have known that any assurances of confidentiality could not be absolute where the request through their union president for immunity from criminal prosecution or disciplinary action could not be granted. Mr. Stratton simply had no authority to grant any such immunity and said so. At all events, the interest of the defendants at stake in this litigation in making full answer and defence to the claims that are brought against them outweighs any interest that might be at stake in the maintenance of the relationship between the Stratton investigation and the employees who were interviewed. Documents pertaining to discussions with employees of the five residential schools must therefore be produced by the plaintiff for purposes of this litigation. [23] Having thus disposed of the claims for privilege in respect of the individual complainants and employees of the five residential schools under investigation, come full circle to the blanket assertion of privilege which extends to the remainder of the contents of the eight sealed cartons of material. As noted earlier, these contain records of interviews of past and present department officials and superintendents of the five residential schools, as well as files obtained from police and from the Ministers of Justice and Community Services. [24] No authority has been cited to me to demonstrate that the law recognizes blanket privilege claim over spectrum of documents. Indeed, it was said by Justice Dickson in R. v. Solosky, 1979 CanLII (SCC), [1980] S.C.R. 821; 30 N.R. 380, that privilege can only be claimed document by document, with each document being required to meet the criteria for the privilege. Obviously, that analysis cannot be done in the present application where the documents remain sealed in boxes which are in the possession of the Province. [25] The argument is made by the defendants that since the blanket claim for privilege over these documents must fail, and so find, the entirety of the contents of these boxes must now be produced by the plaintiff without any prior review of them by plaintiff's counsel. Plaintiff's counsel have submitted, on the other hand, that in the event that disclosure is ordered, they ought to be afforded an opportunity to undertake review of the documentation to determine whether such issues as relevance, solicitor-client privilege or Cabinet privilege might warrant non-disclosure. respectfully agree with Justice Wright's reasoning and conclusions. therefore conclude that s.20(4)(a) applies and subject to certain conditions expressed below, disclosure of allegations of abuse made against Keating is not an unreasonable invasion of claimants' privacy. 3. Notwithstanding my conclusion that the claimants may have consented to disclosure, will proceed to consideration of s.20 of the Act. Section 20(2): Would disclosure of the information ""... be an unreasonable invasion of third party's personal privacy...""? In the formulation of my answer to this general question am to consider all relevant circumstances as have been put before me. Section 20(2)(a): Is disclosure desirable for the purpose of subjecting the activities of the Government of Nova Scotia or public body to public scrutiny? The public body, in this context, is the Department of Justice and the ADR process. Keating, however, has only requested information with respect to himself. He has alleged that public funds may have been spent on false and unproven accusations against him and that he (and inferentially the public), is entitled to scrutinize the allegations made against him and the process by which expenditures were made as result of those allegations. agree with his general position, but disclosure, in my view, should not specify amounts paid to individual claimants; nor can it identify amounts paid for particular acts. accept the evidence of Elizabeth Mullaly that the records of the process will not permit such specific accountability. Section 20(2)(b): Will the disclosure of personal information sought be ""... relevant to fair determination of the applicant's rights?"" In my view, in order to determine his rights, Keating has right to know what persons have accused him of abusive behaviour and the specifics of those complaints. distinguish between R.C.M.P. held information and that of the Department of Justice and the ADR process. Section 20(2)(e): do not understand how third party ""... will be exposed unfairly to financial or other harm."" The Attorney General has submitted that third parties may be subject to possible defamation actions. That may be correct; but the question is whether such exposure would be unfair. Truth (justification) is always defence in defamation action and in certain circumstances, so is the defence of qualified privilege. Accordingly, am unable to see any element of unfairness in the possible exposure of third parties to defamation action. Section 20(2)(f): Has the personal information been supplied in confidence? The affidavit evidence submitted by the Attorney General, together with the oral testimony of the Attorney General's witnesses show that promises of confidentiality were extended to third parties at various times since the inception of the process. Mr. Stratton through Facts-Probe Inc., undoubtedly extended promises of confidentiality. Those promises and undertakings must be respected but as have noted above, they were all clearly subject to the provisions of the Act. In addition and obviously, Keating has not requested the information supplied to Mr. Stratton. Those undertakings, however, were as have set forth above subject to the possibility of an eventual public inquiry. [55] After the Stratton inquiry report, the purposes for statements given by complainants changed dramatically. The purpose of the Internal Investigation Unit, as early as July, 1995, was for ""investigations for employee discipline"". That purpose surely contemplated confrontation of employees accused of abuse. Notwithstanding oral undertakings given to complainants, that was the recorded purpose for further statements taken from complainants. While that purpose might not necessarily have included public aspect, it most certainly contemplated that an alleged abuser (Keating) would be made aware of the complaints and would be afforded the opportunity to respond. [56] The matter of determination of whether information was ""received in confidence"" was examined closely in Order No. 331-1999; Vancouver Police Board, [1999] B.C.I.P.C.D. No. 44. In that case the Commissioner posed the question to be addressed as follows: 37 What are the indicators of confidentiality in such cases? In general, it must be possible to conclude that the information has been received in confidence based on its content, the purpose of its supply and receipt, and the circumstances in which it was prepared and communicated. The evidence of each case will govern, but one or more of the following factors which are not necessarily exhaustive will be relevant in s.16(1)(b) cases: 1. What is the nature of the information? Would reasonable person regard it as confidential? Would it ordinarily be kept confidential by the supplier or recipient? 2. Was the record prepared for purpose that would not be expected to require or lead to disclosure in the ordinary course? 3. Was the record in question explicitly stated to be provided in confidence? (This may not be enough in some cases, since other evidence may show that the recipient in fact did not agree to receive the record in confidence or may not actually have understood there was true expectation of confidentiality.) 4. Was the record supplied voluntarily or was the supply compulsory? Compulsory supply will not ordinarily be confidential, but in some cases there may be indications in legislation relevant to the compulsory supply that establish confidentiality. (The relevant legislation may even expressly state that such information is deemed to have been supplied in confidence.) 5. Was there an agreement or understanding between the parties that the information would be treated as confidential by its recipient? 6. Do the actions of the public body and the supplier of the record including after the supply provide objective evidence of an expectation of or concern for confidentiality? 7. What is the past practice of the recipient public body respecting the confidentiality of similar types of information when received from the supplier or other similar suppliers? In my view, in view of the releases signed and the express purposes for the various releases, it is clear that the record or information obtained could not have been expected to remain confidential. Accordingly, the answer to Question No. posed above would be in the negative. Similarly, while various witnesses said that they promised confidentiality orally, such promises fly squarely in the face of the wording of the various releases. Therefore, the answer to Question posed above must be that there was an express agreement in writing as to the potentially public uses which could be made of the information. [57] The purpose for the taking of statements, by August 1995, included an investigation of alleged abusers under s.63 of the Children and Family Services Act That is the Child Abuse Register section of that Act. Subsections (3) and (4) of s.63 read as follows: Application for finding of abuse (3) The Minister or an agency may apply to the court, upon notice to the person whose name is intended to be entered in the Child Abuse Register, for finding that, on the balance of probabilities, the person has abused child. In camera hearing (4) hearing pursuant to subsection (3) shall be held in camera except the court may permit any person to be present if the court considers it appropriate. 1990, c.5, s.63. [58] Accordingly, any action taken pursuant to this section of the Children and Family Services Act would require notice to an alleged abuser (Keating) and an opportunity for that person to respond. [59] It was also made clear by the various Ministers of Justice throughout this process that statements given by claimants might be used for the purposes of conducting criminal investigations. will deal more precisely with the matter of criminal investigations below, but in my view it is clear that statement given for the purpose of commencing or furthering criminal investigation will in all probability if prosecution ensues, ultimately be transmitted to an accused person and will be subject to scrutiny in criminal trial. [60] The MOU of May 15, 1996, undertook that statements by ""survivor"" were to be used only for the purpose of the process outlined in the MOU and were not to be released to the public without the prior written consent of the ""survivor"". The MOU, however, required the execution of release. By August, 1996, the prescribed form of release contemplated consent to the release of information to the R.C.M.P. (leading to public process as have set forth above) or for the purpose of entering the abuser's name in the child Abuse Register (the process as have set forth above). By 1996 the purposes of the statements were extended to include any action by the Province to recover from an insurance company or perpetrators actions potentially requiring disclosure. [61] The form of the release established by the Province's guidelines with respect to the use of statements was as have set forth above. That form of release reflected the purposes set forth in the Guidelines. therefore conclude that the personal information supplied by the various claimants accompanied by forms of releases by which claimants consented to any of the purposes leading to public process were not supplied in confidence as contemplated by s-s.(f). Section 20(2)(g): Keating says the information concerning his alleged abuses is ""inaccurate or unreliable"". The Attorney General has submitted for that reason the information ought not to be disclosed. If the information sought by Keating was intended to be put forward by him as reliable, the Attorney General's position would be acceptable. Keating, however, has asked for access to the information so that he would have right to correct it. That is precisely one of the purposes of the Act as set forth in s.2(a)(ii) which reads: The purpose of this Act is (a) to ensure that public bodies are fully accountable to the public by (ii) giving individuals right of access to, and right to correction of, personal information about themselves, ... Section 20(2)(h): As Mr. Keating has requested personal information about himself, any damage he may suffer to his personal reputation resulting from disclosure is irrelevant. Disclosure of accurate and truthful complaints made against Keating will not unfairly damage his reputation; nor will it unfairly damage the reputation of any truthful complainant. Section 20(3)(b): Was the personal information compiled and identifiable as part of an investigation into possible violation of law? Keating has not requested information from the R.C.M.P. Operation ""HOPE"" obtained statements and information from various claimants. That information retained solely by the R.C.M.P. is not the subject of this application. Information released by Operation ""HOPE"" of the R.C.M.P. was ""for the purpose of compensation and/or internal investigation"" by the Province of Nova Scotia. It was not compiled by the Justice Department as part of an investigation into possible violation of criminal law, but was, rather, compiled by the Province for its own purposes. The Province has cited Re Langley Township Bylaw Enforcement Records (2000) B.C. (Order 00-01) as authority to the effect that the application for information sought should be refused. With respect, this decision is not an authoritative, but perhaps more importantly, that application was for disclosure of information compiled for the specific purpose of law enforcement, but the application herein is for information sought for the purposes of the Province even though it may initially have been obtained by the R.C.M.P. for law enforcement purposes. That is, the initial purpose for the information at the time it was obtained by the R.C.M.P. was clearly for potential criminal prosecution and as such, would be protected. Nonetheless, when the R.C.M.P. obtained the necessary release from claimant and then provided information to the Province find that law enforcement protection was lost. Similarly, in Order P-395; Ministry of Culture and Communications, [1993] O.I.P.C. No. 5, the records sought were being used for criminal investigations and premature disclosure could have interfered with those investigations. But the application herein is for information and not necessarily records and, considering the length of time since the allegations were made do not consider this application to be premature. As well, distinguish between the present application for information as opposed to one for specific documents. also note that there is before me no evidence of imminence of criminal proceedings. Rather, Inspector Atkins made it abundantly clear that although the possibility of criminal proceedings has not been ruled out there is clearly no imminence of criminal proceedings. In Ministry of the Attorney General (Ont.); Order P-1603, [1998] O.I.P.C. No. 188, (a) the application was for specific files; (b) no releases were signed by the claimants and (c) there was no ""diminished expectation of privacy"" as is present herein as is evidenced by the releases signed. conclude for the various reasons have set forth above that information supplied by R.C.M.P. and authorized by claimants by the use of the form of release set forth above does not fall within the category of s.20(3)(b). Section 20(4): For the reasons have set forth above have concluded that the third parties (claimants) have consented to disclosure, as contemplated by s-s. (a). Section 15(1)(a) and (c): For the reasons set forth in my consideration of s.23(b), the disclosure of the information sought will not harm law enforcement and I am not convinced it will harm investigative techniques or procedures. Section 15(d): The disclosure sought herein will not reveal the identity of confidential source. The claimants, by virtue of the releases signed, have contemplated an eventual revelation. Section 15(1)(f): have not been persuaded that the information sought will interfere with prosecutorial discretion. Section 15(2)(b): The information sought herein is not part of law enforcement record and, as have said, do not understand how the information might expose any author to civil liability. Section 17(1)(e): The Province has not shown that this disclosure sought ""... could reasonably be expected to harm the financial or economic interests ... of the Government of Nova Scotia."" BURDEN OF PROOF Section 45 of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act reads: Burden of proof on head of public body 45 (1) At review or appeal into decision to refuse an applicant access to all or part of record, the burden is on the head of public body to prove that the applicant has no right of access to the record or part. Burden of proof on applicant (2) Where the record or part that the applicant is refused access to contains personal information about third party, the burden is on the applicant to prove that disclosure of the information would not be an unreasonable invasion of the third party's personal privacy. Burden of proof where third party (3) At review or appeal into decision to give an applicant access to all or part of record containing information that relates to third party, (a) In the case of personal information, the burden is on the applicant to prove that disclosure of the information would not be an unreasonable invasion of the third party's personal privacy; and (b) In any other case, the burden is on the third party to prove that the applicant has no right of access to the record or part. 1993, c.5, s.45 (1) The head of the public body has failed to prove that Keating has no right of access to records or parts of records which identify him as an abuser. (2) Keating has proved to my satisfaction that disclosure of the information sought, notwithstanding that it may be personal information about a third party, would not be an unreasonable invasion of the third party's personal privacy. (3) am satisfied that the third parties have failed to prove that Keating has no right of access to certain of the records or parts of the records as will identify below. CONCLUSIONS [62] refer again to Keating's request for information, as amended by his counsel. That is, he has requested ""information pertaining to me in the N.S. Government's program of 'Compensation to Victims of Institutional Abuse'"". emphasize that he has not requested specific documents, but rather, information; that request was for the following enumerated items: 1) the number and nature of allegations made against Mr. Keating and by whom those allegations were made; Elizabeth Mullaly set forth in her affidavit the type of information which may be available. She said, in para.5: 5. This complainant-focused database can be used to generate report on an individual employee. Using the employee code, the report that is produced will list the name of the complainant, the type of abuse alleged and the complainant's committal dates. There is column entitled 'NOA' which stands for ""Notice of Allegation"". If an ""S"" appears under that column, it indicates that Notice of Allegation was served on the employee in question. Where there is an ""I"", it indicates that the employee was interviewed with respect to the allegation. In the Appellant's case this information differs from the transcripts of interviews in the Program's files. The information available by this process should be disclosed to Keating. That is, Keating is to be given information of the number and nature of allegations made against him. He is to be given the names of those claimants who have made those allegations, provided they have signed the completed release forms as were specified above. 2) the specific times and dates of all the allegations made against Mr. Keating This information pertaining to those claimants who signed release as above is to be released to Keating. That is, Keating is to be informed of the times and date of the allegations referred to in (2). 3) the evidence collected in relation to investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; This information pertaining to claimants who have signed the release is to be released to Keating. 4) any documents created or used in the adjudicative process and the reasoning and deliberations of the review officers involved in the program with respect to claims against Mr. Keating; These documents are not of factual nature. They would appear likely to be merely expressions of opinions and conclusions and as such, they should not be released. 5) information on any action taken as result of the review officers' recommendations; Review officers' recommendations were merely opinions and should not be released. 6) the number and dollar amount of payouts made with respect to allegations against Mr. Keating; Ms. Mullaly said in her affidavit: 9. Using the information from FoxPro, which lists the complainants who made allegations against an individual, it is possible to manually produce report that will include the names of the claimants and the category and monetary award, if any, made within the Program. But then Ms. Mullaly continued: 10. The vast majority of claims are made against more than one employee and, consequently, the award, if any was made, was global in nature. The assessment process made no attempt to allocate any part of the award to or between individual employees. As result, there is no database that can produce record showing the amount of compensation tied to the allegations made against specific employee. Accordingly, when payouts or settlements were made in global manner involving Keating and others then no disclosure is required, where settlement or payout was made for actions attributed to Keating only, that he is entitled to that information. 7) whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed ... or unproven; This information concerning all claimants who have signed releases is to be supplied to Keating. 8) whether any allegations remain. This request is not sufficiently clear and need not be addressed. [63] In complying with this decision the Department of Justice is to take care not to identify by name any other alleged perpetrators of abuse. [64] Finally, this is an application for information and not for specific documents. If the parties encounter unforeseen difficulties in coming to form or order, will be prepared to hear them. [65] am prepared to receive written submissions from the parties with respect to the costs of this application as to entitlement and quantum.",d_2001nssc85.txt,"The applicant was aware that allegations of abuse had been made against him in an alternative dispute resolution process undertaken by the Province with respect to his former employment.

for the respondentsFIAT KYLE J. November 20, 2003 [1] By notice of motion of January 23, 2003, William Waynert, one of 29 nieces and nephews of Charles Carlson, has sought proof of the will of Charles Carlson in solemn form, questioning testamentary capacity, due execution of the will and raising the spectre of undue influence and coercion.
[2] Mr. Carlson died October 13, 2001, and his will dated November 11, 2000, was admitted to probate January 28, 2002.
By his will he bequeathed to four of his nieces his entire estate of approximately $291,000.00.
He was 88 at the time of his death.
When he signed his will, after dictating it to one of the executors, he seemed fully conscious of its content.
The will was witnessed by two friends.
Those attacking the will have not come forth with evidence which, if accepted at trial, would tend to negate testamentary capacity.","In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home.
The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses.
The wife appealed.
Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home;
the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice.
There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","[0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 5, 8, 9, 10, 2, 12]",432,"NOVA SCOTIA COURT OF APPEAL Citation: Goyetche v. Goyetche, 2006 NSCA 24 Date: 20060222 Docket: CA 252756 Registry: Halifax Between: Eileen Elizabeth Goyetche v. David Thomas Goyetche Respondent Judges: Bateman, Saunders Hamilton, JJ.A. Appeal Heard: February 14, 2006, in Halifax, Nova Scotia Held: Appeal allowed with costs and case remitted to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for a rehearing on an expedited basis, as per reasons of Saunders, J.A.; Bateman and Hamilton, JJ.A. concurring. Counsel: Peter Lederman, Q.C., for the appellant Alain Bégin, for the respondent Reasons for judgment: [1] Cross applications were filed by Mr. & Mrs. Goyetche in Supreme Court Chambers on April 13, 2005 and April 21, 2005 respectively: his seeking orders to terminate spousal support, to sell the matrimonial home, and to return to him certain personal belongings; and hers seeking orders to provide her with interim spousal support, as well as payment of support arrears and a reinstatement of her benefits under his medical insurance plan. [2] These two interlocutory applications were heard by Justice J. E. Scanlan on June 28, 2005. Both parties testified and were subject to cross-examination. In an oral decision at the conclusion of the hearing Justice Scanlan ordered, among other things, that the matrimonial home be put up for immediate sale; that Mr. Goyetche continue to pay Mrs. Goyetche $800.00 per month in spousal support terminating on June 1, 2006; that Mrs. Goyetche immediately return to Mr. Goyetche certain personal belongings; that Mr. Goyetche continue to pay the monthly mortgage payments on the matrimonial home, with all such payments made after June 28, 2005 credited to him from the sale proceeds of the home; and that the equity in the matrimonial home would be divided equally between the parties after first deducting legal fees and real estate commission. [3] Mrs. Goyetche appeals the decision claiming reversible error on the part of the Chambers judge in two respects: first, that he had no evidence before him to justify selling the matrimonial home and divide the proceeds of sale equally between the parties, and that he was influenced by irrelevant considerations relating to the behaviour of the appellant. [4] The standard of review we apply in cases such as this is well known. This court will not interfere with discretionary order, especially an interlocutory one such as arose here, unless wrong principles of law have been applied or patent injustice would result. See, for example, Exco Corporation Limited v. Nova Scotia Savings Loan et al (1983), 59 N.S.R. (2d) 331(C.A.); The Attorney General of Canada v. The Foundation Company of Canada Limited et al (1991)(C.A.); Minkoff v. Poole (1991), 1991 CanLII 2516 (NS CA), 101 N.S.R. (2d) 143 (C.A.); Temple v. Riley (2001), 2001 NSCA 36 (CanLII), 191 N.S.R. (2d) 87 (C.A.); and National Bank Financial Ltd. v. Mahoney, 2005 NSCA 139 (CanLII). [5] After carefully considering the record and the submissions of counsel, we are satisfied that this is case where we ought to intervene and set aside certain provisions of the order under appeal. [6] We need not address what the appellant has rather obliquely attempted to characterize as errors of law, but which might more accurately be described as too precipitously ordering the sale of the matrimonial home on an interlocutory basis without the benefit of professional appraisal or any compelling and urgent reason to do so; and complaining that the Chambers judge formed negative opinion of the appellant’s credibility from her admittedly frequent and expensive bingo playing habits. [7] Rather, the reason for our intervention is that when considering these cross-applications the course of action urged upon the judge by counsel resulted in patent injustice to the appellant, albeit quite unintended. [8] As the parties agreed and as the judge made clear in his decision, this case presented very unique set of circumstances. The appellant, Eileen Goyetche, was born on June 5, 1941. The petitioner/respondent, David Goyetche, was born on March 11, 1941. Each will turn 65 this year. They were married on August 18, 2001, but did not live together for the first 18 months due to Mr. Goyetche’s employment out of province. They separated on July 15, 2004. [9] Mr. Goyetche’s petition for divorce is dated January 10, 2005. Prior to the marriage Mrs. Goyetche owned her own home in Bible Hill and supported herself on social assistance disability benefits. Those benefits were terminated when the couple married. At that time the outstanding balance on her mortgage was approximately $33,500.00. Just prior to their marriage she transferred title to her home into both their names. They remortgaged the house, leaving new mortgage balance of close to $48,000.00. The borrowed money was used in renovation projects and household improvements including new dishwasher, carpeting, sunporch and garage. [10] Pursuant to an interim order, Mr. Goyetche was paying spousal support of $800 monthly. Mrs. Goyetche could not reside in the home without the maintenance continuing. Mr. Goyetche saw her continued living in the home as untenable, if it required him to continue support and mortgage payments indefinitely. He saw the sale of the home as solution to the dilemma. Mrs. Goyetche would not agree to sell the home. Matters were at an impasse. Their situation required judicial intervention. Since ceasing employment, Mr. Goyetche has maintained himself on modest pension and investment income. To this point he has had to live with relatives. Primary in Mr. Goyetche’s mind was to get his name off the title to the house and the mortgage, and see to the quick return of certain valuable personal belongings. Mrs. Goyetche’s troubles were equally pressing. She had been cut off her husband’s medical insurance coverage. She needed spousal support because her social assistance disability pension had been terminated when she married, and she wouldn’t receive any further income until she starts receiving old age security and CPP at age 65 on June 5, 2006. She wanted title to her house back. It was in this context that Mr. Goyetche applied for an interlocutory order that the home be sold. It was obvious to the judge and the parties that it would be impossible for Mrs. Goyetche to maintain the matrimonial home with its attendant monthly mortgage obligations without financial assistance. Evidently Justice Scanlan saw no alternative but to order its immediate sale. [11] The documentation and testimony at the hearing make it plain that three simple matters drove Mr. Goyetche’s application: first, he wanted to stop paying support to his wife; second, he wanted his name “off” the mortgage on the matrimonial home so that he could then finance his acquisition of new residence for himself; and finally, he wanted returned his surround sound stereo system and certain valuable collector’s items, including an antique knife and an autographed Mickey Mantle baseball. [12] There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the interlocutory notice filed by the petitioner on April 13, 2005. That request for relief only came up in an exchange between the judge and Mr. Goyetche’s lawyer during the hearing. This suggestion obviously troubled Justice Scanlan as can be seen in this extract during Mr. Goyetche’s direct examination when questioned by his own counsel: MR. BEGIN Q. you’re now caught up to date and you paid $800 per month up to and including the June of 2005, is that correct? A. November is when started paying $400. Before that, it was verbal agreement that we had made on paying the 800. had offered to pay the $800, plus $500 mortgage. And asked for my stereo and surround sound system, and as soon as received it, the $800 would continue. And was never offered any kind of concession on that. THE COURT So the order that was in place, though, as understand it, says $800 per month starting February the 14th, 2005. THE COURT But you’re saying you only paid 400 month? A. In November, yes. started in THE COURT Okay. A. in November when told her that as soon as received my equipment, that the $800 would be followed and paid up to date immediately. A. am well, I’m caught up with full payments on April, May and June, and still owe 400 from March and February. THE COURT Okay, that’s what thought you said in the first instance, so. MR. BEGIN So just February and March are 400, all the rest are $800, correct? A. Yes. Q. Okay. And on top of that, sir, you’re paying $535 month on mortgage? Q. And you’ve done it since separation. Q. And you’re also asking the Court today to return certain equipment? A. Yes. Q. And can you advise His Lordship what equipment or possessions you’re looking for? A. I’m looking for my stereo system that purchased in 1999 and my surround sound system. And on top of that, have an autographed Mickey Mantle baseball, safety award millennium silver dollar uncirculated, and collector an American collector knife that was absconded, and I’ve never been able to find it. THE COURT have the autographed baseball, collector’s knife. What else was it? And stereo and surround sound. MR. BEGIN millennium uncirculated silver dollar safety award. THE COURT Safety award silver dollar. And what else? Did miss something? A. have Bowe’s [(sic) BOSE] stereo system. THE COURT Yeah, have that. Q. In paragraph 13, you talk about not being able to afford home until you have your name off the mortgage in the matrimonial home. A. That’s correct. Q. Just tell His Lordship what you’ve done or what you’ve tried to do in relation to that? A. Well, didn’t know how stood as far as buying new furniture to relocate myself in an apartment building. was told by some people that if paid and bought all that, that would be included into marriage and would have to declare that as assets which would have to be divided. So ended up had uncles and aunts that were good enough to let me stay there until this problem had been solved so that could get on with my own life. And so I’m paying those people in lieu of apartment living or house buying. Q. But are you able to get mortgage, sir, on new home while your name is on the home on Guest Drive? A. would not be able to, no. don’t believe. THE COURT Counsel, aren’t we dealing there with division of matrimonial property. Are you asking me to make final division of property here today? And are you not asking me to do something which really don’t have authority to do and that is to have the bank release him from mortgage? MR. BEGIN We’re asking for an order to sell the home, My Lord, is what we’re asking for. Interestingly, when we were here before think it was Justice Cacchione Mr. Lederman said, Geez, you know, we basically what Your Lordship just said, aren’t we almost dealing with the divorce? And that’s why it was put over to today so we could deal with the various issues. Whatever happens today is pretty much the [order?] think my friend will confirm that. See most of the assets [inaudible] THE COURT Do have another application on file other than Okay, there are two applications. For the 13th and 21st then, of April. Okay, good. Sorry. MR. LEDERMAN Maybe if could just clarify what meant when made that comment. It struck me that when this application was brought, that what my friend was looking for basically was determination of all issues in dispute between these people [on an interim basis?] in Chambers’ Application. What asked Justice Cacchione to do was give us date for the divorce itself so we could deal with everything. But mean, guess it’s six of one and half-a-dozen of the other, but that was my decision. Still is. But we’re here so if we can deal with it, well, perhaps we should. Put this thing [inaudible] THE COURT No, the only concern had, counsel, was as was digging through the file, got to the application of April 21st and assumed that’s what we were proceeding on. And only when you raised did realize in terms of the history of the proceedings that there’s another application before the court. And assume that we’re hearing them both now. MR. BEGIN Yes, My Lord. THE COURT Okay. And that’s why asked, Are you not asking me to do something under the Matrimonial Property Act when it wasn’t really before me. But it is. And that’s pursuant to the April 13th application. MR. LEDERMAN That’s correct. THE COURT That was why asked the question. MR. LEDERMAN Okay. [Underlining mine] [13] The fact is that Mr. Goyetche did not file his application with any expressed intention to claim an equal division of the net proceeds realized upon sale of the matrimonial home. Yet this point has evolved into the principal issue on appeal. It obviously took Mrs. Goyetche’s counsel by surprise. In the portion of the transcript just quoted it would appear that Mr. Lederman resiled to the suggestion, without much protest that the judge address the asset division on the interlocutory application. He now candidly and properly admits that this was mistake on his part. We agree. To quote his factum Mr. Lederman gives this explanation at and 10: 9. It certainly struck me as odd and out of the ordinary to deal with division of property by way of an application that usually deals with interim relief only pending trial. 10. then went on to muse as follows: “But mean, guess it’s six of one and half dozen of the other, but that was my decision. Still is. But we’re here so if we can deal with it, well, perhaps we should.” In retrospect, that was not the appropriate reaction, and should have been more vociferous in my objections to proceeding. [Underlining mine] [14] In our respectful view, there was no evidence to warrant proceeding with the applications in the manner suggested by counsel. We disagree with Mr. Bégin’s submission at the hearing that the value of the house is irrelevant to the issue of its sale and that we ought to uphold the order directing its immediate sale, with the added direction that proceeds be kept in trust until each of their respective interests is determined. In our view, in the unique circumstances of this case, it is unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking the value of the house, and the parties’ individual contributions to that value into account when then classifying, quantifying and dividing matrimonial assets. Without knowing the value of the equity remaining in the house, it is simply impossible to say whether the amounts Mr. Goyetche feels he contributed (over and above the increased mortgage) were truly realized in any actual increased value to the property. This was acknowledged by the petitioner himself in cross-examination: Q. So what exactly is your position with regard to that house today? A. Well, don’t know what my position is. was told to get out of there on August 9th. A. I’ve increased the value of that home lot since we were married. Q. Okay, you realize she has no way of raising funds to get A. Well, that’s wish she did and then we wouldn’t be into this situation. Q. Yeah. Do you have any idea of what the increase in value has been? No, sir. I’m not into real estate; have no idea. would have to have professional go and appraise it. [Underlining mine] [15] At no time does Mr. Goyetche quantify the division of property he is looking for, let alone express the view that he is seeking an equal division of all matrimonial assets, or specifically half of the home equity. We see this in the following exchange between Mr. Goyetche and Mr. Lederman during cross-examination: Q. Okay, well, are you prepared to sign the title back to her? A. Well, I’m prepared to sign the title over back to her providing get some of the money that put into it when we were married. [16] At one point in his judgment the Chambers judge writes: If the property is worth $170,000.00 as Mr. Goyetche suggested We can find no substantiation for such sum in the record. At one point in his evidence, Mr. Goyetche opined that the house might be worth $150,000.00, but its actual value was never properly established. [17] It is unfortunate that the hearing went off track with an approach to the proceedings taken at the behest of counsel. This ultimately led to an obvious and immediate injustice to the appellant. The fair division of property between the parties, including the matrimonial home, should only be decided upon proper record, with all assets of the parties considered and when both Mr. Mrs. Goyetche have been given the opportunity to present their evidence. This should at the very least include professional appraisal; an accurate accounting of mortgage payments with the current balance shown; documentation verifying the renovations and improvements made to the home (with available receipts); and evidence concerning Mr. Mrs. Goyetche’s respective contributions to those efforts, bearing in mind the “presumption” favouring an equal division pursuant to sections 12 13 of the Matrimonial Property Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 275. [18] We will intervene so as to correct a patent injustice. However, we wish to ensure, as best we can in the circumstances, that proceedings are not delayed and that the parties move with all dispatch to arrange for an expedited rehearing, should that be necessary. [19] We would therefore: (i) allow the appeal; (ii) temporarily vacate ¶ 1 Justice Scanlan’s order dated July 19, 2005 so as to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue, consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home. This might include, for example, Mrs. Goyetche arranging for refinancing of her equity in the home in order to settle payment of Mr. Goyetche’s interest. Should those efforts prove unsuccessful, of Justice Scanlan’s order will be restored and reactivated effective May 30, 2006, thereby authorizing the immediate sale of the matrimonial home without delay or impediment by either party (for clarity, that provision is reproduced herewith); 1. THAT the matrimonial home at 70 Guest Drive shall be put up for immediate sale. THAT Eileen Goyetche shall cooperate fully with the real estate agent for the purpose of permitting the real estate agent to prepare the home for listing, and Eileen Goyetche will further cooperate fully with the real estate agent for all showings. (iii) direct that Mr. Goyetche’s obligation to continue paying the mortgage on the matrimonial home shall continue, under this Order, only until the earlier of either the sale of the matrimonial home, or June 2, 2006 (being the day after the June mortgage payment is due). This provision does not, however, alter the legal responsibilities either party may have to the bank under their mortgage, for payment of the monthly mortgage amounts or the principal secured; (iv) strike of the said order (for clarity, that provision is reproduced herewith); 8. THAT subject to the previous paragraphs, the equity in the matrimonial home shall be divided equally between both parties after the payment of legal fees and real estate commission. (v) direct that the case be remitted to the Supreme Court on an expedited basis for rehearing and proper determination (should such rehearing be necessary) based on these directions, which hearing should include final determination on the apportionment of all assets of the parties; (vi) direct that on any final division of assets the judge shall be at liberty but not obliged to include the value of the personal items already determined to belong to Mr. Goyetche, no appeal having been taken with respect to that allocation. [20] We see no reason why the matter could not be heard again by Justice Scanlan, should his schedule permit it. Findings of credibility were entirely within his province and do not require any comment from this Court, should he choose to take up the case again. They may have no bearing at all on the matters yet to be decided. The facts and history of the case are obviously well known to him and it might accelerate these proceedings and bring about more timely conclusion if he were able to hear it. Otherwise the matter could be directed to any other member of the Supreme Court. [21] In the unusual circumstances of this appeal, Mr. Goyetche shall have costs in the amount of $1,500 inclusive of disbursements, in any event of the cause, but not payable until the earlier of either the sale of the matrimonial home, or final settlement of the issues outstanding in this matter.

[2] Introduction: David Raphael McGean died intestate on May 3, 2007 in North Sydney, Nova Scotia. The Applicant, Theresa McGean, and the Respondent applied for Grant of Administration by application, dated May 4, 2007. By Grant of Administration, issued by the Court of Probate for Nova Scotia, the Applicant Theresa McGean, and the Respondent were appointed Co-Administratrices of the Estate of David Raphael McGean. [3] The intestate, was employed by Marine Atlantic Inc. for approximately thirty-one (31) years. During that period he contributed to pension plan, which was valued following his death in June, 2007 by Marine Atlantic Inc. at two hundred eighty-three thousand two hundred thirty-seven dollars ($283,237.00). [4] Marine Atlantic Inc. determined that the Respondent is spouse within the meaning of the Pension Plan for Employees of Marine Atlantic Inc. and the Pension Benefits Standards Act R.S.C. 1985, c.32 (2nd Supp.), and therefore, began paying survivor benefits to her. As result of the survivor benefits being paid to the Respondent, the Estate received no monies from Marine Atlantic Inc. The Applicants contend that the pension should have been paid to the Estate, rather than the survivor benefits to the Respondent. It is the Applicant’s position that the Respondent was not spouse, within the meaning of the legislation and plan, and is therefore not entitled to the survivor benefits. As such, the Applicants believe that the Estate should commence an action in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia against Marine Atlantic Inc. and the Respondent for payment into the Estate of the pension plan entitlement earned by the Intestate, and for reimbursement by the Respondent of the amounts already paid to her. [5] The Applicants further contend that the Respondent is in position of direct conflict. The continuing payment of the survivor benefits is an immediate benefit to her, which would be lessened if it were to be paid to the Estate and divided amongst all of the heirs. Unless the Respondent agreed that the pension funds should be paid into the Estate and divided amongst the heirs, the Respondent, as Adminstratrix of the Estate, would be required to bring action against herself, in her personal capacity. [6] Based on the foregoing, the Applicants believe that the Respondent should be removed as Adminstratrix of the Estate. Then the Estate could pursue claim for payment of the Marine Atlantic pension into the Estate. [7] Facts: The Intestate resided at North Sydney, Nova Scotia, at the time of his death. The Intestate had two children, the Applicants, and was separated from his wife, the Respondent. The Respondent is not the biological mother of the Applicants. The Intestate and the Respondent had been separated from one another for approximately twelve (12) years at the time of his death. The Intestate had no common law spouse. [8] The Intestate was employed by Marine Atlantic Inc. from January 1975 until he retired in October 2006. The Intestate was collecting the pension from Marine Atlantic Inc. at the time of his death. Marie Atlantic Inc. has indicated that the total lump sum value of the pension, as of May 31, 2007 was, as was noted above, two hundred eighty-three thousand two hundred thirty seven dollars ($283,237.00). [9] As noted, the Intestate died on May 3, 2007. The Administratrices were unable to locate Will of the Intestate and therefore filed for Grant of Administration. The Applicant, David McGean, did not apply for the Grant, as he is resident in Kellowna, British Columbia. [10] As also noted, Marine Atlantic Inc. has commenced payment of the pension survivor benefit to the Respondent. Marine Atlantic Inc. has refused to make any payment to the Estate. [11] Legislation: The New Act: The Applicants rely upon the Probate Act, S.N.S. 2000, c. 31. Section 61 provides in part: “61(1) On the application of any person, the court may remove personal representative where the court is satisfied that removal of the personal representative would be in the best interests of those persons interested in the estate and, without limited the generality of the foregoing, if the court is satisfied that (a) the personal representative has not complied with an order of the court; (b) the personal representative (I) is neglecting to administer or settle the estate, (ii) is wasting the estate” (Emphasis added) [12] The Application must fail. It is clear that the removal of Joan McGean as personal representative is not in the “best interests of those persons interested in the estate”. It would only be so if the intended lawsuit with Marine Atlantic were feasible. It is not. [13] Section 7.1.1(a) of the Pension Plan reads:“7.1.1 Except as provided under Section 7.1.2 and Section 7.1.3, on the death of the pensioner, survivor benefits shall be paid(a) equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the member’s pension to the person who was his spouse at the time of retirement, during the spouse’s lifetime and to the spouse’s estate as a lump sum on the basis of the commuted value of the payments for the remainder of a five-year period from the date of the member’s retirement if his surviving spouse dies within that period.” (Emphasis added) [14] “Spouse” is defined in Section 1.32 which reads: “Spouse means person of the opposite or same sex who is cohabiting with the member in conjugal relationship at the relevant time, having so cohabited with the member for at least one year or, if there is no such person, person who is married to the member or who is party to void marriage with the member, except that prior to July 1, 1999. ... Prior to December 31, 1986, spouse meant person whom the member was married prior to his date of termination and at least one year prior to his death or retirement.” (Emphasis added) [15] Joan McGean and the Intestate never divorced. They separated in December 1996. Consent Order dated December 10, 1996 obliged the intestate to make payments in lieu of spousal support. He continued to make such payments until two months before his death. [16] On July 18, 2002, the Intestate signed an affidavit of status on deed which reads: “That am the spouse of Joan McGean and have no other spouse or, with respect to the within property, any former domestic partner with the rights contemplated by Section 55 of the Vital Statistics Act, or any former spouse with rights under the Matrimonial Property Act.” [17] Theresa McLean says that, prior to his death, the Testator had made arrangements with Marine Atlantic Inc. to designate himself as single. There is no documentary support for this assertion. Even if there were, the Intestate took no steps to change the Respondent’s status in law, that is, he never divorced the Respondent. [18] There is no question but that Joan McGean was the spouse of the Intestate at the time of his death. As such, she is entitled to be paid survivor benefits pursuant to the plan. Those are the terms that bound the intestate. They now bind his Estate. There is no reason to remove Joan McGean as personal representative of the Estate because there is no feasible action for the Estate to pursue. [19] I am therefore dismissing the application. Jean McGean failed to respond to the notice on the original scheduled date for hearing. She therefore necessitated second date. The Applicants needlessly incurred costs on the original date because of Joan McGean’s failure to respond. Joan McGean is entitled to costs for the second day but these are offset by the expense she caused the Applicants on the first date. The parties therefore will each bear their respective costs. Order accordingly.",d_2008nssc145.txt,"The intestate's biological child, who was one of the personal representatives of the estate, wished to sue the intestate's former employer to have the pension to which he was entitled at the time of his death paid into the estate.

GORDON, [1] John Labuick sues Nancy and Tom Sykes in an amended claim that was issued the 30th of August 2012. In turn each side brought an application to have the opposing parties’ counsel disqualified. Both applications were successful and therefore the parties are currently self-represented. case management conference pursuant to The Small Claims Act was conducted and adjourned to be continued in front of Judge Kovatch on October 1, 2013. At that time the Sykes indicated they were going to be making an application to have portions of the action of Mr. Labuick struck. In fact the Sykes did file notice of motion dated September 18, 2013 asking for this relief. hearing date was set for June 17, 2014 and this decision comes as result of that hearing. [2] am satisfied that the Sykes’ application is based on the following grounds: 1) that the Labuick claim is frivolous or vexatious and that he has no legal right to bring the application; and 2) that the Labuick claim does not disclose reasonable cause of action. [3] Mr. Labuick defends this application stating he has legitimate cause of action. He states that part of his action is based on overhanging trees from the Sykes’ yard into his yard and as result, he has suffered damages and should be compensated. [4] The case law is clear that both the above noted remedies should be used sparingly. Litigants have the right for proper claim to be heard. There is difference in proof for each type of application. In determining whether claim is frivolous or vexatious, the Court can consider the merits of the claim and the adequacy of the claim. In determining whether the claim discloses no reasonable cause of action, the Court only needs to consider adequacy. This is illustrated in Custom Cycle v. Honda Canada, 2007 SKQB 427 (CanLII). [5] This claim of Mr. Labuick raises the issue of whether this is case involving the law of private nuisance. Private nuisance is generally described as unreasonable interference with an occupier’s use and enjoyment of their land (see St. Lawrence Cement Inc. v. Barrette, 2008 SCC 64 (CanLII)). At paragraph 77, the Court stated: At common law, nuisance is field of liability that focuses on the harm suffered rather than on prohibited conduct (A. M. Linden and B. Feldthusen, Canadian Tort Law (8th ed. 2006), at p. 559; L. N. Klar, Tort Law (2nd ed. 1996), at p. 535). Nuisance is defined as unreasonable interference with the use of land (Linden and Feldthusen, at p. 559; Klar, at p. 535). Whether the interference results from intentional, negligent or non-faulty conduct is of no consequence provided that the harm can be characterized as nuisance (Linden and Feldthusen, at p. 559). The interference must be intolerable to an ordinary person (p. 568). This is assessed by considering factors such as the nature, severity and duration of the interference, the character of the neighbourhood, the sensitivity of the plaintiff’s use and the utility of the activity (p. 569). The interference must be substantial, which means that compensation will not be awarded for trivial annoyances (Linden and Feldthusen, at p. 569; Klar, at p. 536). [6] The tort of nuisance has been considered by various courts in the context of trees. In Pook v. Rowswell, 2005 SKPC 110 (CanLII), Judge Meekma held that an overhanging tree can constitute private nuisance but any liability would require causation in damages (paras. 14 to 16). In Pook, the plaintiff was not successful in proving causation because there was no evidence that the tree was ever in contact with the shed in damaging way. [7] In Wallace v. Joughin, 2014 BCPC (CanLII), one of the plaintiff’s claims was for nuisance in that the defendant’s trees grew in the plaintiff’s air space and that debris from those trees landed in the plaintiff’s yard and that the trees blocked the natural light. [8] The plaintiff testified that branches up to three feet long had broken off the tree and damaged her house during wind storm and that fir needles, cones and small branches resulted in extra maintenance to the yard and reduced the life span of various items such as an art studio roof, wire fence and gutters. The defendant argued that the trees “are part of the natural characteristic” of the neighbourhood predating the plaintiff’s purchase of the property and that “having regard for the requisite elements and considerations to be applied ... the claimant has not been able to demonstrate that the fir trees amount to nuisance”. It is noted there was significant amount of evidence from expert reports relating to fir tree growth patterns and the effect it can have on one’s health. The Court held at paragraphs 240 and 241: [240] Objectively, one who chooses to live in semi-rural environment where there are significant number of trees must expect to have both the benefits and advantages of those trees and some of the minor inconveniences that naturally accompany them. Those minor inconveniences will include blowing fallen maple leaves in the fall, blossoming Japanese cherry trees in the spring and the year round rain of needles from the coniferous trees, many of which may end up in the house gutters. It will even include disruption of personal goal to achieve perfect lawn because of its natural incompatibility with the surrounding trees. [241] Taking into account all of the Sutherland elements and considerations as they relate to this case and the Claimant’s proffered complaints, my conclusion is that the Claimant has failed to establish what can be regarded as nuisance, that is “an inconvenience materially interfering with the ordinary physical comfort of human existence, not merely according to elegant or dainty modes and habits of living, but according to plain and sober and simple notions.” [9] In another case called Yates v. Fedirchuk, 2011 ONSC 5549 (CanLII), the plaintiff claimed damages in nuisance for root damage from the neighbour’s tree to her pool. Ordering that the trees be felled was found to be “contrary to the norms that believe generally govern neighbourhood relations in Ottawa in the 21st century” the judge held. The Court also quoted the Supreme Court of Canada case of 114957 Canada Ltee. v. Hudson, 2001 SCC 40 (CanLII), [2001] S.C.R. 241 at paragraph 1, that held environmental protection is fundamental value in Canadian society. [10] As result of reviewing the principles enunciated in these cases, conclude that nuisance claims relating to trees result in damages where the effects are outside whatever is reasonably expected based on community standards. As rule damages are awarded where roots damage property or where tree branches harm property either by falling onto it, breaking it or hanging over it and causing damage. Damages are not awarded for trivial or minor interference which is in keeping with community expectations unless special circumstances justify it. For example, in Olah v. Cadillac Fairview Corp., [1990] S.J. No. 344, the plaintiff sued for interference with the use and enjoyment of their home because dust and dirt blew onto their yard. This would not normally be nuisance but in this particular case it was, as it was substantially larger than normal being from shopping mall with large block of land between the plaintiff’s home and the mall. [11] Mr. Labuick’s claim as stated in his amended claim involves two areas of concern: 1) seed pods, fuzz and other debris fall from the trees in significant amounts during the summer months from the defendant’s trees; and 2) branches from the defendant’s trees grow over the property line and intrude into the Labuick space. [12] Mr. Labuick says as result of these two problems, he has had to do more cleaning and maintenance than would otherwise be required and that debris from large overhanging trees has caused the filtration system in his pool to be clogged lowering its life span and increasing service requirements and he further goes on to say that debris from the trees generally have damaged his three air conditioning units which also required increased service and maintenance. [13] In the June 17, 2014 hearing of this application, Mr. Labuick also alleged that one of the air conditioners had burnt out because it was plugged with fuzz from the defendant’s trees. [14] The Sykes argued that the pleadings should be struck. Their main argument it appears to be is that the claim is frivolous or vexatious although in paragraph of their dispute note they ask that the plaintiff’s claim be struck as there is no reasonable likelihood of success under the tort of nuisance. There is also other references in their documentation such as “unwarranted court claim” and “damage to anything is hardly an issue”. Therefore given the fact that the Sykes are the applicants in this application and are self-represented litigants, am going to consider both requests. [15] summary of the Sykes’ argument is as follows: (1) The community expects that debris from trees will blow onto other yards. The Sykes claim the trees in question are well-established and were there when they purchased the house in 1988. (2) The community plan for Moose Jaw supports urban trees and that their particular neighbourhood is generally in favour of them. (3) It is known and accepted that debris from trees will be picked up by the wind. (4) There are many other trees within the residential area so it is impossible to demonstrate that the debris that Mr. Labuick complains about is from the Sykes’ trees only. (5) There could be other reasons for the damage to the pool filter such as grass clippings, overuse, shedding dogs and the trees in the Labuicks’ yard. (6) Any damage to the air conditioning unit is overstated and could equally be due to overuse. [16] The Sykes say at this time there is no overhanging trees onto the Labuick property. The Sykes say there was branch hanging approximately 30 feet up but it was trimmed back in May of this year. [17] The law is clear that any overhanging trees or branches could constitute private nuisance. Whether damages can be claimed or would be awarded for this is question to be proven and decided at trial. [18] I am prepared to strike the portion of the Labuick claim with respect to damages from debris falling from the Sykes’ property onto the Labuick property. Even if Mr. Labuick could prove that the debris in his yard is solely from the Sykes’ trees, this would not be sufficient. am prepared to take judicial notice of the fact that communities such as Moose Jaw have trees, wind blows and blows all sorts of debris into other people’s yards. This is something people are expected to live with. It is part of urban life. There is nothing in the pleadings to suggest that the burden on Mr. Labuick is greater than expected for the community he lives in. The issue is there is no remedy even if were to accept that Mr. Labuick proved the fluff or debris in his pool was solely from the Sykes’ trees. [19] am also prepared to strike this aspect of the claim on the grounds it is frivolous and vexatious when considering the merits in the context of community standards. [20] Mr. Labuick has also asked for injunctive relief. Under s. of The Small Claims Act, the jurisdiction of the Court is specifically set out as follows: 3(1) Subject to subsection (7), this Act applies, whether or not the Crown is party to the action, to any claim or counterclaim for: (a) debt or damages; (b) recovery of personal property; (c) specific performance or rescission of an agreement relating to personal property or services; or (d) relief from opposing claims to personal property. (2) Subject to subsections (3), (4) and (7) but notwithstanding clause 2(o) of The Saskatchewan Insurance Act, actions by or against an insurer may be brought pursuant to this Act in any situation where there is disagreement between the insured and the insurer. (3) If the contract of insurance or The Saskatchewan Insurance Act requires an appraisal before there can be any recovery, the procedures for an appraisal set out in the contract or The Saskatchewan Insurance Act, including, where applicable, submission to an umpire, must be completed before an action may be brought. (4) If the contract of insurance or The Saskatchewan Insurance Act allows but does not require an appraisal, an action may be brought whether or not the procedures for an appraisal set out in the contract or The Saskatchewan Insurance Act have been completed. (5) For the purposes of subsection (3), “requires an appraisal” includes situation in which contract of insurance or The Saskatchewan Insurance Act provides an insured or an insurer with the right to require an appraisal and the insured or insurer has exercised that right. (6) Subject to subsection (7) but notwithstanding section 61 of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act, an action to recover benefits or insurance money may be brought pursuant to this Act. (7) The maximum amount that may be claimed or the maximum value of the personal property or services with respect to which relief may be sought is the amount prescribed as the monetary limit. (8) In determining whether claim or counterclaim exceeds the monetary limit, the amount or value is to be calculated without taking into consideration interest or costs. (9) This Act does not apply to claim for libel, slander, malicious arrest, malicious prosecution or false imprisonment. [21] Section 9(1) of The Queen’s Bench Act R.S.S. 1998, c.S-7 states: 9(1) The court has original jurisdiction throughout Saskatchewan, with full power and authority to consider, hear, try and determine actions and matters. [22] Section 65 of The Queen’s Bench Act refers to the granting of injunctive relief. In Northern Light Arabians v. Sapergia, 2011 SKPC 151 (CanLII), the Court held that an injunction ordering that fence be built was “beyond the authority of this Court” (para. 39). [23] Therefore I am prepared to strike out the request that an injunction be issued ordering the trees be removed. This is clearly a remedy this Court has no jurisdiction to grant. [24] In summary, the Labuick amended claim can proceed to trial which will be limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees from the Sykes’ property onto the Labuick property and whether these trees invade the Labuick air space. Whether there are branches overhanging into Labuick’s yard is triable issue and if Labuick is successful, monetary damages can be awarded. [25] Therefore the matter will be adjourned to resume the case management conference in front of Judge Kovatch on October 2, 2014 at 10:30 a.m. Costs shall remain for the trial judge.",d_2014skpc145.txt,"The Court allowed the application in part.

The Director’s application was brought pursuant to s. 7 of the Act on the ground that the vehicle had been used in criminal activity.
II.
background [2] Ms. Brinkman and the respondent Aaron Tropeau are common-law spouses.
[3] The vehicle in question (the “Vehicle”) is a 2010 Ford Transit Cargo Van.
Ms. Brinkman purchased it in 2010, with money received from her father’s estate.
Beginning in January of 2012, she and Mr. Tropeau used it to haul items on an on-call basis.
The business averaged $3,000 in profit every month.
[4] In March of 2012, Mr. Tropeau was seen removing copper material from the back of a truck.
As a witness approached the scene, Ms. Brinkman (who was sitting in the Vehicle) called out a warning to Mr. Tropeau.
[5] A second incident occurred on March 29, 2012.","The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act.
The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.'
The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures.
The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product.
For the plaintiff,
that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 12, 10, 7, 11, 9, 8, 0]",484,"CANADA PROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIA 1992 S.H. 72115 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA TRIAL DIVISION BETWEEN: CONTINENTAL SEAFOODS LIMITED and THE MINISTER OF FINANCE Respondent HEARD: before the Honourable Mr. Justice F. B. W. Kelly, Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Trial Division September 5, 1991 in Chambers. DECISION: September 5, 1991 COUNSEL: Mr. Harvey Morrison, Esq., for the applicant Mr. Duncan Beveridge, Esq., for the respondent DECISION RELEASED: March 25, 1992 CANADA PROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIA 1992 S.H. 72115 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA TRIAL DIVISION BETWEEN: CONTINENTAL SEAFOODS LIMITED Appellant and THE MINISTER OF FINANCE Respondent KELLY, J.: (Orally) This is an appeal pursuant to s. 19 of the Health Services Tax Act, R.S.N.S. 1967, c. 126 in respect of a decision of the Provincial Tax Commission to cancel a claim for a refund of health services tax by the applicant, Continental Seafoods Ltd. The Act has since been significantly amended by R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 198. Continental had applied to the Commission for a refund of the tax paid on certain refrigeration equipment which was installed in a new facility for pickled whole herring in Shelburne, Nova Scotia. This product was mainly to be supplied on contract to the Soviet Union. The contract contained stringent quality specifications governing the processing of this product which included a phase where the pickling occurs in a cooler facility for 28 to 45 days at a strictly controlled temperature of 0ºC to ‑2ºC. The new facility comprises roughly 38,000 square feet and includes three large cold rooms of similar capacity and dimension. The plant was intended to be used mainly to produce barrels of pickled salted herring for sale to Russia and eastern European countries. The plant was to be used both for production and also for storage of products produced elsewhere by Continental or its related companies. The cold storage rooms can be used for (a) refrigerator rooms for temperature control of the processing of pickled herring (b) cold storage of pickled herring or variety of products, and ©) storage of other frozen products. In fact, one of the cold rooms was used only for storage of frozen products that belonged to Continental and related companies and unrelated companies on fee for storage basis. When pickled herring is not being processed, the refrigeration equipment is used to provide air conditioning and cold storage capacity for Continental or these companies. In 1988 Continental contracted with J. H. Lock Sons Limited to furnish the labour, materials and equipment for the refrigeration system in the plant. The contract price of $550,467 included all provincial and federal government sales tax. Germain Mechanical and Electrical Limited acted as subcontractor for J. H. Lock to complete the contract work on the refrigeration system. It also contracted directly with Continental for various electrical and mechanical plumbing tasks. Health services tax was paid by Germain and J. H. Lock or subcontractors used by them on material and equipment used in relation to the construction of the cold storage processing plant at Shelburne. In early 1989, Continental applied for refund of health services tax paid on the refrigeration equipment in the amount of $58,791, which included work done by the two contractors, J. H. Lock and Germain. The Provincial Tax Commission advised Continental that the refund claim had been ""cancelled as contract was for New Cold Storage System which does not qualify for exemption under s. 10(1)(h)(I)"". Relevant parts of this section read as follows: 10(1) The following classes of tangible personal property are specifically exempted from the provisions of this Act: nan (h) machinery and apparatus and parts thereof which are to be used or which are used in the manufacture or production of goods for sale; (i) materials consumed or expended in the manufacture or production of goods for sale; (j) goods purchased for the purpose of being processed, fabricated, or manufactured into, or incorporated into goods for the purpose of sale; Section 1(ca) provides as follows: (ca) 'manufacture or production' means the transformation or conversion of raw or prepared material into different state or form from that in which it originally existed as raw or prepared material but does not include production or processing; Thus, under s. 10(1)(h) and (I) of the Act machinery and materials used in the 'manufacture or production' of goods for sale are exempt from taxation. Continental forwarded Notice of Objection relating to the cancellation to the Provincial Tax Commissioner which stated in part: In further support of our submission, we refer you to the Northland Fisheries decision, dated November 25, 1986 from which we quote ""Raw fish must be protected from spoilage. Without the insulated boxes"" (or in the instant case, refrigeration equipment) the fish would be transformed or converted into rather unmarketable product. Where it is necessary to move the raw fish from one area to another, these insulated boxes"" or in the instant case, the refrigeration equipment ""are necessary apparatus used to produce saleable product. nan In closing, it is readily understood that some of this refrigeration equipment capacity will serve as cold storage only while the main purpose for the expansion was to provide for the herring pickling operation and other curing and drying of salt fish as referred to in Mr. MacLean's letter. This firm did expect some reduction in the total amount claimed but however did not expect complete cancellation thereof. May we therefore suggest as compromise that the client is prepared to accept 50% safety margin to ensure that your Division has no unacceptable revenue loss. The Commissioner allowed the objection in part and indicated that rebate of $14,467.43 would be paid to Continental. This decision was based on disallowing any exemption for the mechanical plumbing and electrical services provided by Germain and by determining that only portion of the refrigeration capacity was used for production purposes. The Commissioner allowed 35% of the $41,335.50 tax paid by J. H. Lock to be rebated in the amount of $14,467.43. An appeal from this decision was made to the Minister of Finance pursuant to s. 18(5) of the Act in July of 1989 and the Minister discussed this appeal in decision dated January 26, 1990. This decision concludes as follows: Consideration of the exemption from health services tax claimed by the Appellant in respect of the equipment in the context of clauses 10(1)(h) and 1(ca) of the Act, as interpreted by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in Northland Fisheries Limited v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Finance), leads me to conclude that in order to be eligible for exemption from health services tax pursuant to clause 10(1)(h) of the Act, machinery and equipment must be used in the actual transformation or conversion of the product actually being produced for sale. Machinery or apparatus used prior or subsequent to that actual transformation or conversion is not eligible for the tax exemption. The function described by the Appellant of the equipment cannot, in my opinion, be reasonably said to be fully part of the manufacture or production of its product so as to bring it within, subject to the definition in clause 1(ca), the exemption available in clause 10(1)(h) of the Act. The appeal will therefore be dismissed and the assessment for health services tax, as varied by the Provincial Tax Commissioner, upheld. The appellant contends that the Minister and the Commissioner were incorrect in not allowing the exemption for the refrigeration equipment in full. The submission is that it was inappropriate to apportion the tax to be refunded if the equipment is exempt and is used in any degree in the manufacturing process. In Silver Spoons Desserts Enterprises Ltd. v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Finance) (1989), 89 N.S.R. (2d) 363; 227 A.P.R. 363 (S.C.A.D.) Jones, J.A. reviewed the history of the legislation and particularly s. 10(1)(h)(I) and (j) and noted that the exemption does not depend on the degree to which the goods are used in the manufacturing process. At p. 375 he noted with approval the comments of Jones, J. in Forest Products Terminal Corporation Ltd. v. New Brunswick (1985), 58 N.B.R. (2d) 371, at p. 380: Once it has been established that the machinery or apparatus is 'used directly in the process of manufacture or production, this is sufficient. The use of the machinery or apparatus need not be exclusively in the manufacturing or production process nor does it matter the percentage of use that it attributed to such process as opposed to other processes'.

In Northland Fisheries Limited v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Finance) (1986), 77 N.S.R. (2d) 361; 191 A.P.R.361, Maclntosh, J. stated at pp. 364‑365: If it is the aim of the Legislature to narrow the scope of tax exemptions in this area, it is incumbent upon it to state its aim with clarity. Elimination of the word 'process' by the 1982 amendment tends to accomplish this aim to some degree. 'process' normally refers to some continuous operation and includes an operation which is merely incidental to the main purpose which is being served. (per Stroud's Judicial Dictionary (4th Ed.), p. 2130.) nan Despite its inept drafting, the definition section tends to exempt from taxation only that machinery or apparatus involved in the actual transformation or conversion of the material. Machinery or apparatus used prior or subsequent to this period of 'manufacture or production' is now, by virtue of the said 1982 amendment, not tax exempt. On the facts before him, Macintosh, J. held that insulated fish boxes were ""involved in the active transformation"" of fish because they were used to transform or convert the fish into different state; from perishable to non‑perishable. Here the use of the cold rooms was clearly part of the pickling process. The specification of the Russian contracts required that a significant part of the processing occur in a controlled almost freezing temperature, making it necessary for the use of refrigeration equipment. The use of a cold room in the process performed a function that was part of the manufacture or production of the product, pickled herring. With respect, the Minister was wrong in concluding otherwise. The Minister also upheld the Commissioner's decision to apportion the tax thus appearing to imply that the refrigeration facility was, at least in part, exempt from tax. The essence of the Commissioner's decision was that as part of the refrigeration process only was used in the manufacture or production of the pickled herring, he could exempt that portion and tax the rest. It would appear that the practice of apportionment of this kind has been rejected in Silver Spoons Desserts Enterprises Limited v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Finance), supra, (1989), 89 N.S.R. (2d) 363; 227 A.P.R. 363 (S.C.A.D.) which determined there is no power under the Act for the Commissioner to assess tax on prorated basis based on the extent the machinery or equipment is used in the manufacturing or production process. It would thus appear that even though only part of the refrigeration equipment was used in this process, all of it is exempt. Counsel for the Minister argued at the hearing that Continental was not entitled to an exemption for the refrigeration unit. The submission is that Continental paid no Health Services tax in that it was directly paid by the two contractors, J. H. Lock and Germain. The thrust of the submission was that the contracting companies were the ""purchaser"" under the Act and therefore they, not Continental, were the only parties with the right to seek refund. As authority for this proposition referencewas made to Installations Electriques, G. Bradley Ltee. v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General) (1987), 77 N.S.R. (2d) 327; 191 A.P.R.. 327 (S.C.T.D.); leave to appeal refused 89 N.S.R. (2d) 270. The applicant protests that this is new matter, not presented by the parties or considered by the Commissioner or the Minister, and is not proper consideration on appeal. Section 19 deals with the right of appeal from the decision of the Minister and the powers of the court on appeal are provided in 19(4); (4) The judge shall hear the appeal and the evidence adduced before him by the appellant and Her Majesty in summary manner, and shall decide the matter of the appeal. Upon the request made to the judge by any party to the appeal, the hearing may be held in camera. It is argued by the respondent that s. 19(4) should be applied in liberal way to allow additional grounds to be argued at this stage. This is judicial proceeding where the legislation does not provide much by way of procedural requirements and the practice of counsel is to accommodate the deficiencies of the Act to ensure as much procedural fairness as possible. In the absence of consent from the other party, do not feel it is appropriate in the circumstances to allow party to raise new ground not submitted to or argued before the Minister or Provincial Tax Commissioner. The information that was before the Commissioner and the Minister was the same information presented to this court. There well may be appropriate circumstances where the court might allow such new submission, but do not feel this is one. See Ponnamma v. Arumogam, [1905] A.C. 383 (C.P.C.), National Telephone Company Limited v. Postmaster General, [1913] A.C. 546 (H.L.) and United Dominions Trust Ltd., [1954] W.L.R. 1345 (M.R.). In the latter case Evershed M.R. stated at p. 1351; As matter of principle, the Court of Appeal has always been strict in applying the rule that an appellant from county court, unless the other party consents, cannot be allowed in this court to raise new point of law not raised below. After all, the county court is intended to serve litigants of relatively small means, and it is not in accordance with the public interest that party, who has fought case in county court and been defeated, should then come to this court and raise in this court new point, and put his case in an entirely different way as matter of law and so make the other party, hitherto successful, litigate the matter again at the risk of having to pay the costs not only below but in this court. The result of my findings above is that the decision of the Provincial Tax Commissioner, as upheld by the Minister, to allow refund on the refrigeration equipment is approved, but that the tax paid should not have been apportioned based on the use of the equipment in production. This would mean that the tax paid relevant to the J. H. Lock contract in the amount of $41,335.50 should be refunded. In the result, the appeal is allowed and the appellant is awarded its costs. J.

No. 07689 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA BETWEEN: Fairview Farms Limited and M.S.D. Enterprises Limited -and- A.A. Putnam Sons (l987) Limited nan Heard Before: The Honourable Justice Douglas L. MacLellan Place Heard: Truro, Nova Scotia Date(s) Heard: March 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1999 and April 9, 1999 Date of Written Decision: June 16, 1999 Counsel: Peter M. Rogers, Esq., for the plaintiffs William M. Leahey, Esq., for the defendant MACLELLAN, J. The dispute in this case is about how to interpret an agreement signed by three brothers in 1988 by which they reorganized their father’s farming operation. The brothers, Gene, Merle and Lorne Putnam, each formed new company at that time with Gene owning Fairview Farms Limited; Merle owning M.S.D. Enterprises Limited, and Lorne owning A.A. Putnam Sons (l987) Limited. The plaintiffs request rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by Lorne Putnam’s company. For easy reference, intend to refer to the brothers by name instead of by their respective company name. FACTS Prior to l987, the three brothers operated farming operation with their father under the company name of A.A. Putnam Sons Limited. That company was formed in l967. The operation consisted in 1987 of dairy farm with about 250 milking cows, beef operation, trailer park, and gravel pit operation. A.A. Putnam died in 1982, and after their father’s death, the three brothers continued to operate the company. They all worked in different aspects of the company. In 1987 they decided to reorganize the operation so that each brother would have his own business. There was general discussion among them about how this could be achieved, and finally an agreement was arrived at which provided that Lorne would retain the dairy operation; Merle would own and run the trailer park and gravel pit operation, and Gene would take the beef cattle and be set up on new farm in Debert called The Stiles Farm. The first document signed was on June 17th, 1987. It provided for the basic reorganization of the various activities. Each brother was to incorporate new company called “Geneco., Merleco., and Lorneco.”. The agreement provided by Article that there were number of conditions precedent to the new reorganization. It included the following: “Article 4.0l(d) Gene Co., Merle Co., and Lorne Co., reaching satisfactory agreement with respect to the purchase and sale of assets distributed on the reorganization subsequent thereto which agreement would also provide for the distribution of proceeds of the sale of milk quota within period of twenty years after the reorganization.” The evidence is that prior to the signing of this first agreement, Gene Putnam and his wife Ellen had originally wanted to continue to run the dairy operation because they had been doing that for the previous twenty years. However, after discussions with his brothers, Gene agreed that Lorne would take over the dairy operation. At the time of the reorganization of A.A. Putnam Sons Limited, the three brothers engaged an accountant Mr. James Cameron, of Collins Barrow, for advice on possible tax consequences arising from the reorganization. They also engaged Mr. Jim Stanley as the lawyer to do the legal work. There were number of meetings involving the brothers, Mr. Cameron and Mr. Stanley. Throughout these negotiations it was always understood that each brother would receive one-third share of all the assets owned at that time by A.A. Putnam Sons Limited. During the negotiations leading up to final agreement, which was not signed until March 1988, an appraiser Mr. Robert Adams was hired to do an appraisal of the assets of the parent company. His appraisal is before the court. (Exhibit Tab 29). It details the basis upon which he determined the value of the various assets of A.A. Putnam Sons Limited. The final reorganization agreement signed by the brothers provided by subsequent document called “Post Reorganization Agreement” that the Fluid Milk Quota owned by A.A. Putnam Sons Limited would be owned by Lorne Putnam’s company, now to be called A.A. Putnam Sons (1987) Limited, but if that quota was sold, or executed upon by creditor within fifteen years of 1987 the proceeds realized from the quota would be divided equally among the three brothers. This action results from the interpretation of that “Post Reorganization Agreement”, and in particular, Clause 3.00 which provides: (Exhibit Tab 8) “3.00 Sale of Quota by Putnam (87) 3.01 At any time prior to December 31, 2003 should Putnam (87) sell all or any part of its fluid milk quota, or should creditor of Putnam (87) realize on and sell the same, Putnam (87) agrees to pay the following: (a) To M.S.D., one third (l/3) of the gross proceeds received on the sale of the fluid milk quota. (b) To Fairview, one third (l/3) of the gross proceeds received on the sale of the fluid milk quota.” It is the position of the plaintiffs that this agreement should be interpreted to mean that if the defendant sold any of the milk quota which it held in November of 1987, prior to December 3lst, 2003, it was obligated to divide the proceeds three ways. The defendant alleges that the agreement only refers to Fluid Milk Quota, and therefore, it was obligated to only share proceeds from the sale of Fluid Milk Quota and not all quota sold. The court has heard lot of evidence on the subject of milk quotas. Generally, the evidence was to the effect that prior to 1987 farmer’s normal quota was made-up of Fluid Milk Quota (FMQ) and Market Share Quota, or MSQ. In 1987 A.A. Putnam Sons Limited had Fluid Milk Quota of 2,291 litres per day and Market Share Quota of 378,339 litres per year. In the years since 1987 the evidence establishes that these two quotas separated in that it became possible to sell only MSQ. In fact, an exchange for the sale of MSQ was set up by the Nova Scotia Dairy Commission in November of 1987 to do just that. In the years following 1988, the defendant sold MSQ and took the position that it was not obligated to share the proceeds with the plaintiffs. Ellen Putnam testified that she is the wife of Gene Putnam and that they looked after the dairy farm for A.A. Putnam Sons Limited during the period 1967 to 1987. She said that when the agreement was signed in 1988, she understood that the reference therein to Fluid Milk Quota meant both the Fluid Milk Quota owned by the company and the Market Share Quota. Her words were “you can’t have one without the other”. She indicated that the dairy operation started with only 35 milking cows and by 1987 had increased that to 250 with total herd of over 400 cattle. She testified that Gene’s father was sick for about three or four years prior to his death in l982 and that her husband Gene basically ran the dairy operation. She said she did the books for the farm from 1973 to 1987. She testified that in 1987 when the brothers started discussing reorganization, it was her idea that there be special arrangement concerning the milk quota. She said she did that because she felt that she and her husband had worked on the farm for about twenty years, and that therefore there should be twenty year period following the reorganization during which time all three brothers would share if the milk quota was sold. She said that her husband Gene was very much disappointed that he did not end up with the dairy operation, and that he reluctantly deferred to his brother Lorne. She said that she was aware that the term of twenty years was reduced to fifteen years prior to the signing of the final document. She said that she discussed the wording of this clause with Jim Cameron and during all of these discussions she intended that the clause would apply to all milk quotas and not just Fluid Milk Quota. Ellen Putnam indicated that she did not read the final agreement signed in March of 1988, but she and her husband received copy from Mr. Stanley after the signing. She testified that after she found out about some sales of quota by Scott Putnam, Lorne’s son, she made it clear that she and her husband were entitled to share the proceeds. She said that after one sale, she was approached numerous times by Lorne Putnam requesting that they give the money back to Scott so that he could buy the quota back. She said she disagreed and it was never explained to her why he sold quota if he then turned around and wanted to buy it back. Mrs. Putnam indicated that her brother Mr. John Ackerman is lawyer and worked with Mr. Stanley in his firm. She said that at one point she heard that Scott Putnam was leasing quota to other farmers and that she asked advice from her brother whether this was permitted. She said that in 1987 she had basic idea of what milk quota was worth, and therefore, was not surprised when Mr. Adams valued it at close to one million dollars. She said at that time she felt that MSQ was not worth whole lot and that you could not really buy or sell MSQ. She was not aware that milk quota exchange had been set up at that time. After 1987, she and her husband ran beef operation and were not concerned about milk quotas. On cross-examination Mrs. Putnam indicated that she was aware that there were two different types of quotas, but her understanding was that one went with the other. She said her husband never sold any quota during the time he ran the dairy operation. James Cameron is Chartered Accountant. He did the accounting work for A.A. Putnam Sons Limited. He was very involved in the negotiations leading up to the reorganization of that company. He testified that the clear intent of the three brothers was that the assets of the parent company were to be divided equally among them. He said it also was the intent of all the parties that the dairy operation continue as family farm in order to continue the tradition established by their parents. Mr. Cameron said he requested and got some tax advice from gentleman in his firm because all the parties were naturally concerned about possible tax consequences flowing from the reorganization of the parent company. He said at first they considered what is called “butterfly transaction”. This necessitated that each brother receive an exactly equal amount of assets from the parent company. That arrangement was discounted because it became evident that to do that the milk quota would have to be retained by the parent company. That was not possible under the Dairy Commission Rules because the quota had to be held by the actual milk producer who in this case was going to be Lorne Putnam’s company. Mr. Cameron said it was decided that the appropriate arrangement for tax purposes would be called freeze where each brother would incorporate separate company and the shares of that company would be held by the parent company of which the three brothers were equal shareholders. This arrangement was agreed to by all parties involved and the documentation for doing so was signed on March 11th, 1988. The agreements, however, indicated that the effective date of the new arrangement was in fact November 1st, 1987. Mr. Cameron said that it was clear to him that it was the intent that the milk quota would be transferred to Lorne Putnam’s company (A.A. Putnam Sons (l987) Limited), but that if the quota was disposed of prior to 2003 the proceeds from the quota sale would be shared equally among the three brothers. He said that agreement was to reflect the fact that the value of the quota was significantly higher if it was sold separately from the other farm assets or simply left with the farm operation as part of going concern. Mr. Cameron said that he was never asked to distinguish between Fluid Milk Quota and Market Share Quota. He understood they were one and the same. Gabriel Comeau testified. He became Manager of the Nova Scotia Dairy Commission in 1989. He explained how the Commission dealt with milk quota and the changes in the quota schemes during the years since 1989. He also was able to testify based on his knowledge of the Commission record about what had happened in 1987 to 1989. He explained that Fluid Milk Quota was normally used within the province, while Market Share Quota or Industrial Milk used in non-fluid products was traded between provinces, and therefore, there was involvement from the Canadian Diary Commission. It also had subsidy program for producers of MSQ. Mr. Comeau indicated that prior to 1987 the Nova Scotia Dairy Commission had an exchange program for the purchase and sale of MSQ. The price was pre-determined and the exchange normally operated towards the end of each year when it became significant to farmer whether he had met his quota obligations or not. In 1987 the Commission developed new exchange program based on supply and demand. It started in November of 1987, but was quickly met with court challenge. As result of the court decision in December of 1987, the Commission revised the program and the new exchange dealt only with MSQ and not Fluid Milk Quota. The new exchange permitted farmer to buy and sell MSQ as needed based on the going price at the time. Mr. Comeau also explained how in August 1990 MSQ was converted from litres per year into kilograms of butterfat per year and also how in August of 1994 Fluid Milk Quota and Market Share Quota were converted into Total Production Quota. Robert Adams was asked by Mr. James Cameron to prepare an appraisal of the assets of A.A. Putnam Sons Limited. His appraisal report (Exhibit Tab 29) sets out the value of the assets in two manners; namely, as going concern, and secondly, if the assets were sold off separately. Mr. Adams indicated that he worked as Director for the Nova Scotia Farm Loan Board until 1997. He was familiar with farm assets including milk quota and how the Board secured any loans advanced to farmers. He explained that in 1987 -88 the Board would obtain an assignment of farmer’s milk quota. This would protect it against the sale of such quota apart from the normal farm assets. He indicated that the form of the assignment used by the Nova Scotia Farm Loan Board at that time referred only to the Fluid Milk Quota because he said it was felt that that was the quota that had value. He said that around 1990 the wording of the assignment was changed and that both Fluid Milk Quota and Market Share Quota was to be assigned to the Board. He said this reflected the fact that in the late 1980's quota exchange was set up which permitted the sale of Market Share Quota separate from Fluid Milk Quota. Mr. Adams indicated that at the time he prepared his report he valued the Fluid Milk Quota, if it was sold as separate item, at $916,400.00. There was no valuation placed on the MSQ quota despite the fact that his report indicated that the farm had an MSQ of 47,000 litres per year. He indicated that the value of the farm on going concern basis was about $400,000.00 less than if the assets were sold piecemeal. James Stanley is lawyer and he drafted the agreements signed by the three Putnam brothers. He testified that he was asked by James Cameron to draft the agreements. He considered himself acting for all of the parties to the agreement, and in fact discussed with them the issue of possible conflict of interest. He obtained from each of them confirmation that they were aware of his role in preparing the legal documents. (Exhibit Tab 2). There is no suggestion here that Mr. Stanley was in conflict position. Mr. Stanley indicated that he understood his role to be simply to draft document reflecting the agreements arrived at among the parties. He did not negotiate the agreement for any of the parties. He indicated that the reorganization of A.A. Putnam Sons Limited came about because each of the brothers wanted to go their own way and that they were having difficulty working together. He also understood that there was agreement that all of them wanted the dairy operation to continue as family dairy operation and that Lorne and his son Scott would be doing that. The other major concern was to ensure that the method of reorganization attracted the least amount of taxes possible. Mr. Stanley indicated that he understood the quota issue arose because Gene and Ellen Putnam felt that since they had worked on the farm for about twenty years, basically running the operation, that they did not want the dairy operation sold off piecemeal because to do so would generate more revenue than was being assigned as value to the farm as going concern. He said that he understood from Mr. Cameron that the brothers had agreed that the special arrangement in regard to the sharing of quota revenue would continue for fifteen years. He said the fifteen year period was compromise because at first Gene and Ellen wanted twenty year period to reflect the same time they had worked on the dairy operation. Mr. Stanley was referred to the first reorganization agreement signed by the brothers on June l7th, 1987 (Exhibit Tab 7), which included by Article 4(a) number of conditions, precedents to the final agreement. In that document reference is made to “milk quota” while in the subsequent reorganization agreement signed by the parties in March 1988 the reference is to “Fluid Milk Quota” (Exhibit Tab Article 3). Mr. Stanley testified that as the drafter of the two documents he did not intend the change in words to mean anything. As far as he was concerned at the time he drafted the documents, the words “milk quota” and “Fluid Milk Quota” were interchangeable. He said that on behalf of the parties, he notified Scotsburn Dairy about the change in the quota ownership from A.A. Putnam Sons Limited to A.A. Putnam Sons (1987) Limited (Exhibit Tab and 2), and also the Nova Scotia Dairy Commission (Exhibit Tab and 4). He used the words “Fluid Milk Quota” and indicated it to be 2,29l litres per day without reference to the MSQ which he considered was also conveyed. He understood that by making reference to the Fluid Milk Quota he was automatically including the MSQ. That was because in his mind the MSQ had no value. On cross-examination Mr. Stanley said that he was not aware in March 1988 when the documents were signed that the Dairy Commission had set up an exchange for MSQ. He said that the documents he prepared were an attempt to reflect the agreement arrived at among the parties and that he was not involved in the forming of the terms of the agreement. He said that he was not aware at that time that MSQ could be sold. He said that when you transfer Fluid Milk Quota you got everything, including the MSQ. Claudia Putnam is the widow of Merle Putnam who died in 1996. She testified about her involvement and that of her husband in the reorganization of the family operation in l987-88. She said that her husband Merle did not get along with his brother Lorne and wanted to operate his business on his own. She said she and Merle discussed the reorganization of the company with Gene and Ellen. She said it was Ellen’s idea to put restriction on the sale of milk quota if it occurred within twenty years. The agreement would provide for each brother to get one-third of the funds realized from any such sale. She said that during these discussions and later discussions, involving Lorne, that there was no mention of MSQ, just milk quota. She said that she had not been involved in the dairy part of the operation. She said that after she and Merle heard that Lorne had sold quota, she said her husband wrote to the Dairy Commission indicating that he did not want his share of the funds realized. She said they talked about it at the time and had decided that if there were any future sales they would be claiming share. She said that after her husband’s death, she did write to the Farm Loan Board to confirm that on behalf of his Estate. She said that as result of that correspondence, she received $33,800.00 which represented one-third of sale made by Scott Putnam. She said that after getting that cheque she was approached number of time by Lorne Putnam requesting that she give the money back. She said he came to see her twenty or thirty times about that. She said she was upset by that and she felt he was harassing her. Claudia Putnam said that on March 11th, 1988, when the documents were signed, there was no discussion among the parties present about the quota issue and that neither she nor Merle read the documents before signing them. She said that later they were sent package of documents from Mr. Stanley which contained all the documents signed by the parties. She said she read the agreement and probably saw the clause about the Fluid Milk Quota but that it did not register as problem to her at that time. She testified that she and her husband first became aware of quota sales by Scott Putnam in 1995 and were not aware of any earlier sales. Gene Putnam testified. He indicated that there were number of meetings involving the three brothers along with James Cameron and Jim Stanley and John Ackerman, his wife’s brother. The first meetings were about how to divide up the assets of A.A. Putnam Sons Limited. He said that at the third meeting there was discussion about the quota issue. He said he understood that sharing would be of all the milk quota. He said he ran the dairy operation and was familiar with MSQ. He considered that to be industrial milk, and he did not know that MSQ could be sold separate from Fluid Milk Quota. He said during the twenty years he ran the dairy operation that he was always looking for new milk quota not wanting to sell quota. He did not know about the quota exchange set up around 1987. He said that when he discussed the length of the term of the quota agreement that his brother had said that it could be for l00 years because he (Lorne) did not care about how long it would run, because he had no intentions of selling quota. He said there was never any mention about the possible sale of MSQ by Lorne which would not trigger an obligation to share the proceeds. He said he first heard about quota sales by Scott Putnam in 1995. He said that when he heard about the quota sale, he contacted Lorne and was told that Scott was running the operation and that he (Lorne) would check with him about any quota sales. He said that Lorne later got back to him and confirmed there was in fact quota sale and that it was done because Scott needed the money to keep the farm going. He said Lorne did not want to pay out the two-third share as per the agreement. He said that after period of time, he finally got his share of the money. James Stonehouse is lawyer who acted for the Nova Scotia Farm Loan Board in 1987-88. He was called by the defendant and indicated that he was asked to prepare security documents for loan being advanced by the Farm Loan Board to Lorne and Scott Putnam as result of their take over of the operation of A.A. Putnam Sons Limited. Part of the security agreement was an assignment of the milk quota owned by the Putnams. He said he arranged for that assignment to be executed. (Exhibit Tab 11). He explained that the form of the assignment was prepared by the Farm Loan Board and at that time made reference only to milk quota. This was despite the fact that the letter of instructions from the Board to him said that the assignment should be of the Fluid Milk Quota. He said that later the form of these assignments was changed to include both Fluid Milk Quota and MSQ. He was shown an assignment (Exhibit 10) made in 1992 which referred to both quotas. Mr. Stonehouse said that in 1987 the word “milk quota” and Fluid Milk Quota were used interchangeably and as far as he was concerned producers felt that quota was quota. Scott Putnam is the son of Lorne Putnam. He took over the operation of the dairy farm after 1987 when A.A. Putnam Sons Limited was reorganized. He had worked on the farm since 1983 with Gene Putnam, his uncle, who was in charge of the dairy operation. Scott testified that he was at the Nova Scotia Agricultural College for three years. He did not complete the four year program and came home to work on the farm. He said he was familiar with milk quota from his training at the Agricultural College. He said that in the Spring of 1987 he took over as herdsman of the dairy farm after Gene left to set up his beef operation in Debert. He said he had conversation with his father about the MSQ and how it should not be involved in the sharing agreement because he wanted the flexibility to buy and sell MSQ depending on how the farm was doing in any particular year. He said he told his father that it would be impossible to run the farm operation if the MSQ could not be purchased and sold as needed. He said he was not involved in any of the discussions with his uncles about the agreements covering the division of assets. He said he is half owner of the new company A.A. Putnam Sons (1987) Limited with his father. He was present on March 11th, 1988 when the documents were signed. He said he did not read the documents signed on that day at that time or prior to the signing. He said he read the documents some time later when he received copy from Mr. Stanley’s office. He said that he understood the agreement to mean that he and his father had to share proceeds from the sale of only Fluid Milk Quota and had no obligation to share the proceeds from the sale of MSQ. He confirmed that in the years following 1987 he sold and purchased some MSQ. list of the transactions is produced at Exhibit 1, Tab 16, page 2. The sales were as follows: (1) March 1st, 1989 the sale of 48,677 litres for $35,923.38. (2) April 1st, 1989 the sale of 29,893 litres for $22,330.32. (2) March 1st, 1990 the sale of 80,000 litres for $43,200.00. (3) June 1st,1993 the sale of l,300 kilograms for $40,950.00. (4) December 1995 the sale of l2.5 kilograms of Total Production Quota (TPQ) for $l82,5l2.50 (5) July 1996 the sale of 0.9 kilograms of TPQ for $l3,500.00 (6) June 1997 the sale of 6.5 kilograms of TPQ for $l0l,400.00 (7) February 1998 the sale of 63.7 kilograms of TPQ for $l,042,l32.00. It is to be noted that in August 1994, the Nova Scotia Dairy Commission changed over to single quota system known as Total Production Quota (TPQ). Therefore, any sales after that date were under the new quota scheme. Scott Putnam testified that he did not tell his uncles about any of these sales because he did not believe it was any of their concern. He said that from 1988 to 1993 no Fluid Milk Quota was sold, only MSQ. In August 1994, TPQ came into existence. In December 1995 he sold as indicated 12.5 kilograms of TPQ and at that point was told by his father that Gene wanted his share from this sale which would amount to approximately $60,000.00. He said that at that time he owed the Nova Scotia Farm Loan Board about $500,000.00 and that they had an assignment on the milk quota, therefore, the cheque for the sale was made payable to them. He said at that point Merle Putnam agreed not to claim his share, therefore, he and his father received $l20,000.00 from that sale after Gene was paid. He said the sale that he made in July 1996 for which he received $l3,500.00 all went to the Farm Loan Board against his loan. In June 1997 he sold quota worth $l01,400.00 which was divided among the three parties. The last of the quota was sold on February 19th, 1998 for $l,042,000.00. That money is being held in trust subject to ruling on this case. On cross-examination Scott Putnam was asked if he indicated to his father prior to signing the agreements that he should discuss the quota issue with his brothers. He indicated that he did not. He also said that he told his father about the quota sales in 1989 to 1993 at the time they happened, or at least within month of the sale. He said he sold MSQ because he felt they were not making money on the sale of that milk, therefore, were better off without that quota. He was asked why he did not notify his uncles after the 1995 sale when he sold TPQ. He said he figured they would find out themselves. Lorne Putnam testified. He said that in 1987 when the brothers first discussed reorganizing the parent company that Gene was running the dairy operation. He said he wanted to take over that operation because of his son Scott who was working on the dairy farm with Gene. He said Gene agreed to take the beef operation and that he would be set up on the Stiles property which they intended to purchase as part of the package. He said the brothers sat down with James Cameron and Jim Stanley and discussed during number of meetings how the matter would be handled. He said he signed the first document in June 1997. (Exhibit 2, Tab 7). He said he had discussions with Scott about quota prior to signing the agreement and that Scott wanted to have the right to sell MSQ. He said the arrangement was that Scott would be running the operation of the dairy farm. He said that as result of the meeting held with his brothers and Mr. Cameron and Mr. Stanley that only the Fluid Milk Quota would be shared. He said he discussed with his wife the length of the time that the sharing agreement would be in place. She favoured ten year term instead of twenty. He said they later agreed on fifteen years as compromise. He said he felt the number of years did not mean anything, because he had no intention of selling quota, therefore, he had made the comment to Gene that the term could be for 100 years as far as he was concerned. He said that when Gene approached him about the sale of the quota he was not aware of it. He said he discussed it with Scott and explained to Gene why it was done. He said it was because Scott needed capital to finance manure project he was involved in at the time. He said he was surprised that Scott had sold quota and that the sales actually upset him. He said that quota was important to farm operation because it is the basis upon which the farm generates revenue. ISSUE The plaintiffs claim that the court should rectify the signed agreements here to match the intention of the parties. It would involve changing the words used in the final agreement from Fluid Milk Quota to simply milk quota and would mean that all sales of quota would have to be shared. The defendant takes the position that the agreement reflected the intention of the parties at the time of signing and that there should be no rectification because it was not justified in the circumstances. They say that the MSQ sales were allowed under the agreement and that the defendant has no responsibility to share the proceeds realized from the sales of MSQ. They also ask that in light of the changes in quota description since 1988, the court determine how much of the quota sales made after 1994 consisted of Fluid Milk Quota, and therefore, what percentage needs to be shared. It is suggested that the TPQ quota sales should be assessed as having MSQ component of 62 percent and that therefore only 38 percent needs to be shared. THE LAW RECTIFICATION OF CONTRACT There is general agreement between counsel that rectification of contract is possible given certain circumstances. Fridman’s, Law of Contract in Canada, Third Edition, describes it as follows: (p. 82l-822) “The essence of rectification is to bring the document which was expressed or intended to be in pursuance of prior agreement into harmony with that prior agreement. It deals with the situation where, contracting parties having reduced into writing the agreement reached by their negotiations, some mistake was made in the wording of the final, written contract, altering the effect, in whole or in part, of the contract. What the court does is to alter the document, in accordance with the evidence, and then enforce the document as changed. Rectification is not used to vary the intentions of the parties, but to correct the situation where the parties have settled upon certain terms but have written them down incorrectly. But the court will not give remedy for party who is displeased with what the contract has brought him.” Rectification is remedy which is only to be used if the court is satisfied based on convincing evidence that it is appropriate to do so. (See Federal Business Development Bank v. Elcon Petroleum Maintenance Limited (1983), 58 N.S.R. (2d) 246). FINDINGS find that in this case that am convinced that when Gene, Merle and Lorne Putnam sat down in 1987 to discuss how they would divide up the family operation they intended the following. (1) That each of them would end up essentially with the same value in assets. (2) That the dairy farm would continue to operate as it had for many years as family operation and that therefore it would be valued on the basis of going concern instead of simply the total of its individual parts. (3) That in light of the agreement to value the farm as going concern, it was agreed that there would be an arrangement to protect against the sale of the milk quota prior to the year 2003. (4) That at the time the brothers were not aware that Market Share Quota could be sold separate from Fluid Milk Quota and when they discussed milk quota they meant the entire milk quota. The evidence here is that in 1987 Gene and Ellen Putnam basically had run the dairy operation since 1967 while Merle and Lorne looked after other company activities. It is clear to me that when there was talk of each brother going his separate way, Gene Putnam expected that he would be left with the dairy operation, however, when confronted with request from his older brother Lorne that he be granted the dairy operation as his share of the assets, Gene agreed for the sake of family harmony. The first agreement (Exhibit Tab 7) had as condition precedent that any agreement about distribution of assets would contain an agreement that if the milk quota was sold each of the brothers would receive one-third share. find at that time; namely, June 1987 all the parties understood milk quota to be one entity, that is, Fluid Milk Quota and that Market Share Quota or Industrial Milk was simply an extension of the Fluid Milk Quota. The people most involved in the dairy operation were Gene Putnam and Ellen Putnam. believe them when they testified that they assumed that “you can’t have one without the other”. believe that Lorne Putnam who really was not much involved in the dairy operation did know that there were different quotas, but did not understand how each related to the other. Scott Putnam testified that prior to his father signing the final agreement in 1988 he discussed with his father the issue of milk quota, and specifically MSQ, and the importance of it not being covered by the sharing agreement. reject Scott Putnam’s evidence on that point. do so because of the following: (1) do not believe that Scott Putnam knew at that point that MSQ could be sold separately from Fluid Milk Quota. (2) believe that if Scott discussed this with his father, Lorne would have brought it up with his brothers and James Cameron. All of them, including Lorne, agreed it was never discussed in that context. (3) There is no evidence before me that would make Scott Putnam believe that the final documents would refer to Fluid Milk Quota not simply milk quota. The document signed in June l987 referred only to milk quota. The question is why would Scott think that the final document would have different wording unless change was discussed. (4) When Scott Putnam testified about the sales of MSQ during 1989 to 1990, he said that he told his father about these sales within month of each sale. His father testified that he was not told and did not know about the sales until he was questioned by Gene in 1995 and then asked Scott for particulars. believe Lorne’s evidence on that point over that of his son Scott about whether he was told about the sales. (5) believe Scott wanted to hide the sales of quota from his uncles because he knew that if they became aware of sales, he would be forced to share the proceeds. Lorne Putnam testified that he discussed quotas with Scott prior to the signing of the final documents in March 1988. His evidence is that Scott wanted to have the right to sell MSQ. reject that evidence of Lorne Putnam. do not believe him when he testified that he discussed the issue with Scott. do so because believe if there was such discussion, he would, naturally, have discussed the issue with James Cameron and his brothers and this was not done. At that point there would appear to be no reason why such discussion would not take place if it was reasonable and fair to exclude MSQ from the sharing agreement. There appears to be no reason why that could not have been negotiated. believe that Lorne Putnam never discussed it with his brothers and Mr. Cameron because there was no such discussion with his son about the importance of having that flexibility. believe that in 1987 Lorne Putnam was not aware that MSQ could be sold separate from Fluid Milk Quota. Finally, in light of the fact that Lorne Putnam signed an agreement in June l987 in which reference was made to simply milk quota there was no reason for him to expect that the wording would change prior to March of 1988 since he did not bring up with Mr. Stanley the issue of the particular wording of the clause. He also did not even read the documents to determine what the wording was in March 1988. The only reasonable conclusion would be that based on the 1987 documents, he expected the 1988 documents to contain the words milk quota, not Fluid Milk Quota. conclude in this case that all the requirements necessary to allow rectification have been proven. I find that all the parties to the agreement signed in March 1988 intended that the milk quota owned by A.A. Putnam & Sons Limited would be shared by all three if sold within fifteen years of that date. believe that the document signed by the parties in June of 1988 did not reflect this intention when it referred to only Fluid Milk Quota. I would therefore rectify that agreement to read milk quota, which I find includes Fluid Milk Quota and Market Share Quota. Based on that rectification I find that the plaintiffs are entitled to their respective shares of all the sales of quota made after March 1988. This, of course, is subject to the fact that Merle Putnam agreed to forego his share of the sale made in December of 1995. Based on Exhibit Tab 22, it would appear that the amount claimed by each plaintiff is the sum of $399,345.23. However, this does not account for the fact that on May 1st, 1990, Scott Putnam purchased 7,500 litres of MSQ for $5,250.00. He has no obligation to share quota purchased after 1988, therefore, each plaintiff will be entitled to judgment in the amount of $397,595.23. understand counsel will work out the issue of pre-judgment interest between themselves and would award costs to the plaintiffs. would indicate that if had not found that the agreement should be rectified, would have found that when the Fluid Milk Quota and the Market Share Quota were combined to form Total Production Quota in August 1994, that Fluid Milk Quota made up 84.2 percent of the new quota formula. Therefore, the plaintiffs would have been entitled to 84.2 percent of any sales made by the defendant of Total Production Quota. reject the suggestion by counsel for the defendant that the percentage should be as low as 35 percent because of combining of quota figures in number of provinces. This issue is of no consequences in light of my decision in regard to rectification of the contract itself.",e_1999canlii6888.txt,"The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales.
The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales.
The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales.
Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification,
that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales.
The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties."

1989, c. 160 as amended, requiring the appellant father, Gilbert Roland Hill to pay maintenance for his son James Anthony Davis.
The respondent, Pamela Davis, is James’ mother.
BACKGROUND[2] Roland Hill and Pamela Davis, had a brief relationship in 1981 when Ms. Davis was 16 years old.
Their child, James Davis, was born on June 2nd, 1982.
[3] Ms. Davis says she told Mr. Hill of James birth early on.
Mr. Hill maintains he was unaware of Ms. Davis’ pregnancy until 1996, when Ms. Davis brought an application for child maintenance for James under the Family Maintenance Act (now the Maintenance and Custody Act).
He was ordered to pay maintenance of $500 monthly, commencing June 5th, 1996.
James had some contact with his father after that time but continued to reside with his mother.
[4] In June 2000 James completed grade 12 at Millwood High School.
[5] In early 2001 Mr. Hill filed an application to terminate the support for James.
Mr. Hill either did not know or did not believe James had re-enrolled in school in January.
By that time, James was living with his father, having moved in with him on April 4.
[6] James abandoned his upgrading attempt and sought employment.","The defendant contracted with the plaintiff for supply and installation of materials.
The defendant was not satisfied with the plaintiff's work, hired a third party to fix the plaintiff's work and refused to pay the plaintiff.
The plaintiff sued for payment of the outstanding account
HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed.
The Court found enough evidence to conclude that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that there was a breach of the implied condition that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard.
As the plaintiff's workmanship constitutes a breach of contract, the defendant's damages are set off against the claim.","[2, 5, 8, 4, 11, 6, 14, 12, 15, 19, 10, 7, 17, 9]",626,"nan QUEEN’S BENCH FOR SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2010 SKQB 464 Date: 2010 12 17 Docket: Q.B.G. No. 1553 of 2008 Judicial Centre: Regina BETWEEN: GEORGE ROBERT LAWSON and VINCENT THOMAS McKAY Appearing: William J. Herle for the plaintiff Vincent Thomas McKay appearing on his own behalf JUDGMENT WILSON J. December 17, 2010 [1] The defendant, Vincent McKay, contracted with the plaintiff, George Lawson, for the supply and installation of eavestroughing, soffit and facia together with two downspouts, capping of three garage doors and capping of wooden trim, all to be installed on a new garage building located on Mr. McKay’s land. [2] Mr. Lawson completed work on Mr. McKay’s garage and presented written invoice to Mr. McKay in the sum of $2,800.00. Mr. McKay has not paid Mr. Lawson’s account. Mr. McKay was dissatisfied with the work of Mr. Lawson. Mr. McKay hired others to repair the work. He takes the position that Mr. Lawson’s claim should be dismissed. [3] On October 14th, 2008, Mr. Lawson caused to be registered at the Land Titles Registry, Province of Saskatchewan claim of lien under The Builders’ Lien Act, S.S. 1984-85-86, c. B-7.1, as am. Mr. Lawson then issued a statement of claim in this Court seeking judgment against Mr. McKay in the sum of $2,800.00 and an order that Mr. Lawson is entitled to a lien under the provisions of The Builders’ Lien Act. [4] In July of 2009, Mr. Lawson brought motion seeking leave to enter final judgment against Mr. McKay, in the sum of $2,800.00, with interest to date of judgment, and judgment entitling Mr. Lawson to maintain his lien under the provisions of The Builders’ Lien Act. On August 6th, 2009, Zarzeczny J. made an order that this action be set down for summary trial with no examinations for discovery or pre-trial conference. Zarzeczny J. ordered that the procedure at this summary trial would be the procedure for simplified trial as set out in Saskatchewan, Court of Queen’s Bench Rules, rule 494. It was further ordered that the affidavits that were filed in the proceeding would be the evidence-in-chief of the witnesses and that the witnesses were to be made available for cross-examination at trial. [5] The following affidavits are evidence in the matter before me: 1. The affidavit of George Robert Lawson sworn June 22nd, 2009; 2. The supplementary affidavit of George Robert Lawson sworn July 24th, 2009; 3. The affidavit of Vincent T. McKay sworn July 9th, 2009; 4. The supplementary affidavit of Vincent T. McKay sworn July 30th, 2009; 5. The affidavit of William Borbely, filed on behalf of the defendant, Mr. McKay, sworn July 9th, 2009; and 6. The affidavit of Keenan Young, filed on behalf of the defendant, Mr. McKay, sworn July 10th, 2009. [6] At the trial of this matter both Mr. Lawson and Mr. McKay testified. In addition, Mr. Young and Mr. Borbely testified. THE EVIDENCE [7] In August, 2008, Mr. McKay constructed cottage roof garage on his property located at Boggy Creek, Saskatchewan. After completing the concrete, framing, brick work and roofing, Mr. McKay began search for contractors to supply and install eavestroughing, soffit and facia, as well as other items, on his new garage building. Mr. McKay phoned several contractors who were unable to do the job immediately. He then contacted Mr. Lawson who advertised in the phone book as Midwest Eavestroughing operating out of Lumsden, Saskatchewan. [8] Mr. Lawson and Mr. McKay met at Mr. McKay’s home on September 3rd, 2008. After reviewing the garage, Mr. Lawson provided Mr. McKay with quotation for the supply and installation of eavestroughing, soffit, and facia materials on the garage. More specifically, Mr. Lawson agreed to supply and install approximately 140 linear feet of eavestroughing, soffit and facia together with two downspouts, capping of three garage doors and capping of wooden trim, for the total price of $2,800.00 including goods and services tax. Mr. McKay acknowledges that he agreed to contract price of $2,800.00. However, he says he wanted written contract confirming particulars and price which he never received from Mr. Lawson. Mr. Lawson says that Mr. McKay never requested written contract after accepting the verbal quotation in the sum of $2,800.00. He said it was not his practice to prepare written contracts on jobs of the size in issue and that he would simply present an invoice after the work was completed. [9] Mr. Lawson worked on Mr. McKay’s garage for three days in early September, 2008. On September 6th, 2008, Mr. Lawson provided Mr. McKay with his invoice in the sum of $2,800.00. [10] Mr. McKay had significant concerns with respect to the work done by Mr. Lawson. Mr. McKay alleged the soffitting was not installed correctly on the west wall causing installation of the siding to be bowed on the last row. In addition, he says the corner areas were not cut into 45° angle. As regards the facia, Mr. McKay says that the facia installed on the west and east walls was rippled and overlapped in the wrong direction. As regards the capping on the three garage doors, Mr. McKay says that the capping was not placed flush before screws were used. In addition he complained that silver screws were used on the capping which showed up badly against the white capping. [11] Capping was also required on four small pieces of wood. Mr. McKay says the capping ordered and supplied by Mr. Lawson did not fit as it was not wide enough. It is not disputed that Mr. Lawson installed two of the four caps his first day on the job, but that on the second day of the job Mr. McKay had his electrician, Mr. Borbely, remove the caps that did not fit and arranged for four new caps to be made. Mr. Borbely installed the four new cappings after removing the two installed by Mr. Lawson. [12] With respect to the vertical siding installation above the garage doors, Mr. McKay says that no drip cap was installed, no caulking was done, pieces of building paper were missing and the siding was stapled across in visible lines with dark staples. Finally, as regards the eavestroughing and two downspouts, the eavestroughing, according to Mr. McKay, had roller marks throughout and no downspouts were ever installed. [13] By letter dated September 18th, 2008, Mr. McKay detailed his concerns regarding Mr. Lawson’s work. After receiving the letter Mr. Lawson attended at Mr. McKay’s property, on September 23rd, 2008. Mr. Lawson says he observed some very minor correction work and offered to do repairs. In addition, Mr. Lawson said he was prepared to install the two downspouts which he had not completed. It is not disputed that Mr. McKay did not agree to Mr. Lawson making any repairs. [14] Mr. McKay contacted Mr. Young and Mr. Borbely to review the work done by Mr. Lawson. The decision was made to remove the soffit, facia and eavestroughing installed by Mr. Lawson. Mr. Keenan replaced all the work in mid October, 2008 and provided bill to Mr. McKay in the sum of $1,785.00 taxes included. Mr. McKay prepared full cost list which includes additional costs for work done by Mr. Borbely in the sum of $426.60 and supplies from Home Depot and Wayne Building Products in the sum of $158.82. Finally, the cost list includes $350.00 which Mr. McKay says would cover work Mr. McKay performed and his cost to pick up supplies. In total, Mr. McKay says the amount required to fix the installation work of Mr. Lawson, was the sum of $2,720.42. ANALYSIS [15] The issue before me is whether Mr. McKay is liable to pay Mr. Lawson’s outstanding account. Mr. McKay’s concerns are with respect to the installation of the soffit, facia and eavestroughing and no evidence was led to indicate the products used in the installation were defective. Mr. McKay has not specifically argued breach of contract regarding the installation. However, his position that he is not liable to pay Mr. Lawson’s account must be based on breach of contract. [16] find as fact that Mr. Lawson and Mr. McKay entered into an oral contract for the supply and installation of soffit, facia and eavestroughing. There is clear evidence in the affidavit filed by Mr. McKay that after Mr. Lawson provided quote for his services in the sum of $2,800.00, taxes included, Mr. McKay agreed to the contract price. Mr. McKay’s evidence regarding his desire to have the terms of the oral contract set out in writing is, even if true, irrelevant. [17] There is an implied term in the contract for the performance of services that the work will be carried out in “proper and workmanlike manner”. This legal principle is summarized by Dawson J. in Maisonneuve v. Burley 2001 SKQB 407 (CanLII), [2002] W.W.R. 111 (Sask. Q.B.), where she states as follows in paras. 26 The contract between the plaintiffs and the defendant was contract to do work and supply materials. The governing law is set forth in Mack v. Stuike (1963), 1963 CanLII 332 (SK QB), 43 D.L.R. (2d) 763 (Sask. Q.B.). At p. 771 of Mack, supra, Balfour J. quotes from Halsbury’s Law of England, vol. 3, 3d ed. (London: Butterworths, 1953) at 435, para. 818 as follows: ... contract to perform any work, in the absence of any stipulation as to the manner in which it is to be carried out, implies condition that the work shall be done in good and workmanlike manner, and the workmen employed on the work must be possessed of the ordinary amount of skill possessed by those exercising the particular trade. ... 27 As stated in Goldsmith on Canadian Building Contracts (looseleaf; (Rel. 2) 1998) (Toronto: Carswell, 1988) at pp. 5-11 through 5-12: Work which does not meet the requirements of the specifications contained in the contract, or which, in the absence of such specifications, is not of reasonable workmanlike quality, is not proper compliance with the contract and constitutes breach. Furthermore, compliance by the contractor with the specifications will not be sufficient performance if the specifications were prepared by him and are deficient, even if they were approved by the owner. Whether work, or material supplied, is defective or not is, in each case, question of fact, depending on the construction of the particular specifications where there are any, and on expert evidence as to what is reasonable where there are none. Where contract, either expressly or by implication, contains particular standard for the work to be done, an owner is not entitled to insist on work of higher quality. For example, an owner who contracts for the construction of bush road is not entitled to insist on standard of construction applicable to provincial highway. [18] In the matter before me there is no evidence that Mr. McKay instructed Mr. Lawson to perform the installation services in particular manner. Thus, in the absence of any specifications, must determine whether the services rendered by Mr. Lawson were done in good and workmanlike manner. The test for compliance with the workmanlike standard is fitness for purpose (see: Vogel (Al) Construction Ltd. v. Forbes, (1998), 1998 CanLII 13367 (SK QB), 174 Sask. R. 236, [1998] S.J. No. 696). The purpose for the contract in the matter before me was to install eavestroughing to provide adequate drainage of water off the roof of the garage and keep water from entering the walls of the garage. [19] Mr. Lawson testified at trial that the work he did for Mr. McKay was done to industry standards. Mr. Lawson takes the position that many of Mr. McKay’s complaints were regarding minor aesthetic issues, as opposed to any significant problem with Mr. Lawson’s work. For example, the use of silver screws as opposed to white and the facia overlapping so as to be unsightly to pedestrians approaching the garage. Mr. Lawson says he would have done minor repairs, finished the job by installing the downspouts, and replaced section of trough that had rippling, but that he was not allowed by Mr. McKay to remedy the problems. [20] Mr. McKay takes the position that the work was so “shoddy” that the entire job had to be redone. Mr. McKay called two witnesses to support his position. [21] Mr. Borbely is an electrician who Mr. McKay hired to install perimeter lights on the garage. In his affidavit filed in this matter Mr. Borbely said that he noticed the capping over the pseudo-like pilasters installed by Mr. Lawson did not fit well. Mr. Borbely said he wanted the surface to be flat in order to prevent water from getting into perimeter lights that would be mounted on the pilasters. Under cross-examination at trial he acknowledged that it was not “his call” to say whether or not the capping had to be redone. Mr. McKay asked him to replace the capping. In addition to the capping, Mr. Borbely says that he noticed the eavestroughing had ripples and that mitred corners had not been installed. Mr. Borbely was of the view that because some of the soffitting material had been installed askew it would be very difficult to retrofit mitred corners. [22] Mr. Young also testified for Mr. McKay. Mr. Young is involved in the exterior construction business, both as worker and an owner. Mr. Young was known to Mr. McKay as Mr. Young had in the past worked for Everflow Eaves and Exteriors Inc. Mr. Young was called by Mr. McKay to attend at the site and review the work done by Mr. Lawson. [23] Mr. Young says he noticed unsightly roller marks. He further noticed that the facia on the east and west sides were not overlapped south to north creating unsightly overlaps. He saw that the soffitting on the west side was bowed and would have to be removed and lowered in order to level the siding and soffit. Upon inspecting the corners, Mr. Young says the corners were leaking and rust appeared on the northwest and southwest corners. He observed silicone like caulking floating in the eavestroughs. Finally, he noticed that the soffitting on the corners was not coming in square. It appeared that the soffitting was not locked in and ran at an angle in several places. According to Mr. Young this would cause the corner soffitting to be off square and the soffitting would eventually fall down. During his testimony at trial Mr. Young testified about the installation of the facia. He indicated it was industry standard to overlap the facia in such way that pedestrian traffic would not notice the overlap. It was Mr. Young’s view that the work could not be repaired, particularly the roller marks/dents. [24] Having reviewed all of the evidence, find that number of complaints made by Mr. McKay relating to the work performed by Mr. Lawson relate to aesthetics. However, there is enough evidence of significant problems for me to conclude that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that, therefore, there has been a breach of the implied condition of the contract that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard. Specifically, Mr. Lawson’s failure to install drip capping, mitred corners, properly caulk, and lock in the soffitting, appear to be critical for proper drainage of water away from the garage. For that reason conclude that Mr. Lawson did breach the oral contract as the quality of installation was of such standard as to amount to poor workmanship. [25] Having found breach of contract, Mr. McKay is entitled to damages. In Maisonneuve, supra, Dawson J. states at para. 41 Whether one considers damages for breach of contract or damages in tort, the damages will usually be the reasonable costs of remedying the defects. However, an owner is entitled only to have such defects remedied to such extent as to conform to the requirement of the contract, but not to require additional work or work of higher quality. [26] In this matter the cost of repair, as set out on the cost list prepared by Mr. McKay, is slightly less than the cost quoted by Mr. Lawson for the job. Mr. McKay cannot be said to have decided to proceed with additional work or to have work done of higher quality than the work expected to be performed by Mr. Lawson. am, therefore, setting off the damages as against Mr. Lawson’s claim. CONCLUSION [27] As set out above, I have concluded that Mr. Lawson’s workmanship constitutes a breach of contract, and Mr. McKay’s damages are set off against the claim. Mr. Lawson’s claim is therefore dismissed. [28] There shall be no costs in this matter. J. D. L. Wilson",e_2010skqb464.txt,"The defendant contracted with the plaintiff for supply and installation of materials.
The defendant was not satisfied with the plaintiff's work, hired a third party to fix the plaintiff's work and refused to pay the plaintiff.
The plaintiff sued for payment of the outstanding account
HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed.
The Court found enough evidence to conclude that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that there was a breach of the implied condition that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard.
As the plaintiff's workmanship constitutes a breach of contract, the defendant's damages are set off against the claim."
