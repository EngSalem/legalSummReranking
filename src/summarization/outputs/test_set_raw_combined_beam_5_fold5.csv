He used his position of authority as police chief to commit the crimes. The offender did not have a criminal record. The offences were premeditated, and directed against trusting and well-intentioned organizations. Sentencing the offender to four months consecutive imprisonment on each count, for a total of twenty months, and ordering restitution to the victims,  that the sentence must serve as a message of deterrence to all individuals who hold positions of trust and authority. This message is particularly important to police officers, whose integrity must be beyond reproach.","The defendant plead guilty to five theft related charges. The total amount of money involved was $64,000. He was 43 years old and a former Chief of Police for the Town of Kentville. He had been a police officer since 1975. Aggravating factors included his age, lack of criminal record, and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and to the community."
b_2014skqb81.txt,"Limitation of Actions – Mortgage – Saskatchewan Farmland SecurityHELD: When s. 12 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act was enacted it was the legislature’s intention that a mortgagee, to whom The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act applied, could suspend the limitation period clock from running and after serving a notice of intention to enforce its security, provided that within three years of such service the mortgagee made application to the court for an order under s. 11 permitting it to commence an enforcement action. If the three years for making such an application expires without an application being made, the limitation period begins to run again. The notice of extension in this case expired in 2009 and the limitation clock began to run again. The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce the respondent’s mortgage has expired and the registration of the mortgage is ordered discharged.",HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the registration of mortgage against land be discharged on the basis that the limitation period to enforce the mortgage has expired. The respondent’s mortgage was registered at the Land Titles Office. This registration continues to date as Interest Registration No. 106597705. The reason the respondent served notice of intention to foreclose upon the applicant was that s. 12 of the Farm Security Act had suspended the running of the limitation time. The applicant had obtained a perpetual right to commence enforcement proceedings without regard to any limitation periods.  The court found that the wording of s. 22 of the Act could not be interpreted to mean that a three-year limitation period had expired because the purpose of the legislation was to prevent mortgagees from foreclosing on farmers who have a reasonable possibility of meeting their obligations under their mortgages and if they are making sincere and reasonable effort to meet those obligations. The amendment to s. 11(1) did not include an order requiring the mortgagee to complete a financial report within 150 days of service of the application.

Part of the order sought provided for the payment of solicitor fees by way of a contingency fee agreement negotiated with the applicant. The contingency fee agreement was never filed with the prothonotary. Granting the order relating to the settlement amount, but setting aside the contingency fee agreement, that Civil Procedure Rule 63.19(1) requires that all contingency fee agreements be filed with the prothonotary. As this was not done, the applicant's solicitor is only entitled to compensation as would have been payable in the absence of the contingency agreement.",The applicant sought approval of the court for a settlement of a crush injury to the right leg below the knee. The medical reports on file indicated that the infant had suffered a small crush injury but no surgery was required and the infant was advised to return to his pre-accident activities. The Contingency Fee Agreement between the applicant's law practice and the public school district did not appear to have been filed within the required ten days or at all. Counsel were instructed to present to the court an appropriate bond in this matter. This bond was approved.
9_2014skqb386.txt,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction. Corrigendum received dated March 6, 2015 and added to fulltext. HELD: The appeal was granted.  1) Given the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) that the person who occupies the driver's seat is deemed to have care or control, the trial judge considered whether the appellant had rebutted the presumption so as to rebut the presumption of accuracy, he had no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, stayed the proceedings.  2) Given that the presumption is rebutting, the appellant was found to have been in actual care of control. The trial judge in this case adopted the reasoning of Green P.C.J. at the second trial and adopted his own reasoning. He found that, just barely, in the opinion of the appellant, he was definitely in actual control of his vehicle at the time of the offence. He also found that the RCMP did not err in not asking the appellant what he had been drinking that day and whether he had consumed beer within fifteen minutes of taking the roadside test. The Crown did not take issue with the appellant's assertion that his consumption of beer was the two beers at the scene and that he was simply mistaken for to the amount of alcohol he consumed that day or was deliberately misleading the Court in an attempt to defeat this charge. 3) The evidence of the roadside instrument and the Intoxilizer readings simply could not have been obtained by the consumption of one or two beers while stopped at the roadside in the manner the accused described. Prosecutorial misconduct and improper motivation are but two of many factors to be taken into account when a Crown seeks to re-lay the indictment. The appellant has not established an abuse of process. The facts of the case are unremarkable. It's not one of those clearest of cases where the court should direct a judicial stay."
d_2001nsca44.txt,"The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death, causing death in the operation of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and causing bodily harm while under the influence of alcohol. The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury. Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial. Finally, there were no errors by the judge on any of the other grounds advanced for appeal.","Following a trial in the Supreme Court, before Justice Simon MacDonald and a jury, the appellant was convicted of four offences arising out of her operation of a motor vehicle. The appellant appealed her conviction, and raised numerous grounds of appeal. In none of these grounds did the appellant take the position that the jury's verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence."
5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.",HELD: The appeals were dismissed. The court found that the respondent had no standing to bring his application pursuant to s. 222(d) of the Act and that the Chambers judge made errors in his approach to the application.
c_2005skqb166.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused. As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and, secondly, with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). The trial judge concluded that the impaired driving charge was stronger than the.08 charge and, in his opinion, a conviction only for impaired driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. In this case, the trial judge made no errors in law. The decision of the Provincial Court Judge was not used to avoid a multiple conviction issue. Volume of consumption falls within the provisions of s. 253(b). The reason for doing so is the use of judicial stay to prevent vexatiousness and additional punishment that would otherwise result. With respect to that conviction, the appellant seeks to have it set aside and either an acquittal entered or a new trial ordered by virtue of alleged reliance on the readings contained in Certificate of Analysis; and (b) consideration of evidence arising subsequent to the breath demand. The evidence as to the accused's driving behaviour was attributable to his hurt ankle and was not as result of any impairment from the considerable alcohol that he had, he had drank. The only foundation for the conclusion of impairment articulated in his rather rambling reasons for judgment are references to beer consumption some hours earlier and 'he is more than twice the legal limit.' The Court was to determine whether a conviction should be entered on that charge."
4_1996canlii6841.txt,"The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax. Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications. The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately. The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.","Husky Oil appealed a decision of the Revenue and Financial Services Board which upheld the assessment of sales tax. The respondent, under the provisions of the Education and Health Tax Act and the Department of Revenue and Finance Act, conducted an audit resulting in the assessment in the amount of $37,842.07. The appellant argued the board erred in its conclusion that the purchase of the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use in Saskatchewan and there was evidence before the Board upon which it was open to them to come to that conclusion. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision reversed. Husky Oil was awarded its costs of the appeal. 1)The Board's interpretation of the word 'published' asused in s.5(1)(b) of the Act was not a question of law reviewable by this Court. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly. 2)Every province with a sales tax exempts books. Most of the wording is very similar to Saskatchewan's exemption except that Saskatchewan's applies only to books which meet the definition of 'publication'. Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, in their respective sales tax reports, introduced the restriction on books with the words 'that are solely for educational, technical, cultural or literary purposes'. 3)Every person residing or carrying on business in Saskatchewan who brings into the province or who receives delivery in the province of tangible personal property for his own consumption or use, or for the consumption of other persons at his expense, or on behalf of or as agent for principal who desires to acquire the property for their own purposes, the question is likely, but not always one of law, to be determined by the Board. 4)On an appeal the facts are deemed to have been conclusively established by the findings of the board unless made on evidence which does not warrant that finding. 5)The Court's role is supervisory in nature. Questions of law are within the purview of the Court. On a questions of fact the Court has to determine whether an item is published book or technical paper, he must determine whether the production, distribution or availability is sufficiently public or broadly available so as to constitute published versus an unpublished technical paper. The alternative does not focus on the extent to which a purchase is made but rather the purpose for which the purchase was made for. The latter is more consistent with the purposes set out in the Act than with an objective objective such as determining whether technical papers are produced, distributed or available to a sufficiently broad audience."
2011skca19.txt,"The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge quashed the conviction and ordered a new trial. The Crown appealed the conviction of the officer who assaulted the complainant. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court found that the officer was mistaken in his belief that he was in imminent danger of death and that his action was necessary in self-defence to be reasonable. The officer did not direct himself to all of the relevant evidence, which resulted in a reviewable error. The judge focused on the fact there were two officers present. He did not address the complainant's statement that the finger incident occurred twice, which formed the basis for him to find that the instruction to leave the yard also occurred twice. In the context of the argument, the officer's position was that he viewed the complainant as a threat and that he attempted to talk him down. The accused did not wave his finger at the officer and the officer remained on the ground."
e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","This is an appeal by the City of Regina and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision dated October 10, 2003, of Roger J. F. LePage, sitting as a Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Court found that the tribunal erred in law in finding that the City was not prejudiced by the considerable time that has elapsed since the complaint took place. The tribunal also failed to take into account the fact that the applicant had Cerebral Palsy. 2) The court found that CUPE had met their duty to accommodate because of the applicant's disability. 3) The applicant was found to have received 4% less in wages than other comparable City employees because of his disability. The wage differential was inappropriate and compensated the applicant in the amount of $8,902.00. The applicant did not have a disability. He was employed as a truck driver for 16 years. His job was to haul materials with an eight-ton tandem truck. It was assumed that the next available position would be permanent. Permanent employees had priority over casual employees in bidding for any permanent position. If there were no qualified permanent employees who want to transfer into the position, then priority was determined between casual employees based on seniority amongst those who are qualified. The seniority lists were much in evidence before the Court."

It was clear that the accused was confused and not focused on the present and that his mind had wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial as opposed to his immediate right to have counsel. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty that the officer should have made an effort to clarify the informational component of the right to counsel.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault, use or threatened use of weapon and failure to comply with his recognizance of August 2, 2008 related to alcohol and weapon possession. The accused was given his Charter rights and was advised of his right to contact counsel without delay and on the more serious charges as he became almost immediately the suspect in the assault on the same street person as they were known to be heavy drinkers who shared the porch. After being detained, the accused returned to the porch, found the victim lying on the pew and assaulted him with a piece of iron rebar sending the victim to the hospital with a head injury. During the detention of the accused and his family, who had provided shelter during the day, one of the police officers asked the accused if he wanted to call a lawyer. When the police came to the accused's residence, they found the accused in a very intoxicated state, so that he could not stand up and needed two officers to escort him to the police car. He was taken to hospital by ambulance. The Crown appealed the dismissal of the charges. Appeal allowed; admission of the videotaped statement allowed. Although the accused was under the disability of severe addiction and did not intend to be cooperative witness, the police would have been required to clear up any misunderstanding he may have exhibited about his rights. Access to counsel is the gateway of Charter rights particularly in these circumstances where this statement is the only evidence to be offered by the Crown in seeking conviction. There is a low threshold of drunkenness, voluntariness and see no evidence of oppression, threats or promises at this juncture. This is a different situation than those involving guns and narcotics."
5_2004skca52.txt,"This was an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision the arbitrator interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and the respondent. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The interpretation of the arbitrator was a possible interpretation on a legal and grammatical analysis of the entire agreement, and was not patently unreasonable.","This is an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision of Arbitrator Ish interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and respondent. The judgment centered on a clause governing retroactive wage adjustments based on all paid hours with any employer. The appellant had argued that the phrase 'any employer' referred to the employer for whom the employee was working at the time of the agreement. On the other hand, the employer defended its employee benefits under the collective agreement. HELD: The appeal was dismissed orally. The court found that if the arbitrator was of the view, in the first portion of the paragraph, that analysis of one clause, using one tool, extrinsic evidence and onus would have been sufficient ratio to support his conclusion, he was in error and indeed a patently unreasonable error. This is an incorrect proposition of law. The arbitrator found the phrase in question to be ambiguous and outlined the reasons why each of the competing interpretations might be chosen. He then concluded in his ratio that: As a result of these competing aids to interpretation, there is no unambiguous one. The phrase is ambiguous and the appeal is dismissed."

The plaintiffs brought a claim in contract and tort alleging Hagblom caused a fire in their building. The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation. The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence. In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act.

To clarify its nature, the matter must be remitted to the Trial Judge. It is ordered that the matter will be subsumed in that application."

The child is the petitioner's son from a prior relationship. The petitioner plans to have the child live with his biological father in Edmonton so that he can get the specialized medical care that he requires. When the petitioner and the respondent separated, they consented to a judgment, which granted the petitioner custody of the child and gave access rights to the respondent. The consent judgment provided that the petitioner was to provide the respondent with 90 days notice of any proposed change in the child's residence. Notice of the upcoming move was provided to the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. The consent judgment does not require the petitioner to get an order before changing the child's residence. An application will be required by the petitioner to vary the access arrangements with the respondent.","The petitioner and the respondent were married in June 1999 and separated in January 2000. In 2002 a consent judgment was issued by the Court providing that the petitioner would have custody of their two children, aged 16 and 10 years, subject to an agreement with the respondent that the child would refer to the respondent as 'Doug' unless the child desires to do otherwise. In the last year the child has been experiencing problems at home and at school. The petitioner took the child to Dr. Verma in Swift Current who prescribed Ritalin, suspecting the child suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. The doctor in Saskatoon was not aware of the child's pending move to Edmonton. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing in the judgment referred to above requires the petitioner to obtain such an order. It only provides that the respondent receive 90 days' written notice. 2)It would be in the best interests for this child to be with his biological father in Edmonton where he would have immediate access to medical therapy, consultation with his psychiatrist and advanced modes of therapy including scholastic, which are only available in large centres. An application was required to vary the access arrangements with the father. Such an application was advised that such an application had now been served and will be heard in January."
4_1994canlii5226.txt,"The parties divided their matrimonial property in 1985 by agreement as confirmed in a consent order. The order provided that when the husband retired, the wife would receive, as her vested share of his pension, 40% of his benefit. The order also provided that the parties could apply for further directions as necessary. After the husband's retirement, the wife sought to receive her share of the pension from the employer as a lump sum. The husband objected, claiming that he was entitled to any remaining benefit from her share in the event she should predecease him. The wife applied for directions. HELD: The wife is entitled to her share of the pension in any form permitted by the terms of the pension plan. She is also entitled to leave her interest in the pension to a named beneficiary, without reference to or the consent of the husband.","The parties married in 1952 and were divorced in 1984. The matrimonial property was settled by the parties in 1985. A consent order giving effect to the vesting order in December 1985 stated that the applicant was to receive a vested interest in the pension to the extent described in the order. The applicant did not consent to the lump sum benefit as she perceived the pension plan arrangement to be something of tontine. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The court preferred to treat the application as one for an order interpreting the previous order and consequential declarations and directions. The order provided for vesting to the applicable extent, depending on future event, namely the date his retirement or the date of his death if it occurred before his retirement. 2)The 40% share, having vested in the applicant, is a share she may deal with without reference to,or the consent of, the applicant.

She relied upon Civil Procedure Rules 15.07 and 15.08. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's application was an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of past circumstances of the child rather than an assessment of her current circumstances. The proper remedy would be for the applicant to apply for a termination of the order under s. 48 of the Children and Family Services Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of a Family Court judge declining to rescind an order in 1993 for permanent care and custody of the appellant's granddaughter. The basis on which the application was made was that the appellant consented to or agreed with the 1993 order on the faith of the agency's then-president, who alone could not care for the child. Unfortunately, the adoption plans did not materialize and the appellant was hospitalized. She appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the Family Court is required under both the Family Maintenance Act and the Children and Family Services Act to issue orders which are judicially determined to be in the best interest of a child. This determination is not corollary or an adjunct to a previous proceeding but rather the main and most fundamental issue to be assessed by the court. There was no certainty that this court would or should have issued custody order under the Family maintenance Act even with the presentation of a consent order to such effect. Additionally, the grandmother relies upon Wood v. Wood (1982), 56 N.S.R. (2d) 217 (N.S.)S.C.) as authority to apply Civil Procedure Rule 15:07 and 15:08."

Expert evidence was given based on blood samples taken after the accident that the accused was impaired; this opinion was based on two assumptions, namely, that the accused had not consumed alcohol within half an hour of the accident, nor after the accident. The Crown did not offer any evidence to prove these assumptions and, in fact, there was a three hour period prior to the accident where there was no evidence of what the accused, who did not testify, was doing. Acquitting the accused, that the expert evidence cannot be tendered by the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had been impaired. The remainder of the evidence against the accused was insufficient to prove the accused's doubt beyond a reasonable doubt.","A 21 year old friend of the accused was charged with criminal negligence causing death after she observed a white vehicle go over the centre line of the highway by a few inches for approximately 20 seconds. The accused was later found to be the operator of the white vehicle. Viva voce evidence was heard at that time for the second and third counts. HELD: The Court held that the proof of impairment consists of observations of conduct in most cases and where the conduct is a slight departure from normal activity, it would be unsafe to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the ability to drive is impaired by alcohol or drugs.  1)The accused was found to have been operating a motor vehicle for approximately 3 hours prior to the accident. There was no indication of braking by the vehicle when it came into contact with the second vehicle. 2)The blood alcohol reading taken from the victim at the hospital at 12:10 p.m. was accurately recorded as 216 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.  3)The evidence was that the accused's condition was the only cause of her death or her injuries.  4)The Court rejected the defence's submission that the hospital technician was of the opinion that 47 millimoles of ethanol per litre of blood should be adduced from the reading of the victim and the purported extrapolation of that reading back to the time of the motor vehicle operation.  5)Since the accused has admitted to being the Operator of a white Corsica motor vehicle at the time that the vehicle came into collision with the vehicles operated by Joan Jeanette Little and Raelee Kane, the Court ordered a trial of this type of evidence.  6)Costs were awarded in the amount of $1,000 to the defence. 7)The plaintiff was awarded a credit for $500 in lost wages. 8)The defendant was found not guilty on the first count of the information because the underlying assumptions of the Crown had not been proven by the Court. 9)She was awarded credit for time served on the second count. 10)The balance of liability was awarded to the plaintiff for the costs of the trial. 11)The court reserved its decision for January 2001."
3_1999skqb140.txt,"An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","The only witnesses called at trial were the plaintiff and the defendant. The issue was whether the defendant had an obligation to the plaintiff, either in contract or equity for the lease payments on the vehicles and for the repairs to them for the period from September 1, 1993 until February 11, 1994. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1)There was no defence entered to the claim by either Redhead or the defendant, Standard, having been noted for default, into the claim for the outstanding lease payments and for parts and labour supplied by the defendant to these leased vehicles.  2)The plaintiff did not know how the repairs were authorized for Standard. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement.  3)The actions taken by both Redhead and Hyndman were taken for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational. As it turned out, neither Redhead nor the plaintiff benefited from this arrangement for very long and both lost money.  4)Costs were awarded to both parties. Although there was no specific contract with respect to the repair of the leased vehicles, it was clear that the defendant did make some payments on behalf of the plaintiff with regard to some work orders that were issued by the plaintiff. As a result, neither the plaintiff nor the defendant benefited from the arrangement for a very long time. Both lost money and both suffered.  5)The action against the defendant was dismissed with taxable costs.  6)Statutes and Debriefings Regarding the unpaid repairs, the plaintiff's evidence did not establish that the defendants had notice of the invoices, or that there was a purchase order number obtained from the defendant authorizing the repairs. The evidence indicated that the plaintiff gave notice to the defendant that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchasing order number once they realized there may have been a misapprehension by Standard's creditors with respectto the payment of these accounts.  7)The evidence of Duda was not established. Duda's evidence does not establish either the defendant's notice of certain invoicing and on what conditions. The defendant did not make any payments.  8)The defendant shall have taxable costs of the claim in the amount of $63,267.49."

In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs. There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict. The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct. The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal. The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause. HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed. The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct. There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance. The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract. Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed.

e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","The parties met, married, made children and then separated. The respondent father is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins. They have not settled a division of matrimonial property. Issues [1] What amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments? HELD: 1) The respondent's income is determined to be $29,983 and he shall pay the petitioner for the support of Reidar and Bronwyn, born December 1998 and the sum of $568 per month commencing October 1, 2005 and continuing every month thereafter until a child is no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985. 2) Personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses (vi) Capital cost allowance on real property owned by the partnership; and (vii) capital cost allowance are of significant interest to the respondent. He will be in a small credit position which he can offset against ongoing maintenance but in amount no greater than $50 per month so as not to cause any inappropriate financial hardship on the children. The Court found that in 2003, 2004 and 2005 the income of the father was approximately the same as in 2005. It would appear that the holding of trial was a more efficient and cheaper method of coming to conclusion regarding the issue of maintenance than ongoing negotiation or pre-trial. Each party achieved partial success in their approach and no costs were awarded to either party."

There was no voiry dire held to determine if the statement was voluntary. Dismissing the appeal, that the evidence of the Crown witnesses and the fact that the appellant had advised the officers of several places that they should look for stolen lobsters in the open ocean did not reach the appellant as they had presumed through their information that the lobsters had been purchased there.

Her solicitor/client bill exceeded $50,000 including very large disbursements as a trustee was appointed to preserve the property and the defendant solicitor's files were seized. An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention. Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.  1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared. Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties. 2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge. It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs. It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","FIAT. The defendant was in contempt of court orders requiring him to account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. A trustee was appointed, and the files of Bawolin were seized. Then an accountant prepared a forensic audit. All of this was very expensive. HELD: 1)Even if Siemens was substantially unsuccessful at trial in her allegations of wrongdoing by Wawolin, still he ought to pay these costs because he caused the expense of the pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. 2)This was the more appropriate route in the circumstances. When all the evidence is in, it may transpire that Siemens is in fact, indebted to Bawol as he now says, at the time of the contempt. 3)The Court ordered the defendant to pay forthwith the solicitor/client costs to be taxed."
8_2013skqb397.txt,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction. The applicants were trying to use habeas corpus when they actually were seeking a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies were available only through the Federal Court.","The applicants have brought an application for writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, seeking unconditional release from the Riverbend Minimum Institution due to a threat to their respective liberties claiming the Correctional Service of Canada has violated their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in not allowing them to reside in a common housing unit so that they can participate in their long-standing, same-sex relationship outside of the public domain. HELD: 1) The applicants should have followed the grievance process as it was the established process for offenders' redress when they felt they had been treated unfairly, or in a manner that was not consistent with their Charter rights. 2) It was obvious from the evidence the Court received concerning the applicants' physical and mental health and the Court's observations of Sinobert during the application that he was suffering from some kind of disability. These remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process."

The petitioner earned $48,000 per year. The wife did not work outside the home and suffered from severe arthritis. For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","The parties entered into a separation agreement for the purpose of increasing the maintenance provision and retaining the asset division. The husband argued that the agreement should be set aside as a whole, in part under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act; in dealing with maintenance under the Divorce Act; alternatively, the maintenance award was of such a low amount that it was unconscionable and harsh to bind the wife to such a arrangement. Awarding the wife $2,055.68, that in addition to the usual maintenance award of $1,200, the wife also received an amount of support from the husband in the amount of $5,000.00.

7_1995canlii5894.txt,"The Defendants applied to sever the issues of liability and damages for purposes of the trial of this matter. The trial was to be held before a jury.HELD: 1)The Court has a general discretion as to severance of issues which must be exercised judicially. 2)Severance should only be ordered when the judge has a serious reason to believe that the trial of the issue proposed to be severed will put an end to the action. 3)The Court accepted the Plaintiff's submission that expert medical evidence would be necessary to establish the cause of the accident since the Plaintiff had suffered brain damage and would be unable to testify. This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found. 4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages.

8_2008nssc358.txt,"The corollary relief judgment provided that the parties would share parenting of their two children approximately equally. Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue. Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms.","The former wife sought to vary the child support terms of the Corollary Relief Judgment, pursuant to s. 17 of the Divorce Act. The parties had an agreement that the parties would share joint custody of the children, with the husband to pay child support based on the income of the wife and the father to pay spousal support of $1,268 per month. The former wife opposed the application on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income rather than obtain employment. She argued that her RRSP income should not be considered when calculating child support, and asked the court to review the amount of child support paid back to the date of the last order. The Respondent denied this application. The court reviewed the circumstances since the granting of the order and found that there had not been any change in the pattern used by the parties since the separation and that undue hardship was not the reason to reduce the amount based on undue hardship. HELD: The court ordered the amount to be paid by the applicant within 60 days of October 15, 2008. Based on the information provided by the respondent, the Court was not convinced that the applicant would suffer undue hardship by having her share offset by the father's payment. The respondent's income for child support purposes in 2007 was $125,859, requiring child support payment of only $97 per month, although the former wife had increased her income in 2007 to $145,344.31 and had professional fees of $481.04 leaving her with a total income figure of $144,363.27 which would require child support payments for a two-and-a-half-year period."

The judge at preliminary inquiry concluded that there was evidence adduced that the accused had paid money to the man who had killed the victim the day after the killing, that she was involved in cleaning the apartment where the killing took place after the body was removed, and that the accused and the man who killed the victim had discussed the matter prior to the event, and thus there was sufficient evidence upon which a 'properly instructed jury may find...[the accused] guilty...' The appellant contended that the judge had applied the wrong test for committal. Dismissing the application, that the question is not whether the judge correctly verbalized the test, but rather if the evidence supported the committal, and there was, indeed, enough circumstantial evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed and acting reasonably in accordance with those instructions, could convict the accused of first degree murder.","This was an application by the Applicant for an order in the nature of Habeas Corpus and an order for certiorari in aid.

The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch. The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one. The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations. The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door. The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts. It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue.","HELD: The Charter application was dismissed. The court found that there was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of s. 27 of The Fisheries Act. The prohibition was unconstitutional in that it creates a reverse onus, infringing the right of the accused to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and is not saved by s. of the Charter. The Crown had conceded that the accused had a fishing licence, valid on its face, and had acted in compliance with it. The issue was whether the Minister had the authority under s. 13(4) of the Act to prohibit the accused from applying for or obtaining a licence. The fishing licence was issued in June 2009, issued in September 2008, and in September 2009, it was revoked by the Fisheries Board. In September of 2009, the accused went on a fishing trip to Waterbury Lake, along with his sister, Nicole, and their three small children. The accused was observed 'actively angling' numerous times between September 20 and September 25. He was stopped by conservation officers at Sask. Environment maintenance compound. RCMP executed a search warrant and seized numerous other items, including a stainless steel cooler with the accused's name scratched into it, a plastic food cooler and several other provisions of the Fisheries Act, including his fishing licence. In these circumstances, the prohibition would have taken effect on the day on which it was served by registered mail, which would have been the simplest way to prove the validity of the licence."

b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The mother applied to vary the father's maintenance for her daughters, Nicole and Kirsti. She also applied for determination that the father was in arrears of maintenance and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. The trial judge found that although the mother's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than their father's, they were still entitled to maintenance. The father discontinued child support in September 2006. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court found that the trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a relationship with the father and that there was no order for retroactive maintenance. As the mother had been unable to contact her father for many years, and the father had recently moved to Hong Kong, the Court found that it would not be just and equitable to require the father to pay the $26,730.54 child support owing to the daughter. The Court also found that unilateral withdrawal rarely stands alone as a factor disentitled to maintenance unless the situation is extremely grave."
d_2018skpc6.txt,"HELD: On the basis of the evidence presented by the parties’ experts and in absence of an express term in the contract, the court read in an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price and awarded the plaintiff such portion of the amount sought as was fair and reasonable. The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work.","Reliable Truck Trailer Inc. is a mobile vehicle and associated equipment repair company situated in Pense, Saskatchewan. In 2015 it entered into an oral agreement with Super Save, Inc., hereafter referred to as 'Super Save', in which it agreed to provide 'call out' services for Super Save's fleet of trucks and related equipment. Super Save paid Reliable's invoices as they were presented, but ceased to pay as they became due. Reliable was not prepared to accept the lesser amount and it now brings this action to recover the amount that it says is due. HELD: The plaintiff received some but not nearly all of the money that it was seeking. The defendant was successful in reducing the amount of money that was sought but not entirely. The plaintiff asks that this Court grant it out of pocket expenses that it incurred in having to retain an expert to give evidence on the issue of a fair and reasonable price. 1)The plaintiff is awarded the sum of $1,550.85 which is to be paid immediately. 2)In businesses such as the plaintiff's, the industry anticipates that either travel time to and from the work location is regularly billed and paid for or alternatively, that minimum period of time is charged for the goods and services, based not necessarily on what either party had thought were the respective rights and obligations of the other, but rather, based on the evidence of experts who played no role in the provision of those goods. The estoppel by convention argument advanced by the plaintiff is advanced. It was only in November of 2015 that the defendants felt that they were being charged too much. There is only an assertion which an industry would consider to be customary."
c_1996canlii5370.txt,"This was an application by the defendants to set aside a default judgment entered against them by the plaintiff. Although a statement of claim was served on the defendant, it's insurer was advised by the plaintiff's counsel that she would not proceed to judgment except on 10 days written notice. More than six months later plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to the defendant's insurer giving 10 days notice. This letter was not seen by him although he was in the process of putting together material for a solicitor to file a defence. The defendant had always advised the plaintiff that it intended to defend. No Notice of Intention, required for default judgment if six or more months had elapsed since the last step in the proceeding, was ever given to the defendant before the filing of the default judgment. Allowing the application and setting aside the default judgment, that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse on the part of the defendant for not filing the defence. Sending a letter to the insurer does not satisfy the requirement of filing a Notice of Intention to proceed. The fact that the prothonotary did not object to the request for default judgment without the Notice is immaterial.","This was an application for an order setting aside a default judgment entered against the defendant municipality in February 1996. The plaintiff claimed that a mudslide occurred during the road construction causing extensive damage to her property.

The defendant denied the existence of any servants or employees of the Town who supervised the work and the claim was for lost rentals, emotional upset and anxiety. Granting the application with costs, that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse for not filing the defence. The failure to file notice of intention to proceed was not mere technicality as it was granted by the Prothonotary and not by the Court."
6_2010skqb51.txt,"The Bankrupt applies for his discharge from bankruptcy. The discharge is opposed by the Credit Union and the trustee. The Bankrupt was a cattle farmer. He financed this undertaking principally through the Credit Union. HELD: The Bankrupt will be discharged conditional upon payment of $8,000 in addition to surplus income of $2,250 to his estate for the benefit of his creditors. He should be able to comply with this order within 3 years.  1) The bankrupt is 42 years old and a first time bankrupt. He is employed with an excavating company and earns $20 an hour and works as much as 160 hours per week. He is paying $1,000 per month on his mortgage and is trying to catch up on mortgage arrears to stave off foreclosure. He is working hard and living a subsistence life. However, he still has some funds left with an income level above the Superintendent's Standard for a family of two. 2) His assets are less than $.50 on the dollar. His creditors were put to the unnecessary expense by his frivolous or vexatious defence of their claim and he failed to comply with the duties of a bankrupt by failing to produce proper records and assist the trustee to the fullest. He has been abusive and disrespectful throughout.","The bankrupt applied for his discharge from bankruptcy. His statement of affairs showed assets of $171,255 (mostly exempt or encumbered) against unsecured debts totalling $433,750 and secured debt of $150,000. The bankruptcy judge adjourned the application sine die and fiat issued requiring further disclosure. The bankrupt asserted a security interest over the equity pursuant to s173(1)(d) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. He argued that the drought, which had occurred five or six years prior to his assignment, had resulted in his inability to grow sufficient feed for his cattle operation and he was forced to purchase cattle feed at great expense. He also claimed that he sold cattle in the year prior to bankruptcy because it simply amounted to a sale of inventory in the ordinary course of business and the BIA imposed no duty on the trustee to examine the bankrupt's farming records in the five year period preceding bankruptcy. HELD: The bankrupt was granted an absolute discharge of bankruptcy conditional upon payment of $10,250 composed of $2,250 for surplus income and $8,000 for payment to his estate for the benefit of his creditors. The court found the bankrupt to be evasive, uncooperative and un-attentive. He spoke strongly and passionately on his behalf and claimed to have been insolvent since 2002. He had one son from a previous relationship who did not currently reside with him. He claimed to be employed with an excavating company earning $20 per hour and working as much as 160 hours per week but claimed to own cattle and farm equipment. He sold his cattle in lieu of cash as a means of retiring debts owed to them and claimed that his operation was a 'lifestyle choice' for him. The Court awarded him judgment in the amount of $91,126.29. As the bankrupt was a self-employed rancher, he was entitled to his day in court and to be heard by an impartial decision maker, but the Court held that it would be unfair and unjust to allow him to receive his discharge without making a sizeable contribution to his creditors' trust fund in order for him to obtain his discharge. The onus is on the objecting creditor to prove the existence of s173 in the Act if it is not otherwise reported by the trustee. Having carefully considered all of the facts and considering the circumstances before and after the bankruptcy, the Court found it appropriate to impose a conditional order of discharge."
e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court held that the chambers judge erred in failing to address the question of whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(f) of the Guidelines. The only issue on this appeal is the order that the appellant pay 73% of the children's extracurricular activities, which are covered by the basic child support order of $2,532 per month. The appeal is dismissed. The chambers judge did not specifically say that he considered these to be extraordinary expenses but must have found that roughly half of these activities were ordinary, which means the respondent is expected to pay the cost of the ordinary activities out of her income, including the child support that she receives monthly. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chamber judge."
c_2002skqb508.txt,"A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","This is a motion for judicial review of the decision of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board (""the Board""). The Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of certain food services at the University of Saskatchewan. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties had failed. The employer had advised the Board that it was not prepared to make the agreement retroactive. HELD: The motion was dismissed. The Board's decision to favour the union and make the wage increases fully retroactive was patently unreasonable. It would be unsound to base entitlement to retroactive benefits on the serendipitous signing of a collective agreement or the signing of Board decision imposing one."

At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order. If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3). Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who committed multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or altogether.","The Crown appealed the sentencing judge's order under s.490.012(1) of the Criminal Code, which directed the accused to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) for 20 years. The accused was convicted on each of four charges of sexual assault. As the Crown proceeded by indictment, he was subject to imprisonment for term not exceeding ten years on each conviction. He was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 4 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA prohibition order and a 20 year SOIRA compliance order. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed. The narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who commits multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or all together. 1)The plain meaning of the section is that there is no need to resort to other principles of statutory interpretation; however, if it were necessary to do so, the plain meaning interpretation of the s.485.012 as not applying in circumstances where sentence is concomitantly pronounced for multiple 'designated offence' convictions and the offender's criminal record discloses no prior convictions for a 'designation offence' such as this one. 2) The Court of Appeal does not agree with the sentence judge's interpretation of s.(2) 490.012. The meaning of this section is plain: offenders who commit multiple designated acts will be subject to a lifetime S.IRA compliant order. Nothing in the Code suggests the lifetime duration of the order rests on the offender being sentenced separately for each offence. 3) S.485(2) applies for life if the person is convicted of, or found not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder for, more than one offence referred to in paragraph (a), (c) or (d) or the definition of a designated offence in s.476.011(1). Sexual assault is adesignating offence under s.(1) and where an offender is convicted as a result of a previous court order requiring the same sentence as that made pursuant to s.502.013 of the Code. S.476(2)(b) does not include an order requiring a repeat offender to register for sex or a DNA offence. 4) The duration of a S.500.012 compliance order is determined by reference to s.(3) The judge in this case declined to order"
8_2006skqb274.txt,"DIGEST The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000. HELD: 1) The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents. The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public. The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry. This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.  2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000. The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'. Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit. 3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.","The appellants were convicted by a Queen's Bench trial judge of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and the Health Of Animals Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and obstructing inspectors.

b_2004skqb156.txt,"The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle. There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3) Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.

Non-earners in the past may well become someone whose employment income, but for the accident, would be more than the 'weighted average approach'. 3) The earning reality of the appellant was working for employment income no more than half the time. He would have worked, on average, 90 of the 180 days. The reduction in the period of employment be reduced to factor in inclement weather is not required. 4) The issue is determining the time that Montgrand would have actually been employed and that finding has been made. If it is greater, Montgrand has the benefit provided by s. 117(4). 5) SGI submits that the weighted average approach in calculating Montgrand's gross yearly employment income (GYEI) sets the IRB much lower.

6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","The issue for the court was whether Tristen was a child of the marriage as defined by the Divorce Act (and, if so, what his obligation to pay child support should be). The parties married in 2001 and separated in 2008. The parenting and support issues concerning the biological child have been resolved. The respondent has a child, born April 3, 2004. The issues are the biological son of the respondent and the respondent, and whether the respondent stands in the place of parent within the meaning of the Act. HELD: The threshold for parental status finding is set at a sufficiently high point that it avoids the imposition of obligations and the acquisition of custody rights except where the respondent has intentionally acted or can be inferred to have acted so as to substantially replace the natural parent's role. The child's relationship with his natural parent (the respondent) has ceased and suggests that his contact with the other is increased due to the 'armed stand-off'."

In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery.

Each of the defendants furnished a draft order. Each defendant's application was to issue as an order of the court, save and except for the request for costs in the cause. It would be premature to award costs. The trial judge will be able to see the reply to demands for particulars and be better positioned to assess the merits of these motions than I was able to infer from the material presently before the court."
5_2002skqb378.txt,"All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old. The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.","The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the respondent pay ongoing support for his granddaughter of $293 per month. The parties had been unable to reach an agreement regarding child support and had proceeded to trial. The issues before the Court were: 1) child support including s. 7 expenses; s. 8 expenses; and whether the child support order should be made retroactive. 2) costs. HELD: The respondent's income for child support purposes was $35,269.44 and he was ordered to pay 59% of the child's expenses as they are incurred. The child care expenses incurred in this case did not meet the requirements set out in the Guidelines. There was no blameworthy conduct on the part of the respondent."

The trustee had tried to sell the real property for year. HELD: The vesting order was granted. 1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so. In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87. 2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor. The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price. The registered owner had taken no opposition. No other interests will be adversely affected. 3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment.","FIAT. The Receiver for theRegistered Owner applied for a vesting order under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to register title in favour of the proposed purchaser of the real property.

Counsel requested the opportunity to address the concerns raised and to make supplementary submission in support of its application. Based upon the submissions now received, the Court was satisfied that the jurisdiction was retained by s86 of the Act, which was not reintroduced by the new regulations. 2) The applicant was granted judgment in Clarkson v.

The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","The parties were married in 1986 and separated in 1995. The primary issue between the parties is custody of their four children. Ancillary to and dependent upon the determination of the custody issue, is the quantum of child support that will be payable by either party. Matrimonial property owned by the parties at the time of separation has largely been divided between them to their mutual satisfaction. However, in making an order for custody pursuant to the Divorce Act, the court must take into consideration only the best interests of the children as determined by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of those children. HELD: The children were in the joint custody of the parties and they resided an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. 1) The uncontradicted evidence indicated that the most important consideration for these children is stability. That stability is found in their father's home. The children are bonded to their mother. 2) There was no evidence of the increased costs of shared custody such that consideration could be given to s. 9(b) of the Guidelines. It is in their best interests that they be removed from an environment that offers them the stability that they require nor from the specialized educational opportunities available to them in Saskatoon."
c_2016skqb269.txt,"HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","The accused is charged with failing to ensure the health and safety of its employee by failing to instruct him on how to unplug a small pit in a grain terminal. In the course of repair to a large fan, an employee was injured by the moving fan blade. The incident occurred when the employee was in the process of unplugging a receiving pit in the terminal. The employee later died of suffocation. HELD: The Court found that the accused failed to adequately supervise the employee and failed to provide proper training and supervision to ensure that the employee exercised due care and diligence to avoid the contravention. The Court of Appeal did not accept the Crown's position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proves the actus reus of failing to protect an employee. The evidence of the employee who suffered a serious injury was found to be unreliable. The accused was acquitted of all counts.

c_2011nssc20.txt,"The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson. They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","Two of the plaintiffs were injured in a single vehicle accident while passengers in the other plaintiff were in a vehicle driven by the defendant. Both were paid damages for the injuries they sustained. Both signed releases acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were paid their damages. Both appeared to have understood the terms of the settlement and agreed to it voluntarily. Both stated that they should not now expect to be compensated further, particularly where to pursue a claim could result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. This is indeed what could result based on the defence filed on behalf of GMCL. The defendant moved for summary judgment, dismissing the claims of the two plaintiffs and allowing the plaintiff to proceed with their own. To allow the plaintiff's action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process."
1999skqb29.txt,"In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent. The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings. The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","FIAT. The applicants sought an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development and from further considering an application for discretionary use permit by Kathy and Gary Palidwar for private hotel development connected with the community facility known as the Evergreen Centre. HELD: The application was granted in part. The respondents were hoteliers who operate five of the six hotels and motels within the community and who have joined together in an informal association. The proposal appeared to elicit some support but the proposal was not disclosed for two weeks. During that time no action was taken by the council, although the members may have given thought to the proposal, something which they were entitled to do. A formal decision to actually facilitate the hotel development did not occur until June 14, 1999 when a resolution was passed to offer to sell land to the applicants. Prior to that, the applicants had made their representations in opposition to the project. In each instance the fact of the 'in camera' meeting was recorded and the Council's consequent action was made part of the public record."
2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","The appellant sought a declaration to strike the appellant's claim under s. 36 of the Constitution Act. The chambers judge struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. The appellant appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the court found that, in the context of this appeal, the claim should be struck only if they appear to be absolutely unsustainable or certain to fail; the proposed interpretation offered by the appellant was simply too vague. The court found: 1)The appellant had failed to demonstrate a justiciable commitment on the part of the federal government and the provinces; and 2)It was clear the motion to strike was not taken lightly. The Chambers judge did not answer the question of whether or not Apotex's proposed interpretation was 'worth considering' or whether it had a chance of success; nor did the Attorney General reach her own conclusion on the disputed point of statutory interpretation. That is an error on her part."

Plaintiff awarded commission of 4% as agreed to by the terms of the oral contract; in the alternative, the plaintiff is entitled to an award for unjust enrichment to compensate for the work done. Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable. An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties.","The plaintiff obtained an oral agreement for the payment of a fixed commission, there were definite terms, that the oral agreement was enforceable but in the alternative an award of unjust enrichment was made to compensate for work done.

e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The Court found the petitioner’s Federal Child Support Guidelines to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support for D.K. in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal and child support of $5,250.00 per month. The petitioner had not taken a single vacation in the preceding two years and, as a result, claimed that the respondent had now unilaterally transferred their son, who was now residing in the U.S., to Saskatchewan. The respondent, who had recently commenced a pediatric critical care fellowship, had not been able to find a job in Canada and had intended, in the end, to pursue his chosen career, which he now believed was a career in medicine. The child had been attending a Montessori school for the past few months and, during this time, he was required to remain at the hospital every day. He also shared a residence with his sister (who was also a high school student) and their son (who resided in Regina at the time of his birth). The parties resided in a condominium in Regina and, after a series of temporary separations, they moved to Saskatoon, where the petitioner continued to reside with their son.

7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act (PPSA). The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the financer held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that it became a tenant at sufferance when it failed to remove the building and was obliged to pay rent. The Credit Union appealed. Appeal allowed; the trial judge's award effectively disregards the priority provisions of s. 36 and substitutes a new remedy for the rights expressly set out in ss. 36(9) to (16) of the PPSA. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs to the credit union and to the general damages claim. 1)The trial judge erred in dismissing the application. The fact that the building was sold to a third party in the spring of 2001 and was not removed from the property until the fall of 2002 did not disqualify Gari from the action. It would have been improper for Gari to deny permission to removal of the Building unless the credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Denying a remedy in that situation would put persons with interests in land at an unfair disadvantage vis-à-vis financers and would allow financers to effectively'store' fixtures on the property of others at no cost. 2)The plaintiff did not advance a claim either in trespass or pursuant to s. 65(5) or unjust enrichment as it generally gives priority to a financer over financer of goods as it affects the individual with an interest in land and vice versa. The analysis of the positions of the parties must proceed on that same basis, i.e. on the same basis that as of September 1, Gari was seeking security for possible damage caused by removal of a Building but was not seeking rent and reimbursement for taxes paid."
2_2011skqb102.txt,"The Crown appealed the respondent's acquittal on a charge of driving over .08. The Crown alleged that the trial judge erred in law by excluding two breath samples taken following the respondent's arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter of Rights. During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence. HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered. The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter. The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted as a full exhibit and became part of the Crown's case. The Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt in all respects.","The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of impaired driving. The Crown claims the learned trial judge erred in law in excluding two breath samples taken after the arrest of the accused on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) While the trial judge was aware that an analysis of the reasonable and probable grounds (i.e. that the accused had consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood) could not defeat her objective demand, the breathalyzer technician testified that she had personally observed the accused make a U-turn and was of the opinion that he was showing signs of impairment and she concluded that his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 2) The accused was cooperative and gave up the keys to his vehicle. He was unable to locate his documentation in the truck despite extensive searching. 3) The officer did not observe any improper driving when she first observed the pickup truck or when she pursued it and it pulled over to stop. The officer noted no other swaying or difficulty in the short observation period between the stop and demand. The readings were 110 mg/% and 100 mg/%. The accused displayed signs of confusion, his speech was slurred at times, he had an odour of alcohol on his breath and he was confused as indicated by his inability to orient himself.  4) The trial judge did not question the credibility of either of the officers."
d_2016skca156.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure.","The accused, who was convicted of conspiring with others to traffic in cocaine, applied for judicial interim release pending his appeal. In the weeks immediately before the trial, Crown counsel disclosed the existence of approximately 1,900 documents. The Crown sought to have the trial adjourned for a further day to allow proper review of the documents. During that time, defence counsel also requested that the trial be set aside and new trial ordered. HELD: The application to adjourn the trial was granted. The Court found that to allow the conviction to stand in the face of all relevant circumstances would amount to a miscarriage of justice as the accused could not demonstrate that late and non-disclosure affected his right to make full answer and defence. As the accused had disclosed the documents to defence counsel, the Court was in the same position as the trial judge and could not assess the undisclosed documents to determine whether the undisclosed information could have affected the verdict. A new trial was the only remedy available."
d_2006nssc26.txt,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.",The plaintiff claimed damages for a motor vehicle accident that occurred as a result of the negligence of the defendant in the operation of a police vehicle referred to herein as the 'police vehicle'. The plaintiffs claimed the defendant's headlights were not in operation when it approached the intersection and that the plaintiff was contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning without turning on the headlights. The second issue was whether the plaintiffs were contributory to the accident. HELD: The plaintiff was found liable. The court found that the defendant was not qualified to express his opinion on the issue of liability. It did not find the destruction of the exhibits to be bad faith. The defendant was found to have made a mistake but not for the purpose of permitting the defendants to gain advantage over the plaintiffs. The plaintiff is found to be contributory in the action against the defendants.
2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","The wife had been left in poverty by the departure of the breadwinner in whose name most of the family assets were habitually held. In many cases she was left with nowhere to live. Under the provisions of s.22 of The Matrimonial Property Act, 1997, it was recognized that most often the young children of a previous marriage remain in the custody of the mother and so discretion was given to judge to ameliorate the equal division regime which the registration imposed. HELD: The wife was awarded $1,945 plus an award of $5,000. 1)The matrimonial home was divided equally. Before the 21 month marriage the wife was given one-half of the only asset the family had. They would either have to assume a large mortgage or move out of their modest $60,000 home or to rental accommodation.  2)The wife's new home, jointly owned with her mother as protection for 'in case he meets someone' is exempt property.  3)Had she not filed a counter petition there would have been no division, no trial and no excessive legal costs.  4)The court considered and rejected arguments that involved calculation of the precise value of the personal properties because the evidence was not reliable, there was an appearance of equality as noted above, and the claim was in its entirety inequitable. It was to the credit of the wife that she conceded that her claim for 50% of the equity was perhaps unfair (i.e. inequitable) and that 25% would do. However the claimant was even better off if given the $25,000 or so that he had claimed against the home."
b_1990canlii4176.txt,"This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff had worked for 28 years for the defendant as a driver making deliveries to customers. The defendant dismissed the plaintiff for 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The plaintiff had taken longer coffee and lunch breaks than were allowed, and had taken unauthorized breaks for which he had then been paid overtime by the defendant. For the defendant, that the dismissal was justified. The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules.","The plaintiff was employed by Sears as driver and driver's helper for 28 years. He was dismissed from the position without notice in 1988. He claimed that the breaks and breaks he took were for his meal and were part of a 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The issue was whether the defendant was justified in dismissing the plaintiff for his failure to abide by company policy with respect to breaks and overtime. HELD: The plaintiff's dismissal was justified. The defendant was found to have mischaracterized the reasons for his dismissal as being deliberate, dishonest and tantamount to theft. There was no reasonable excuse offered for the breaches of the policies. The plaintiff knew that these breaks were justified on the basis of productivity and knew they were necessary to ensure the company's survival. However, he was not given sufficient warning that termination would result if he failed to comply with company policy. As for the implications of breaking the rules sufficiently serious to justify termination, the plaintiff's breach of the rule was willful disobedience."
5_2011nssc53.txt,"A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate. In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister. The parties will bear their own costs. There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded. As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here. The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid. The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation? In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","The father, who claimed a one-half interest in a condominium held jointly by his parents until the death of his mother, sought party and party costs against his son. The father and his daughter were now acting on their own. HELD: The application was not 'estate litigation'; rather, it was litigation between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them. The purpose of an award of costs is to provide the successful party with partial but substantial indemnity against legal fees measured by what would ordinarily be charged to client for the kind of work undertaken on behalf of a successful party in the actual case. The three parties will bear their own costs.  1) It was necessary for the estate to participate in the application because it originally involved questions about Mrs. Hand's property, it involved demand for accounting, and the late Mr. Thomas Burchell, Q.C., was subpoenaed to give evidence about both the administration of the estate and the wills he drafted. 2) The entire application was sham and that no lawyer should be paid anything. There was also an issue about the failure of the representatives of the Hand's estate to provide an accounting. That was resolved only as the hearing began. 3) The central issue in the father's application was the meaning of his daughter's Will. She clearly made a gift to him that failed. The possibility of that failure was brought to the attention of the mother before she executed the will. However, the issue was one between the applicant and his father. Was Dr. Hand required to stand by his 1999 will, including the gift of the condominium to his son? No. Hand was represented in his personal claim by Mr. Piercey who had no involvement with the issues about estate accounting."
b_2010skqb249.txt,"The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","HELD: The court found the plaintiff had proven that he was defamed and accepted the defendants' defence of qualified privilege. The court ordered that none of the parties should receive costs. The plaintiff's claims were unfounded and without substance. He paid almost $14,000 in legal fees to facilitate his immigration to the United States and accepted expert's evidence that he had not been perturbed by the doctor on a personal basis. The doctor had been the director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) for four years and was the person ultimately responsible for insuring a harassment free workplace. The hospital administrator had completely failed in his duty to provide an adequate workplace environment. The physician had been an active participant in the harassment himself. The words of the grievance accused the doctor of refusing to prevent harassment and also of taking an active part in it. He was found to be an intentional infliction of mental anguish on his employees and the defendants had failed in their duty to ensure that such employees' return to the workplace was conducted in a fashion that would accord with the plaintiff's reasonable expectation of protection."
8_1998canlii13830.txt,"An appeal of conviction on a charge of dangerous driving on the grounds the trial judge erred in holding that statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in the criminal proceedings; and in holding the statements could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police and therefore were voluntary and admissible. The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement. Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal. Objections to the admissiblilty of the accused's statements based upon the Charter raise a different issue and considerations from the application of common law principles and a different conclusion may have been reached.","The appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge concluded that the statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in criminal proceedings. A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of certain statements. At issue was whether or not the highway traffic act obligation to give a report to the police renders any statement made during the report involuntary. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial in the Provincial Court was ordered. 1)Had the Charter issues been properly raised and arguedbefore the learned trial judge, a conclusion different from the one reached (based solely upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness) may have resulted. 2)Had a trial been properly held and argued before the learned judge, such a conclusion as one reached by the Court of Appeal in Pelletier (1995), 97 C.C.C.(3d) 139, would have resulted in a different conclusion. 3)The trial judge erred in holding that the appellant's statements were not voluntary. The statement that notwithstanding the evidence of Constable Louvel already referred to she was not aware of the reason why Mr. Chow attended at the police station and gave the information, and she testified that it was his understanding that the accused did so to give an accident report. Had the trial judge's conclusion been based solely upon common law concepts of voluntariiness and not on fact-based considerations, such an appeal might have resulted rather than a conclusive conclusion. 4)A new trial would be ordered."

9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","The accused was charged with dangerous driving causing death. HELD: The accused was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for 90 days. 1)The accused had consumed significant quantity of alcohol and was in no shape to drive. His actions were clearly inappropriate and imprudent and his failure to monitor and perceive the situation in front of him was a contributing factor. 2)Although the accused had been involved in a night of drinking and partying without sleep, his driving was not extremely erratic or bizarre. He was aware he was driving a vehicle that was mechanically unsound and took the risk. It was significant to note that in almost all of the instances the accused was consuming alcohol and the consumption of alcohol appeared to be either the major cause or contributing factor to the fatality. 3)A sentence of imprisonment was imposed in the community where the offence occurred."
9_2008skqb301.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT: The parties reached an impasse on the required disclosure and sought various orders. The defendants sought an order for the Court to exercise its discretion and sever the plaintiffs' claim between liability and damages and an order that certain paragraphs of the plaintiff's claim be struck. The plaintiffs and defendants by counterclaim applied pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 215(1) for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages and the defendants' breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract. HELD: The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages was dismissed. The court considered the effect of disclosure on promoting settlement between the parties. The issues in this litigation are such that delay in full disclosure of material pertaining to damages makes little difference. Both parties know the profitability of the SR&ED consulting business. The risks that must be weighed in considering a settlement pertain to liability. Those risks have not changed by granting the defendants their application.  1) The defendants were granted their application to have the plaintiffs claim severed so that the threshold point of liability could be tried prior to requiring the defendants to disclose and be discovered on the issue of damages. The defendant argued that, unless the lawsuit was bifurcated between liability/damages and liability and discovery, the disclosure required by the defendants of its present business records and names of clients would seriously prejudice it. 2) The court reviewed the relevant case law and found there was no evidence of extraordinary prejudice to the plaintiffs. 3) The Court considered Chaban's decision and found that the Alberta Court considered the application under its Rules of Court pertaining to the contents of the defendant's affidavit of documents. The Court found that this was a case where the Court's inherent jurisdiction rested with it.  4) The granting of the order was appropriate. While other provinces, such as Ontario, have specific rules addressing the withholding of disclosure until after an issue has been determined, our court has found that such authority now rests with our inherent jurisdiction."
d_2016skpc19.txt,"HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with possession of child pornography, contrary to s. 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code. The accused was a member of the RCMP Internet Child Exploitation Unit (ICE) and testified that he monitored file sharing networks for subjects who were accessing, possessing, or sharing child pornography using file sharing software. The ICE unit was involved in the investigation. The Court found that the accused had access to child pornography through a router. The router was used to direct traffic between the residence and the residence. As the residence was often visited by persons accessing the centralized server model, it is not possible for the data to end up at some other device because of the internal IP of the computer and the physical MAC address of the particular computer."
7_2013skqb67.txt,"The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","In Tucker-Lester v. Lester, the court canvassed the principles underly settlement privilege. The court noted that settlement privilege is a jointly held privilege which cannot be waived by any one party acting alone. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit of October 2012. The petitioner does not oppose the respondent remaining in the home on a time limited basis and suggests it should terminate June 27, 2013. HELD: The respondent has costs fixed in the amount of $500. 1) The parties have three children. They now have shared parenting arrangement and the petitioner seeks an order for interim exclusive possession of the family home. The parties agree that the meeting is without prejudice. 2) While it may be that parties in a settlement meeting reach a consensus on a number of issues, each parent is assumed to receive their entitlement to the child tax benefit. While they may have reached an agreement on seven issues, they did not reach agreement on all issues. The Court must be guided by the factors set out in the Divorce Act and the specific facts of the situation at hand. Having regard to the cashflow of the parties, the Court ordered that the last three sentences of para. 4 and para. 5 are struck. The Local Registrar is directed to remove them from the court file."
a_1995canlii4000.txt,"The Appellant/Defendant, Bennett appealed a judgment resulting from a jury trial. At trial, the Plaintiff had been awarded damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendant limited her appeal to the amount awarded for future loss of earnings. The Respondent/Plaintiff cross-appealed on the issue of whether the trial judge should have directed the jury to deduct sick leave benefits from her past loss of income. Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","Following a jury trial of this action for damages for personal injuries and loss sustained in an automobile collision, a verdict was pronounced awarding damages of $409,251.18 to the respondent. The appellant contended that the trial judge erred in law in failing to caution the jury regarding the weight to be given to the testimony of Douglas Kalesnikoff as expert opinion evidence. HELD: 1)The respondent was 35 years old. She obtained employment as a resident attendant or nursing aide in a nursing home. She later became a registered nurse. She was rendered unconscious and remained in a state of post-traumatic amnesia for approximately 4 hours. The trial judge allowed the respondent to testify as to her past loss of income but restricted her testimony on the basis that she was still employed. The respondent's testimony was found to be inconsistent with the evidence. 2)No substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice was demonstrated but in the absence of agreement between the parties the Court was limited to dismissing the appeal or ordering a new trial. 3)The appellant's claim was that she had permanent injury, and permanent pain which limited her ability to perform certain jobs and limited her future loss of homemaking. She questioned the appropriateness of using a 3% discount rate in calculating damages. 4)The trial judge was correct in finding that the respondent's future income capacity was so diminished that it was perverse, wholly out of proportion, unsupported by the evidence and unreasonable. 5)The award for lost wages was restricted to $5,553.18 for a total of $425,937.18. 6)There was no clear medical evidence that the petitioner had diminished ability to earn income in the future, or that it might have been reduced in the amount of $337,130.00. There was uncontradicted evidence of partial permanent physical disability which could have an effect on her employment."

e_2001nssc162.txt,"The defendant made an addition to single family residence. Following a dispute between the parties as to whether the defendant's use of the property now complied with the plaintiff's land-use bylaw for a single family residence, a consent order was issued dealing with the structure of the property and how it would be used. The plaintiff sought a finding that the defendant was in contempt of the consent order, seeking enforcement of the provisions of the consent order and an order that the defendant pay a fine. Defendant found in contempt of consent order; fine ordered in the amount of $10,000; if defendant has not complied with the terms of the consent order by January 31, 2002, the Sheriff is ordered to enter the property and receive the rents, profits and income thereof until the defendant clears his contempt; the door and hardware between the original structure and the addition is be removed; any references to separate apartments are to be removed from the property; the second power meter is to be removed from the property and the second cable television connection and associated billing provisions are to be eliminated; the defendant is to provide within 15 days the names of all tenants and if and when there are changes in any of the tenants, he must provide the plaintiff with the particulars of the new and remaining tenants; all tenants must be notified in writing prior to entry of occupation that the entire structure and building is only to be occupied as a single dwelling unit; copies of any written leases are to be provided to the plaintiff within 15 days of their execution; the plaintiff can enter the premises for the purposes of random inspection on a bi-monthly basis until the plaintiff is satisfied that this Order has been complied with and thereafter, the plaintiff is entitled to inspect the premises at random once a month while the defendant remains the owner of the property; the fine will not be crystallized into a judgment and execution if the defendant complies fully with all the requirements of this order on or before January 1, 2002. The plaintiff is entitled to solicitor-client costs.","The owner of a rental property applied for a variance to convert the existing use to a two unit dwelling without changing the side yard requirements. The proposal failed and the owner was fined $25,000. HELD: The dwelling was in contravention of the Halifax Regional Municipality's Land Use By-laws. A fine was not to be crystalized into a Judgment and Execution if the owner fully complied with all the requirements of the Order. 1)The owner did not consented to the order. He was to provide a copy of the lease to the municipality's officials within fifteen days of its execution or any alternation in the lease or the rental obtained was of a higher level than might have been otherwise without the breach. 2)The Court found that the owner had done absolutely nothing to purge the deliberate contempt of the January 9th, 2001 order. The proper exercise of discretion is to recognize the extraordinary circumstances that exists, willfulness of the contempt and the failure at any effort to purge requires an award of solicitor and client costs. 3)The inspection frequency was limited to twice a month and bi-monthly inspections were to continue until the City was satisfied that the order had been complied with. 4)The fines were to be taxed at a rate of $10,000 which would save the administration costs of the fine."
2_2001nssc171.txt,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The lease between the Landlord and the Tenant contained an arbitration clause. The Tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to that clause quashed. The issues were: 1) Did the loss occur as a result of the acts or omissions of the Tenants or its servants and agents; was the loss covered by insurance and whether notification or claim was required; if so, was estoppel and whether insurance should have covered the damages. 2) Was the arbitration clause a limited arbitration clause? Had it been a case, in the face of a strong privative clause, that it was immune from judicial review, even if patently unreasonable? 3) If so, what was the extent of the damages? Estoppel should not be limited to the wording of the clauses of the lease. Where there is an error going to jurisdiction, judicial review is the proper remedy. The more specialized the tribunal the less inclined the courts should be to be to interfere with its awards. Here the courts in both directions agree that the standard of review is correctness with respect to the issue of jurisdiction. The arbitrator was not limited to interpreting the words in the lease but could deal more broadly with the clauses and their contents. The disputes were the result of acts or errors of the tenants and the landlords. The parties did not provide that all disputes between the parties are to be settled by arbitration, but only disputes with regard to clauses or provisions of a lease. There is no jurisdiction to resolve a claim such as this which arises from the landlord/tenant relationship itself and not the clause and provisions of the leases."
c_1999canlii12484.txt,"In issue was whether the law firm was in a conflict of interest with respect to two matrimonial files and whether the firm could remain as counsel for the spouses. HELD: 1)A lawyer with Olive Waller acts as counsel for Janie Magnes and Daniel L'Heureux. The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm. At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes. She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses. 2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case. There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur. There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening. Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her. The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet. The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter. The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs.","This was an application for a determination as to whether the law firm of Olive, Waller, Zinkhan & Waller is in a position of conflict of interest with respect to the matrimonial files.

e_2012skpc43.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with operating while over.08 contrary to ss.255(1), 253(3) and ss.253(1). The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: 1) Based on the totality of the above evidence, it was objectively reasonable for the officer to conclude that the accused was impaired. The Court held that any breach of s.8 or s.9 of the Charter or the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 2) The officer subjectively believed that he had reasonable ground to arrest the accused for impaired driving and to make demand for breath samples. If the grounds fell short objectively, the accused displayed very significant symptoms of impairment and drove in fashion indicative of a marked departure from the norm. This is not a situation where there was nothing to substantiate the subjective belief held by the officer; what was lacking was a smell of or admission of consumption of alcohol. The officer was not wilful or reckless in their disregard of Charter rights. The evidence in question was reliable and was obtained in non-invasive manner. The admission of the evidence would enhance rather than detract from the public interest in the truth seeking function of the criminal trial process. The balance would weigh in favour of admission on this line of inquiry. 3) It is well settled that there is a subjective and objective component to finding that reasonable grounds exist within the meaning of s254(3). Although the onus lies upon an accused to establish a Charter violation on a balance of probabilities, demand for the breath samples amounts to a warrantless search which is prima facie unreasonable. The more serious or deliberate state conduct, the more likely the courts should be to disassociate from that conduct by weighing in favor of exclusion"
4_1998canlii13643.txt,"The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act. The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the adjudicator's decision following a hearing pursuant to s. 62.1 and 62.2 of The Labour Standards Act. The appellant's president did not examine his company's lease in order to determine whether the rights of access and egress were guaranteed to the appellant and its employees (which seems likely) and under which circumstances, if any, these rights could be suspended or terminated. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts, as hefound them. In addition, his findings of fact cannot be said to be 'patently unreasonable' because there was some evidence upon which he could arrive at his conclusions. The appeal based on the submission that the employer, as the appellant's employer, had an obligation to attempt to resolve a matter of work difficulties that prevented her from reporting to work. The adjudicator acted well within his jurisdiction when determining what the terms of Ms. Kovach's employment contract were and that Cajon had not fulfilled obligations thereunder. Although not all of the facts presented to him were known to the Court, his decision outlined some of the evidence uponwhich he could have arrived at his conclusion.  2)Costs were reduced to $1,500."
6_2002nsca46.txt,"The plaintiff appealed an interlocutory decision in which the chambers judge held that a non-party medical doctor who had provided emergency treatment to the plaintiff did not have to answer certain interrogatories on the basis that they required an opinion. The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial. Appeal allowed in part; the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given. Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided. However, opinions typically asked of an expert witness with respect to the medical services provided by the respondent that were not formed as part of his diagnosis and treatment of the appellant are not required to be provided. Interrogatories cannot be used to usurp the Rules surrounding the use of expert evidence.","Dr. Miller is a urologist who treated the appellant three days after he underwent a circumcision on him. The appellant commenced an action against the respondent alleging negligence in the performance of the circumcision. There is no action against Dr. Miller nor any allegation of wrongdoing by him. However, the chambers judge erred by overstating the basis upon which a non-party witness may object to answering an interrogatory calling for an opinion, when he stated that in the event the appellant serves further interrogatories or requests discovery of the appellant, the appellant will pay the appellant's reasonable hourly rate. The issue on appeal is whether the opinions sought by the interrogatories are opinions which CPR 19 requires be provided. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed in part as provided by the Chambers judge.  1) The detail required by this Rule ensures the factual basis of the expert’s opinion is clear to the trier of fact, who will have to assess the weight to give an opinion taking this into account and ensures adequate notice to the parties of experts opinions to avoid surprise and help the third party discover the truth. This rule also provides specifically for discoveries of experts and their reimbursement. To allow interrogatories to be used to usurp this function without the presence of such safeguards for the parties, the experts and the court, would not be in accordance with the orderly and fair trial practice and procedure that the Civil Procedure Rules promote.  2) It is not sufficient for the appellant to have objected to answer the balance of interrogatories by simply stating they require an opinion. Depending on the nature of the opinion, it may be necessary for him to provide it. Alternatively, he may raise a properly supported and articulated objection to answering any particular one as he may be advised, which he may do. 3) The appellant is not entitled to ask questions which call for his opinion on the standard of care, whether it was breached by the respondent and whether the appellant suffered damage as a result of the breach.  4) While recognize medical terminology may be involved, in answering these questions the appellant should attempt to use language that can be understood by the appellant. This decision does not deal with the issue of physicians who are co-defendants or non-partisans who have not subsequently treated a party to the litigation. In fact, the distinction between fact and opinion may not be clear. A doctor who is a subsequently treating physician may be required to answer interrogatories that require his opinion, even if this requires him to disclose the opinions that"
2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The appellants appealed their summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. The stated grounds of appeal were that the conviction was against the law, the evidence and the weight of the evidence; that the trial judge erred in law in holding that the appellants as Metis, within the meaning of s. 7 of the Constitution Act, 1867, did not have an Aboriginal right to hunt at night with an artificial light; and that the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity was not triggered by the legislation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate aboriginal peoples' right (s. 8 of the Regulations) and correctly identified it. The focus has shifted to the limiting legislation in both Aboriginal and Treaty hunting rights cases. 2) The trial judge did go on (pages 27 to 32) to consider infringement and justification pursuant to Sparrow. That is where the safety purpose of the legislation ought to be considered. The issue in this case is whether the regulation is a prima facie infringement of aboriginal rights and whether it is justifiable. The appellants have aboriginal hunting rights protected by the Constitution. The NRTA in 1930 altered those hunting rights, altering those rights by eliminating commercial hunting; by expanding the hunting area to include all unoccupied Crown land; and by authorizing the Province to make conservation laws. 3) The appeal is dismissed. There is no error in assessment of the facts. The facts are not in dispute.  4) It is the position of the appellant that Metis as Indians, like everyone else, are subject to the Saskatchewan regulation that prohibits night hunting with artificial lights except when hunting on Reserve. The regulation is constitutionally protected. The Crown has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws pursuant to the Wildlife Act. 5) The appellant has failed to show any error in law by applying the justification test."

2_2008nssm4.txt,"The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined. The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","The Landlord and Tenant appealed a decision of the Director allowing the Landlord the sum of $787.50 as compensation for a breach of the statutory condition to provide premises suitable for habitation. The Landlord had allowed mould to develop in her basement, which was riddled with mould. She also produced evidence of medical letters to the effect that her children suffered from asthma and ought not to be exposed to mould. The mother of two children testified that she was affected by the mould. When the mould first began to develop the Tenant called the Halifax Regional Municipality office which sent a bylaw enforcement officer to investigate. That officer recommended a dehumidifier be placed in the basement. The bylaw inspector testified that he detected mould and the conditions that allowed the mold to develop. Photographs of the mouldy conditions were placed in evidence. The condition was clearly described by the mother. She asked why if there was mould that only affected the Tenants furniture and area rug and was not obvious on the other carpeting. Appeal allowed; damages are set at $862.50. The Director was essentially correct in discounting the value of the rug and clothing. She was not credible and her explanation is not probable. On a strong balance of probabilities it was the landlord's responsibility to rectify same, and she did not. It was impossible to believe that she could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint."

HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","The survivings spouse received an income replacement benefit for herself and for her two children pursuant to the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. She took issue with the calculation of the death benefit, which was based on the percentage of her deceased husband's net income rather than on his gross income. SGI appealed the decision of the Queen's Bench as provided by the Act. HELD: The application was dismissed with interest not paid. 1)It is unnecessary to refer to s. 136(1) of the Act to calculate death benefit payable to the surviving spouse for dependent children. The method of calculating as defined by the Regulations simply clarifies that the income is based upon the actual earnings of the deceased. That may not be a correct supposition. 2)The deceased was entitled to a death benefit equal to 50% of that net income.  3)SGI was not required to calculate any other form of income that might otherwise be payable to victim, such as deemed income for students who are unable to earn an income. 4)The death benefit was not the same as 'income replacement benefit' as provided in s. 146(1). SGI was ordered to recalculate the benefit for the dependent children based on their gross yearly employment income."
8_2000skqb570.txt,"The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender of four made in response to the defendant's invitation to tender on a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The tender package contained the usual privilege clause which stated the lowest tender need not be accepted. It is an implied term of the contract that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenders fairly and will not give any an unfair advantage.  2)The plaintiff had no experience in the type of pesticide spraying. It was not known at the time that the plaintiff made arrangements to hire an experienced subcontractor. The consultant hired to advise the defendant on the technical aspects of the project used reliable independent sources for his information about the operational viability of the planes. He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.  3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment.","The defendant Government of Saskatchewan tendered a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. Four companies submitted tenders in response to the defendant's invitation to tender. The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender, which was awarded to another tenderer who had previous experience in the area and whose planes received favourable reports. The defendant complained the defendant had not treated it fairly in awarding the contract to Nielsen Ashdown and sued for damages. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to the successful party. 1)An implied term of fairness and the privilege clause are compatible and can co-exist. The person who invites tenders must treat all tenderers fairly and equally. It was based on factors relevant to the project: the amount of each tender, the experience and capabilities of tenderers and the equipment to be used on the project, in determining who should get the contract. In every case, the person who had the task of investigating the planes the tenderers proposed to use, conducted the investigation in a fair and impartial manner and in accordance with common industry practice. 2)Criminal Law – Interpretation of Civil Procedure – Enforcement of Rights The plaintiff was treated fairly, compensated for its lack of experience by making arrangements to bring on board an experienced sub-contractor (a fact Stanley did not know at the time he made his recommendation) who could have been more thorough in evaluating and investigating the tenders, but for the most part they were inexperienced in projects of this nature, and relied heavily on the advice of Gregory Curniski, a consultant who was advising the defendant."
d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. H.H. was the mother of the children. The father was apprehended by the Ministry when the children were born. Both children were the subject of a consent order for six months on October 2, 2007. Both the mother and the father were in the Ministry's care for most of their lives. The Ministry asked the order be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children.HELD: HELD: The order was granted. The children were to be returned to the father with conditions, including that he would not contact the mother, receive addiction counselling, participate in anger management and provide drug screen results, and remain drug free and provide support to the mother. 1) The evidence showed that the father had a substantial criminal record, which included 16 offences as youth. His youth offences were primarily property crimes and failures to comply with dispositions made concerning his offences. 2) The father proposed that he will continue living with the mother while the mother first attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he would address his own addiction problems. The permanency committee had explored resources with the Indian Band but the Band indicated that there were no resources on the Reserve. The mother was to attend parenting classes, continue with the methadone program and take anger management courses and provide evidence to the Ministry that she had failed to follow through with her addiction counselling courses. Although the mother was a party to the consent order, she did not appear at the hearing and her history can only be gleaned from the documents filed as exhibits and the testimony of others."
6_2014skpc40.txt,"Criminal Law – Recognizance The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","The accused is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown now applies for third recognizances. HELD: The accused is granted a security deposit.  1) The Court found that an objective person armed with the same knowledge would agree that the fears of Corporal Teniuk, the RCMP officer in charge of the High Risk Offender Response Unit, and the Parole Board of Canada documentation filed as Exhibit P-1 are reasonable. They both have the subjective and objective fear and apprehension that he will commit a serious violent or sexual offence and those fears are serious and imminent. 2) The accused provided the Court with the case of R. v. George, 2007 ONCJ 16 (CanLII) at para. 5. The accused testified that he entered the criminal system at a young age. He continued to re-offend and became entrenched there. There was no de-escalation in the violence or success in getting back on track. The sexual assaults got worse over time. The psychological/psychiatric assessment reports indicated that alcohol remains a major substance abuse risk for the accused. He breached conditions of his release and committed three assaults against his own young niece. The three escapes from lawful custody are important as there still exists differences in the documentation and how it is prepared from jurisdiction to jurisdiction across Canada, with differing authors and differing offenders in differing circumstances. The Court was unable and refuse to make generality of that sort."
c_2002skca122.txt,Appeals of sentence and conviction on the grounds the transcripts of court proceedings were not available; the court would not subpoena certain witnesses on his behalf; his state of mind when he made the telephone calls exonerated him. HELD: The appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed. The judge made no error in ruling that all of the evidence from the prospective witnesses and transcripts was irrelevant as being unrelated to the charges and too remote in time. The appellant's state of mind was adequately established by his own evidence and the summation to the jury. The defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it. The sentence appeal was moot since it was limited to time served while awaiting trial. The Court would have found the sentence to be fit in any event.,"The accused appealed his conviction and sentence. All of the members of the Court read your notice of appeal, the relevant portions of the transcript of the trial proceedings, and the Crown factum prior to hearing your arguments. They unanimously agreed that the sentence should be dismissed. The appeal against the conviction was that all of the evidence to be derived from these sources was irrelevant to the charges against you, being too remote in time, being unrelated to the charge which were subject matter of trial, and being unnecessary to establish your state of mind which was adequately established by your own evidence and your summation to the jury."
9_1996canlii6809.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff brought an action against five defendants claiming fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a skin rash were the result of silicone implants. One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning Canada Inc. (DOW). In 1990, the plaintiff received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. In 1992, she had the breast implants removed. The plaintiff presently suffers from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a persistent immune mediated skin rash. It is alleged that her condition is a result of negligence attributed to the defendants. Dow Chemical denies liability. The statement of claim does disclose wrongful conduct on the part of the defendant, the Dow Chemical Company, and there is a causal connection between that conduct and the alleged damages suffered by the plaintiff. The Court does not have jurisdiction over that defendant on the basis of the common law."

1991canlii2608.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision which overturned the respondent's convictions on charges of operating overweight vehicles contrary to s.172 of the Motor Vehicle Act. The Court had overturned the convictions on the ground that the reverse onus provision of s.172, respecting the accuracy of the scale, violated s. 11(d) of the Charter. Allowing the appeal and restoring the convictions, that the trial judge did not rely on the prima facie effect of the Crown's evidence, but rather had ample evidence concerning the accuracy of the scales upon which to rely.","The three respondents were convicted, after their trials, and fined for operating overweight vehicles on the Bedford Highway. The offence with which each was charged was a violation of the Motor Vehicle Act, then s. 172 of the Nova Scotia 1967, and now s. 192 of the Department of Transportation, and the Regulations made pursuant to the Act. The Crown appealed the convictions. Dismissing the appeals, that on the strength of the evidence, it was shown beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was operating his vehicle well above the permitted weight and tolerances on the highway. The evidence before the trial judge was that the truck of each defendant was weighed by a peace officer, who first had reason to believe each vehicle was overweight. Mobile scales authorized by the Province of the Province were used to weigh each vehicle in the manner provided by the Regulations. Each vehicle was substantially overweight. Each weighed considerably in excess of the allowable tolerance of 500 kilograms. The weights of the vehicles, how they were weighed and the procedures followed by the department of transportation in determining and maintaining the accuracy of the mobile scales were of the prima facie evidence of accuracy."

There is another defamation action, described in this judgment as the College Action. The defendant applied pursuant to Rule 41(2) that his action and the College Action be tried together because there are common issues of fact between the two, albeit different actions.  Trying them together would be in the interests of judicial economy and avoid the possibility of conflicting findings.

The defendant says the claims are different. He says this claim relates to a single issue relating to the x-ray, and does not relate to the broader issues of competence at issue in the College Action.

The couple's marriage had lasted less than four years. HELD: The QB judgment was upheld regarding the severance package. The severance package was not a reward for past service; it was for payment in lieu of reasonable notice of termination. The severance package was based on future earnings, which would have occurred within the duration of the marriage.

e_2015skqb345.txt,HELD: The court granted summary judgment for the defendants. It held that it could determine the defendants’ application prior to the plaintiffs’ application for certification. The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages. The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence. There was no genuine issue requiring a trial. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them. It was not necessary to decide the application for certification.,"The original plaintiff issued his claim under The Class Actions Act for breach of consumer protection and sale of goods legislation, breach of warranty, negligence the Competition Act and a waiver of tort.

The claim also seeks to recover damages on behalf of those who purchased the defendants' 'Low Sodium' beverages (the 'Class' or 'Class Members'), but ultimately received beverages which were no lower or not appreciably lower in sodium than other, non-Low Sodium beverages. The defendants claim that the plaintiffs made deceptive and misleading advertisement and representation by selling 'Low the Low Sodium' Beverages which the Defendants knew or should have known were no less than other low sodium beverages and that they did not suffer any damages. HELD: The application for summary judgment was granted.  1)The Court reviewed the relevant caselaw and quality of the material and found it was preferable to hear a summary judgment application prior to certification. 2)There was no genuine issue for trial. The expert evidence submitted by the Plaintiffs was uncontroverted. 3)The plaintiff did not specifically direct her mind in meaningful fashion to the claim, the Canadian statues or regulations or in short, the matters at hand. The facts are undisputed. The only reason to label and market identical products is to create the illusion that the identical products are different. Consumers collectively would expect difference in a 'low sodium' product from others in the line as being meanfully [sic] higher in sodium. The messaging is not that it is low, and so are other similar products, but that is meanfully lower. There is no foundation or basis for an expert opinion that can be put to rest any reasonable doubt as to whether or not the statements made by the plaintiffs in the statement of defence are accurate or misleading. The Court was satisfied that the defence counsel's reading of para. 16 was correct and proper admission was made (i.e. all the listed beverages were labelled low sodium) and the plaintiffs had provided no evidence that they were misled."
e_2008skpc108.txt,"The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home. They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.","The plaintiffs sued the defendant corporation for the return of a substantial amount of money. The defendant corporation was in the business of building decks and sunrooms and had been for 18 years. The plaintiff wanted to construct a glass sunroom on the back of their home and had obtained a detailed quotation from Pacific Home Products Ltd. for the construction of a concrete pad and pillar system. After the land purchase contract was entered into, and prior to construction, the defendant changed the material used in the project to concrete pilings which would be used as foundation support. The defendants sued the plaintiff for misappropriation of funds and damages. In the counterclaim, the plaintiff argued that the defendant breached its contractual obligation by failing to pay the plaintiff $2,200.00 deposit which was erroneously submitted as part of the original counterclaim. The court found that the plaintiff should bear 65% of the loss and the plaintiff, at the rate of 35% for loss, 35% to the defendant in the amount of $3,604.13. The contract between the parties was clearly frustrated by the unforseen soil conditions which prevented the drilling of ten foot depth pile holes for concrete piles. Neither party could have foreseen this issue. Both parties acted in good faith. In order to find that the contract at issue has been frustrated, a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties in a 65/35 ratio."

The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial. The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province. He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. The trial judge further commented that, had the Act been constitutional, he would have convicted because he did not accept the accused's defence of due diligence. The Crown appealed, and the accused cross-appealed. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial, that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction. It does not conflict with the federal Tobacco Act. The trial judge therefore erred in finding that the Tobacco Access Act was ultra vires. The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence. The question is not, as the trial judge thought, whether the employee who sold the tobacco was duly diligent, but whether the accused, her employer, exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent the commission of the offence, and by taking all reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system.","The appellant appealed its acquittal on a charge that it sold tobacco or a tobacco product to a person under the age of 19 years contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act. The issues at trial involved the constitutionality of the Act and the defence of due diligence. The trial judge found that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, S.C. 13, that it 'cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation', and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. Having found the legislation to be unconstitutional, an acquittal was entered. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the matter of the trial judge's finding, that he erred in finding the provincial Statute unconstitutional. The proper method of analysis in this case has three steps. First, it is necessary to determine the matter, or the 'pith and substance' of each of the federal and provincial laws. We are satisfied that the Province's tobacco access act is legislation in relation to the health of young persons. As for federal legislation, the doctrine of respondeat superior has no application. Where an employer is charged in respect of an act committed by an employee acting in the course of employment, the question will be whether the act took place without the accused's direction or approval... and whether the accused exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent commission and by taking reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system."

The police had stopped the respondent when they observed the passenger putting on a seat belt. When the respondent went to the police cruiser, the police observed signs of impairment.

Allowing the appeal and restoring the conviction. Random stops are arbitrary detentions infringing the Charters. 9 but are saved by s.1. They are authorized in Nova Scotia under Motor Vehicle Act provisions. In the course of checking licences, registration, insurance policy and mechanical condition police are justified in making observations to detect drinking drivers; the right to counsel under s. 10(b) is suspended during this period.","The respondent was convicted of driving over.08. His summary conviction appeal to the Supreme Court was allowed on the basis that he had been arbitrarily detained contrary to s. 9 of the Charter and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) was infringed. The Crown appealed on the ground that the trial judge erred respecting arbitrary detention and the exclusion of evidence of the breathalyzer test. Issues The respondent had been randomly stopped by police officer in a bar. The stop was conducted in order to check licences, insurance, and vehicle permits. It is an offence under the Motor Vehicle Act for the passenger not to have been wearing a seat belt. The police officer asked to see the appellant's driver's licence and proof of insurance. While speaking to the appellant, the officer detected alcohol on his breath and noticed that his speech was slightly slurred. The officer asked the respondent to accompany her to his police car to conduct a roadside breath test. The respondent refused and the officer told the respondent that he would be charged with failing to provide a breath sample. The trial judge concluded that although the absence of the opportunity to retain counsel may be inconsistent with s. 8, it was not necessary to reduce within specific limits the general terms in which the breath sample was administered. The use of the word 'forthwith' in the context of a roadside screening test clearly indicated that there was to be no opportunity granted to a driver to call a lawyer. The non-compliance with the breath demand by the officer was a serious breach of the rights of a free and democratic society.

The accused took no position. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. Making an order for video-conferencing for non- participating persons was not permitted because the Court had no control over the policing of the courtroom in Ontario. It would set a dangerous precedent that could result in multiple applications being made in future trials by numerous interested parties in different jurisdictions over which the Court had no control.","The applicant Government of Saskatchewan, Victim Services Branch, brought a motion before myself as trial judge for an order permitting a live audio/video broadcast from a Court of Queen's Bench courtroom in Saskatoon to a courtroom in a court house in the Greater Toronto area for the exclusive benefit of the family of the deceased. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court was presented with no case authority in which court has ever made an order allowing video conferencing for the benefit of specific non-participating persons within Saskatchewan let alone another province. This is a novel and unprecedented application. Saskatchewan has developed protocol for accommodating the participants of the trial including witnesses, lawyers and judges within the trial process by way of video conferee.

The accused had previously applied to a Provincial Court judge, who had declined the accused's application. The issue was whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused's application for judicial interim release. HELD: The jurisdiction for determination of interim judicial release of a young person charged with murder under the Youth Criminal Justice Act rests solely with the superior court of criminal jurisdiction, which is the Court of Queen's Bench in Saskatchewan.","The accused made an application under s. 515 of the Criminal Code and ss. 33 (8) and 13(2) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act for interim judicial release pending his preliminary inquiry. The Provincial Court declined the accused's application on the grounds that he's presence in the community awaiting trial would erode the public's confidence in the administration of justice. The Crown sought a determination of two preliminary issues: 1) whether the Youth Court judge in the Provincial Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the application for judicial interim release; and 2) whether this honourable court has jurisdiction to conduct review of the youth court judge's decision. HELD: The matter of jurisdiction under the old Young Offender’s Act had now been divided between the Provincial and Youth Courts. The issue then became for a young person charged with murder who is charged with second degree murder and what is the definition of a Youth Justice Court judge? The Youth Criminal justice Act provides the interim judicial release by judge only where an accused was charged with an offence referred to in s. 469 of the Code, no court, judge or justice, other than a judge presiding in a superior court of criminal jurisdiction for the province in which the accused is so charged, may release the young person from custody under that section; and 3) Homicide falls within the offences referred to under the 522 of the code."
9_2011skpc15.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused was charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window and with aggravated assault. The major issue for determination was whether the accused could be convicted of both the charge of mischief and aggravated assault or whether she should have been convicted of one of the lesser and included offences. HELD: The accused was convicted of mischief. The court found that the mens rea required for common assault is identical. All that is required is an intent to wound or maim or disfigure. The section pertains to an assault that has the consequences of wounding, maiming or disfiguring the victim. This is simply not believable. The accused is guilty of both offences. The Court of Appeal concluded that the Crown has not proved the requisite intent to sustain convictions under s. 267 or s. 268 of the Criminal Code. In this case, the accused intentionally damaged the complainant's eye area and significant bruising following the injury. The injuries could have been inflicted by a single backhanded blow."
b_2000skqb539.txt,"An application for a judicial review of a decision by the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Commission which held that the veering to the left by the two horses was within the tolerance of interference at the gate for two year olds. The Commission overturned the decision of the stewards and restored the horse declared to be in first place. In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed. The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record. The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.  3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence. The stewards were not vested with the sole authority to determine whether there was interference at the gate. 4)Knight v. Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual. 5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions. The decision of the Commission to refuse to give the applicants notice of the hearing was patently unreasonable. Their rights were affected by the decision. Bibeault was distinguishable. 6)The applicants were awarded costs.","The applicants were the owners of two horses involved in a $15,000stakes race that comprised the sixth race on that day's card and featured a field of eight horses. The horse that won the race was disqualified for interference at the gate.

HELD: The application was allowed and the decision was quashed. The matter was remitted back to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices were given to the applicants. 1)It is presumed in each case that procedural fairness applies and it will take an explicit or clearly implicit provision to the contrary in the legislation or the contract between the public authority and the individual. A miscarriage of justice has occurred. Here the employees were represented by an employees' association and therefore it would not be necessary for the employees to be separately represented. Furthermore, the decision of the commission to refuse to give the applicants notice of the hearing was patently unreasonable. 2)Although opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions form no part of the record and therefore cannot be considered by the court on judicial review, the Commission has an obligation to protect the rights of the applicants to ensure they have right to be heard."

He also made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The learned judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1) of the Code. The sentence imposed did not properly reflect the principle of deterrence or the gravity of the offence. 2) This was a serious fraud accomplished by what the judge called a rather intricate kiting system.","The accused was convicted, after trial, of fraud exceeding five thousand dollars. He wrote a cheque for $11,000 on his personal bank account knowing that the account lacked sufficient funds.

e_1991canlii2551.txt,"The issue in this appeal was whether a landlord can give notice of a rental increase at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease. Section of the lease provides for increases upon months notice to the tenant. The trial judge found that notice must be given months prior to the expiration of the lease. For the appellant, that notice of a rental increase may be given at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease.","The tenants entered a standard form lease in 1989. By virtue of its terms, the lease was automatically renewed for a further term of one year from March 1, 1990 provided that neither party gave notice of termination three months prior to the termination date. This was a three percent guideline increase on the base rent which was accepted by the respondents. The appellant offered to permit the respondents to terminate the release on three months notice if they were unhappy with the rental increase. The respondents chose not to exercise this option. The issue was whether the landlord had the right under either the Residential Tenancies Act or the Rent Review Act to unilaterally demand an increase in rent during the term of the lease. The facts were not in dispute. The only restriction in s. 11 of the Act was that the notice of rent increase must come three months before the expiration or possible renewal of the tenancy. The three-month notice requirement was not interpreted as granting the landlord the right to increase the rent in the middle of the term. The Act is intended to protect the tenant from being coerced into giving up his contractual rights. The court allowed the appeal and set aside the decision and recommendation of the Board."

The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had. HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed. 1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted. He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest. The plaintiff was entitled to interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act on the claim for extras to the contract. 4)The claim for the extras was never in dispute. The defendants were entitled to costs of the action.,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant whereby the plaintiff was to build and supply a ready to move home (""RTM"") placed on basement.

The defendant's evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% wasinserted into the document and the nature of the evidence must be clear and convincing. The Court cannot accept the plaintiff'sversion of events.  1) The plaintiff was aware that an RTM does not come with a basement and that there was a common intention or agreement as to the terms of the agreement. 2) The defendant knew that the plaintiff wanted a price for the RTM and basement. There was no agreement between the parties to pay interest. 3) When further details of the purchase price were inserted into paragraph 4(d) and (e) at a later date and initialed by Mrs. Batiuk, no interest was called for as there was no indication that the price would not be paid in full.  4) With respect to costs, while the plaintiff has obtained judgment for the extras, this was never in dispute and was admitted by the defendants in their statement of defence.

HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired. The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients. 3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice. 4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants. The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods. 5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","Interlocutory injunctions are an extraordinary remedy and thus it is incumbent upon the applicant to demonstrate a prima facie case or even a serious issue to be tried that it was in law entitled to more than two weeks notice or that the respondents were in breach of any right which accrued to Danka. HELD: The application was granted with costs to the respondents in the amount of $10,000. The injunctive relief sought was granted on a quia timet basis and to enforce what the applicant says are restrictive covenants, obligations of confidentiality and fiduciary duty binding on the respondents. Relief quia t requires the applicant demonstrate a strong prima Facie case of imminent danger of substantial damage. Danka accepted the resignations without protest or comment. The submission by Danka that despite its ejection of the employees from its premises they remained employees is neither borne out by the time constraints placed on applicants seeking such relief and with the factual nature of the circumstances.  1) The injunctions as a whole seek to enforce certain restrictive covenant, restrain employees from competitive activity pending the expiration of reasonable notice periods and generally restrain all respondents from any direct or indirect dealings with customers of Danka Canada Inc. (Danka Canada). 2) There is an important public interest in discouraging restraints on trade, and maintaining free and open competition unencumbered by the fetters of restrictive covens. The fact that Danka has failed to demonstrate that its right to relief from the wrongs committed or threatened by the respondent is clear requires the application to succeed at trial. The existence of this directive will not prevent Brennan Office Plus from advertising your availability to the market or making known that you have joined the Danka team. If a business is attracted from your former Danka customers, you will be free to accept such business. The burden of proof that the inconvenience which Danka will suffer by the refusal of the injunction is greater that which the defendants will suffer lies on Danka Inc.  3) Injunctive relief until trial is necessary to protect Danka against irreparable damage and loss, mere inconvenience not being enough. 4) The affidavits of the respondent employees taken as whole lead to the conclusion there has been no activity which could constitute the breaches referred to by the applicant in its memorandum. In the absence of the factual foundation to provide credence for Danka's irrational fear that wrongs will be done extraordinary relief by way of injunction will not be granted.  5) The application for an injunction restraining the respondent from soliciting or"

The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court applied for an extension of the 30 day time period provided by s. 67 of The Legal Profession Act for an assessment of all bills for legal services that Brabant and Company Law Office rendered to the applicant within six years of the date of the application. The applicant’s request was not based on a complaint as there was nothing in the evidence that indicated there was a prima facie overvaluing or undervaluing of the services provided prior to January 2013. The general complaint from the applicant centered around their belief in an overall amount of billings over a lengthy period, this application covering 2009 2015, with specific attention being given to 2011 2013. It was not in the interests of justice to extend the time beyond the 30 days for the assessment."

Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.","The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. The complainant testified that she was home every Friday night with the appellant. She also claimed that he touched her breasts and inside her pants on numerous occasions. The Crown called a counsellor as witness. The Court found that the complainant's testimony was consistent throughout and had been given in a reasonable manner 'worthy of belief'. Two medical doctors testified that the sexual acts took place primarily at her home, usually on Friday nights when her mother was working and her sister had gone to visit her brother and his girlfriend. Over the time period covered by the information, it appears that it was close to being so. The appellant appealed.

Crown counsel acknowledged that this type of case would generally attract a suspended sentence with probation but for negative information in the pre-sentence report, which the appellant had not seen prior to sentencing. The appellant argued that he had seen the errors of his ways, was seeking employment, was truly remorseful, and had apologized to his grandparents, who were paying for the appeal in the hope of keeping him out of jail.

Dismissing the appeal, that the sentence was clearly unreasonable. The appellant had not done his homework, had not consumed alcohol or drugs while residing with him, and had not had any behaviour or personality changes that would indicate use without a prior criminal record. The affidavit from the father was lacking in probative value and the defendant's stated belief that his son had not abused drugs or alcohol while living with him was of marginal value given his history of daily use."

The following clause appeared in the agreement:If the parties cohabited for more than 90 days with reconciliation as the primary purpose of the cohabitation, the provisions contained in the Agreement will become void. HELD: Counsel proceeded on the basis that the instrument was separation agreement. The Court found the respondent evasive, argumentative andultimately untruthful in his answers to a number of questions.  1) The circumstances surrounding the signing of the so-called separation agreement and the reason he gave forit; (2) The untrue statements he set out in his divorce petition in Ontario as toidency, statements that he sworeas true in his subsequent application for divorce judgment; (3) His action in applying for a defaultjudgment in the divorce proceedings when he knew the petitioner hadserved his solicitor with her Answer; (4) The parties clearly intended to re-establish their life together. The respondent emphasized number of times that his desire was to see the family fully restored and together and that the employment he obtained at Melville, Saskatchewan finally permitted the family to be together in this province.  5) Each of the parties testified and they were the only persons called at the trial of the issue of cohabitations. There was no serious argument that they cohabitated in 1997. The only issue was for how long. The petitioner swore that the relationship lasted for ten days in May 1997 and from June 28 1997 until June 30 1997 and then from June 30, 1997 until September 18. If the petitioner's account is accepted, the relationship would have extended for a period of at least 95 days."
9_1999canlii12597.txt,"The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action. The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act (Family Maintenance Act) which:a) restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the petitioner in relation to the respondent's claim in Queen's Bench Action No.2270/97 (the 'Action'), pending the petitioner's application or further court order; and(b) restrorains the respondent from disposing of any of the monies that he has received or may receive in connection to the Action; and, in the balance of convenience, from the risk of injury to the plaintiff if the injunction is not granted, versus the probability of harm to the defendant if it is granted.HELD: The respondent's personal claim for damages in the Action is the only asset that might give him an ability to satisfy the claim under the Act that has been made by the petitioner on behalf of herself and the children. Likewise, there is no persuasive evidence that upon success in his Action the respondent would voluntarily ensure that any claim is satisfied. The court accepts that if the entire proceeds from the Action were disposed of, the petitioner’s claim would be impaired or defeated because the petitioner had not met the tests that must be considered in an application for an interlocutory injunction. However, if the proceeds from such an action are disposed of it would be unlikely that the full amount would be required to satisfy such a claim. No evidence was presented regarding the potential value of the $40,000."
2_2004nssf92.txt,"The husband applied to have the wife's application for retroactive child support to cover the costs of the child's post-secondary education struck as a matter more properly addressed as an issue of contract. In addition to the child support ordered in the Corollary Relief Judgment, the husband had signed a document in which he agreed to repay the costs of the daughter's American student loans (which had to be obtained in the wife's name as the wife was an American). The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation. Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'. There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties.","The wife brought an application pursuant to Rule 14.25 to strike out the husband's application for a retroactive child support order. The wife sought declaratory relief, exemplary or punitive damages and costs. The husband opposed the application on the basis that it was an effort to enforce the corollary relief judgment and amendment, or in the alternative, to retroactively vary the child support provisions. The father had filed a defence and added the wife as a third party. HELD: The application was struck out. The court found that the husband had complied with his child support obligation as set out in the Corollary Relief judgment and there was nothing to enforce. The only change in circumstances since the application was that the wife was unable to rely on as a promise made to her in the event that she was called on to pay the balance of the Federal Plus loans. It was also found that neither the wife nor the father treated these obligations as child support. The applicant did not take the deduction as contemplated in their agreement and there is no evidence Ms. Mabey declared it as income.  1)It is well established that variation, either retroactively or prospectively, requires material change in circumstance. In effect, something must have occurred that was not in the parties knowledge or contemplation at the time of the last order. An order to strike all or part of a pleading is to be exercised with great care and caution and only in the most exceptional and clear circumstances. If this matter is not known at the relevant time it cannot be relied on as the basis for variation. It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action. The application is frivolous and it is unnecessary to delay the inevitable trial. 2)The husband was responsible for all of the children's post-secondary education. He was also responsible for the mortgage payments for the oldest child, who attended Boston College from 1995 to 1999.  3)The applicant was entitled to costs."
6_2015skqb138.txt,"Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","FIAT: One of the Szwagierczak's five daughters seeks an order directing a trial to prove the 2013 Will in solemn form. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The test in Quaintance is based exclusively on an alleged absence of testamentary capacity. The Court was satisfied that the applicant has not made out a genuine issue for trial yet. Accordingly, the application must be dismissed.  2) In the circumstances, the test is reasonably low. The respondent did not have the capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. There is nothing mysterious about the role of suspicious circumstances in this respect. The presumption simply casts an evidentiary burden on those attacking the will. This burden can be satisfied by adducing or pointing to the evidence."
2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of mandamus to compel the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was disabled and had been recipient of income assistance from the Department of Community Services since 2006. His assistance was terminated in May 2006 due to failure to disclose requested information. He re-applied for income assistance in May 2007. His application was again denied on the failure to provide requested information, this time on the basis that he met the criteria set out in the definition of eligibility. The Board ordered that his assistance be effective the date that he was assessed. The application was granted. The court found that there was a clear legal right established to have the decision of the Appeal Board enforced. There must be a duty to the applicant by the parties seeking to be coerced to do the act requested and a duty owed must not be of one of a discretionary nature but may be established either at common law or statute."

The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial. The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access. The applicant had been prohibited in a 1998 order from removing the children from Saskatchewan without a court order, absent consent.HELD: 1)The issue of the payments was directed to trial and pre-trial conference to be held in January. 2)The mother was granted leave to move the children to Alberta.

Additional access was granted provided he picked up and returned the children to the applicant's residence. 3)The 1998 interim order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home was not changed. The applicant was at liberty to rent the home. 4)The applicant was directed to take all reasonable steps to sell the recreational trailer in her possession and to pay the sale proceeds to the bank to discharge the lien and the balance into court.

2008skqb33.txt,"The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules striking paragraphs of the amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the statement of claim to remain would be an abuse of process. The paragraphs of the amended statement of claim at issue deal with the fact that the plaintiff alleges he was assaulted by the defendant and sustained bodily harm. The defendant was charged with assault, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. The issue is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceedings on the subsequent civil proceedings. HELD: The paragraphs of the statement of claim at issue do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial is inadmissible in a subsequent civil trial as proof that the party did not commit the offence.  2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the Crown against the defendant, the Crown bore the onus throughout to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence did not apply and the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings.

d_1991canlii4322.txt,"A complaint was lodged against the applicant police officer that she had been discourteous to the victim of a sexual assault and that she had lied about being granted permission to attend a meeting held to investigate the assault. The applicant was given written notice of the substance of both allegations according to the disciplinary procedure set out in the regulations made pursuant to the Police Act, but in the space provided for the citation the notice cited only the regulation which dealt with the offense of being discourteous. A hearing before an inspector of the Police Department resulted in the applicant being found guilty of the offense of lying. She initiated a review by the Police Review Board which concluded that the section reference in the charge did not have to be accurate. The applicant brought this proceeding for judicial review and submitted that the Board's jurisdiction was limited by the citation of a particular regulation and to finding her guilty of the behaviour described in the regulation cited. Dismissing the application, that the failure to cite what the Board considered the proper offense in no way materially affected the procedural fairness of the hearings or limited the Board's jurisdiction. The applicant had complete notice of the nature of the allegations against her and was represented by counsel at the Board hearing.

After two years, the relationship between the Respondents and the Mother broke down and she left their home. The Respondents sought and were granted custody of the child. The Mother appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Respondents had sufficient interest under s.6 of The Children's Law Act to seek custody of the child. 2)The trial judge correctly determined that the only issue was the child's best interests, even in a contest between a parent and a stranger, although the parent/child relationship was one factor to be considered. 3)The findings of the trial judge were strongly supported by the evidence, the law was correctly applied, and therefore his decision ought not be overturned. 4)The matter was returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access.","The appellant, who is mentally handicapped, appeals the entrusting of custody of her five year old son to the respondents.

The relationship between the parties broke down and she left the care of the respondents on May 30, 1992. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with costs here and below and the matter returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access by the mother. 1)The trial judge erred in ruling the respondents had sufficient interest within the meaning of s.6 of the Children's Law Act and therefore status to apply for custody. The trial judge misconstrued important evidence and misinterpreted important facts. This rule prevails even in contests between a natural parent and a stranger. The parental tie between mother and child is, of course, not to be ignored in such a contest. It is taken into account by the judge when considering the factors outlined in s.8 of the Act. 2)The court's role is not to determine broad social issues, but instead to determine what custodial arrangement is in the child\'s best interest. These principles apply to this contest. This case was different in that the trial judge made no order as to costs, the respondents' cross-appeal for costs and the costs on double Column on appeal."
4_2009skqb403.txt,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","The applicant is 39 years old licensed practical nurse who is employed with the Mamawetan Health Region.

The applicant commenced a petition in October 2008 in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, The Children's Law Act, 1997, and Family Maintenance Act. HELD: The application for interim relief is dismissed. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the applicant is the appropriate interim amount that ought to be paid and should relieve her from some of the economic hardship that she has been experiencing as a result of the breakdown of the spousal relationship.  1) The fact that one is not the biological parent of child does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide financial support for that child. However, it is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the applicant or the respondent, such as denial by the applicant of access to the child. 2) Given the short-term relationship and to add impetus to having the issues resolved sooner rather than later, the Court ordered these payments be paid for a total of eight months. 3) Should this court order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favor of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000?"
b_2000skqb106.txt,"SGI paid $47,427, the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, to the guardian of the three infant children of the deceased single mother. The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident. Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854. The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs. Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5). It is the total amount payable as a death benefit. The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero. Where no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s.146(3), no further amount is payable under either s.146(5) or s.147(5).","The sole issue before the court was whether any additional dependant child care benefits were payable under s. 146(5) of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act when the deceased victim was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The children were not entitled to any additional benefits under the act. The only dependant benefit payable under the Act was the minimum death benefit, which was payable until the date that the surviving spouse died. The deceased was not employed and would not have become entitled to an income within six months if she had survived the accident. As there was no surviving spouse the children were entitled to death benefits. The appeal was dismissed without any order as to costs.S. 147 of the Act does not assist in determining the death benefit. It merely provides that where there are no surviving spouses or where the deceased was, as is the case here, sole parent, and there is more than one dependent child the deceased child death benefit under s146(1) is payable for the youngest child and the remaining children are entitled to the additional benefit."
2_2004skqb498.txt,"FIAT: By fiat of December 5, 2002, Gerein C.J. authorized the initiation of a derivative action by Dale Henry (Henry) on behalf of 609897 Saskatchewan Ltd. (609). By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action. In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs. Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609.","FIAT. By fiat of May 27, 2004 the defendants in the action were entitled to examine a representative of 609 for discovery and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for the plaintiff. In September 2004 clarification was requested and, with the consent of the plaintiff, Ms. Ouellette for the defendants and Mr. Agnew for the board of directors, the matter proceeded by conference call and written submissions. HELD: 1) It is the plaintiff and the defendants who have status in these proceedings and not Henry in his personal capacity nor the directors of the company in this case. 2) It follows that the person instructing the company's counsel is exercising the same legal authority as the defendant and is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. The nature of the action is such that Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of the 609's counsel. He was appointed for that purpose and is obligated to so instruct 609’s counsel. The issue of cost of production of documents for the statement as to documents is presently to be resolved in the same manner as set out in the fiat. 3) Questions 4 and 5, and the first branch of question are self-evident once one accepts the unity of interest between Henry and 609 which is necessarily reflected in the decision authorizing the action. It follows then that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to the company. As a corporation, a corporation may only litigate with legal representation, Henry is empowered and obliged to appointed counsel for 609. Whether that counsel is Mr. Brehon, another member of his firm or someone from outside that firm is entirely matter for Henry. Such counsel is entitled to access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the application, including preparation of a statement of to documents and following the modified discovery process set out by the Chief Justice. These concerns still pertain and consequently, without prejudice to the application for cost reimbursement, the costs in first instance remain with Henry."
d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Criminal Code) relating to the issuance of a search warrant on May 3, 2005. The search warrant alleged that the accountant filed fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund, and misreported HST sales. An earlier Information, sworn in April 2005, had been referred to as a prior search warrant. The applicant claimed the information contained incomplete and misleading information and that the learned Justice of the Peace erred in concluding that the necessary grounds existed for the search. In light of his clear statement on cross-examination, the applicant said he would not have pursued a warrant without the information provided by the informant. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1) The informant did not say that he would have sought the warrant in the absence of the defective paragraphs but only that he was more comfortable omitting information that he now knows to be erroneous.  2) The nature of the breach of the rules of natural justice is not difficult to understand. Judicially interpreted, the standard is one of credibly based probability. Mere suspicion, conjecture, hypothesis or 'fishing expeditions' fall short of the minimally acceptable standard from both common law and constitutional perspective. Once the allegation of misleading and inaccurate HST reporting is removed, the substance of the Information rests upon the handwritten T4 submitted by the applicant that did not appear to be reconciled with the company payroll. Without denying the potential seriousness of these allegations, they rise above the level of'suspicion' to make out reasonable and probable grounds for a warrant to search the applicant's (and his wife's) home."

While the claim discloses a possible cause of action based on the Attorney General's statutory undertakings, this alone doesn't decide the matter. The amendments add nothing by way of necessary detail to the claim, which doesn't plead sufficient material facts to comply with the Rules on pleadings (see Rule 4.02).","The defendant AGC moved for summary judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that the plaintiff's amended statement of claim did not disclose a reasonable cause of action and was clearly unsustainable when read on its own. The AGC also brought a motion for dismissal of the proceeding on the basis that it was brought by way of an attack on the validity of the statutory undertakings given by the AGC in 1996. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff.  1) There is no evidence that the undertaking gives rise to a claim other than by attack as a result of the making or execution of the special warrant or restraint order. While this is a significant factor, it does not necessarily defend against this summary judgment application based on the amended statements of claim. The amendments do not add nothing to the Statement of Claim that was before Justice LeBlanc.  2) It is well settled that the test pursuant to Rule 14.25(1)(a) is that the application will not be granted unless the action is “obviously unsustainable”. It is not the court's function to try the issues but rather to decide if there are issues to be tried. In considering an application to strike a pleading, it is the court’s function and responsibility to try and determine if there is a duty of care to the family owed by the defendants, there is no legal justification for a protracted and expensive trial. 3) The plaintiff cannot avoid the rules concerning pleadings."

The Supreme Court upheld the decision. The appellants appealed.

The sentencing judge ordered full restitution. The appellants appealed; the Crown conceded that the appeal should be allowed.

On January 2005, the Board's appeals committee upheld a 2004 decision of the Board's case management division that the applicant was fit for employment. Although the applicant has another avenue of appeal available to him within the workers' compensation system, he takes the position that the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction, so that there is no proper decision from which to appeal, leaving him with an application for judicial review as his only remedy. HELD: Whether or not the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction and consequently are a nullity, the applicant has an adequate alternative remedy available to him. No special circumstances that might justify judicial intervention at this time have been presented. An order in the nature of certiorari is not available to him because he has not yet pursued his right of appeal. The application is dismissed.","FIAT: The applicant applies for an order in the nature of certiorari quashing or setting aside the decisions of the Board's case management division and appeals committee. HELD: The application is dismissed. The parties may speak to costs. 1) The impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction so that there was no proper decision from which to appeal, leaving the applicant with an adequate alternative remedy.  2) The legislature has chosen to establish the workers' compensation system as an self-contained system, with no right of appeal to the courts beyond the final decision of the Appeals Committee. The legislature regarded this as sufficient in matters of workers’ compensation, likely because of the extensive system that it established in the Act.

4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (PCS) for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine at Rocanville, Saskatchewan. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $500. The defendant is entitled to costs against the plaintiff and the plaintiff is to pay costs against Sullivan. 1) The law is well settled that an employee is under an implied obligation not to compete with an employer during the term of his or her employment. Although the defendant had given notice that he would no longer work for the plaintiff after September 30th, he was still employed at the time he submitted his proposal. The claim against PCS is dismissed. 2) The trial judge erred in fact in characterizing the plaintiff's actions as mere preparation. The plaintiff competed with her employer for business which had been the employer's. Her placing of the bid went beyond preparation. 3) The Court is unable to distinguish the actions of the defendant in Restauronics Services Ltd. v. Forster (2004 BCCA 130) with respect to breach of the duty of fidelity to the plaintiff.  4) In the case at bar the appellant proved that the respondent breached her duty of loyalty by competing with the plaintiff for the BCCW contract while she was in its employ. It did not prove that the defendant used any confidential information or trade secrets in preparing the bid. In fact, it seems to be impossible to lay down any fixed test applicable to all circumstances. The only issue on appeal is whether the plaintiff breached her employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS. The Court of Appeal has held that merely planning to establish competing business does not ipso facto violate the duty, unless it is clear that the employee has already determined to abuse the employer’s confidential information, trade secrets, or entice fellow employees of the employer to join him or her in the new business. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife when he was off work."
8_2011skca35.txt,"The applicants applied for leave to appeal from a Chambers decision denying their application to dismiss the respondent's claim against them for want of prosecution. The applicants were partners in an architecture firm that provided design drawing and specifications for the construction of the Education Building at the University of Saskatchewan. The building was substantially completed in 1970. In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building. In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss. In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief. In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer. The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997. Between 1997 and 2010, documents were exchanged, discoveries were held and an unsuccessful settlement negotiation was held. In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution. The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant. Secondly, the issue of delays in litigation is important and the case will present an opportunity for the Court to clarify the legal framework pertaining to such matters.","The applicants are defendants in an action commenced by the respondent University of Saskatchewan. They applied to have the University's claim against them dismissed for want of prosecution but were unsuccessful. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted. The court found that the delay from 1991 to 1998 (when the university's insurer was prosecuting the action) was not problematic. However, the reason for the delay was because the university had not obtained an appointment for the examination for discovery until 1997. As result, the university did not assume control of the action in issue here until 1998. The issue of merits was found to be well known and there was enough merit in their position to warrant granting leave."
c_2013skpc37.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08. The accused was permitted to use his cell phone on the way to the RCMP detachment to call his wife in Calgary and request help in finding a lawyer. He did not receive a call back from his wife. The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available. The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid. After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.' The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value. The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call. The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape. The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio. The video was taped over every 60 days and had been destroyed before it was requested by defence counsel. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. Even though the accused's cell phone was taken from him before he received a call back from his wife, it is clear that the accused made a conscious decision to call Legal Aid, and by implication, did not wish to pursue the first course of action. There was no obligation on the part of the RCMP to provide the accused with a Prosper warning. The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult with another lawyer. The officer was justified in assuming that the accused was satisfied with the legal advice he had received. The Crown stayed the impaired driving count prior to the conclusion of the trial. The videotape evidence was not relevant to the .08 offence because all observations were made at roadside. The video would not have shown anything of relevance to the charge. There is no breach of the accused's rights under s. 7. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted into evidence and the accused was convicted of the .08 charge.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood; and having been stopped by an RCMP officer shortly after driving away from a bar/restaurant in Oxbow, Saskatchewan, was impaired by alcohol. The accused blew a screening device and was taken to the detachment where samples of breath were obtained with readings of 130 mgs and 120 mgs. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)The accused's rights to counsel were breached. 2)The destruction of video evidence breached the accused's right to make full answer and defence. 3)Since the accused had been allowed to call his wife from his cell phone in the police cruiser on the way to Carlyle, the investigating officers should have waited a reasonable time for his wife to call him back. This would only become an issue once the Court determines that the destroyed evidence was relevant. There must be a reasonable possibility that the information could be useful to the accused in making full answer & defence."

Based upon the opinion of her doctor, the court found partial disability of 3 months, and that her symptoms were fully resolved within 1 year. The court awarded general damages of $18,000.00.

Liability was not in issue. The plaintiff was found to have a whiplash injury which, according to medical evidence, substantially resolved over a period of about one year following the accident. Trial Judge applied for a non-pecuniary damage award. HELD: The proper level at the time of the accident was $18,000. 1)No weight was given to the doctor who was the only expert who was familiar with her pre-accident state than to the physical therapist who was unable to quantify that part of her disability. 2)The plaintiff did not exercise well for 3 months after the accident and continued to complain of neck stiffness and back pain. 3)She was concerned about her diabetes, osteoporosis and hypertension. Dr. Gorania, her doctor of many years standing, treated the plaintiff and she was concerned only with her diabetes. His report in June 1988 indicated a nolikelihood of permanent disability and showed partial disability of only 3 months. 4)The physical therapist was not called to testify. The court was not satisfied by the evidence tendered in respect of her loss of housekeeping capacity as it would appear she was substantially disabled prior to the injury. 5)Costs were not allowed as they did not appear to have been incurred for any reason reasonably attributable to the cause.  6)Pre-judgment interest was not applied to the award of damages."

The respondent seeks an order that his child support obligations for their child ended July 2004 because their child ceased to be a person within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act as he was not, by reason of the pursuit of reasonable education, unable to withdraw from his mother's charge. HELD: 1) The child completed grade 12 in 2004 having turned 18 in February. He returned to high school in the fall of 2004. He worked at McDonald's during that year and lived with his mother. Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media. He is still under his mother's charge. She provides him with room and board. He is only 19 years old.

This will continue until March 2006 when he has completed his current course of study. 2) The respondent's income fluctuates. It is appropriate to take an average of the last 3 years to determine his income.  3) Some attention must be paid to the financial ability of each parent to contribute. After deducting the table amount, the respondent would have a gross annual income of $19,781.52. On that basis the court was not prepared, even in the face of some shortfall for the child, to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts. The guideline amount is the appropriate amount to be paid until the end of this year's study.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the respondent was a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997 and that he had had that status on a continuing basis to the present time. The respondent had a gross annual income of $19,781.52. It was not appropriate to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts but the respondent had an obligation to provide support as well as to the respondent's pro-rata share and to be reimbursed for any payments made subsequent to that date. On the basis of the respondent’s income, the amount of child support was reduced from $200 per month to $181 per month."

He died of drowning due to inexperienced scuba diving. Defendant not guilty of the offence charged; the defendant was not the deceased's employer. All four individuals thought of themselves as self-employed fishermen and had a profit-sharing agreement; the evidence did not establish that the defendant was acting as skipper or captain in the owner's absence; the defendant was not operating the vessel and the evidence did not show that the defendant had any kind of authority over the other fishers. The deceased was dependant on the boat's owner for the boat and part of the gear, for another individual for the licence and on the defendant for the balance of the gear; the relationship was closer to that of independent contractor than that of employer-employee.","The defendant was charged under s.13(1)(a) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act with failing to take reasonable precautions to ensure the health and safety of persons at a workplace. The deceased was a self-employed fisherman who, despite having never done so before, was required to perform duties mainly for the defendant and was in a relationship with him that more closely resembled an employee relationship than that of an independent contractor. The defendants were recruited by the defendant to fish with him and the defendant. HELD: The defendant was not guilty of the offence charged. If the legislature means to include fishers as employers or employees under this Act, it should do so specifically and inform the industry in advance of that change in policy. The cases to which the Crown referred me by way of analogy were all decided in the context of labour relations, not worker safety and none of them involved fishers. do not find them persuasive. The definition of 'dependent contractor' in s.3(j) applied and under that law it must be held that the fishermen were engaged in a joint venture with the owners of the vessels, species of partnership, and that there was no employer-employee relationship.

HELD: The petitioner was given judgment for $51,725.82 with taxable costs of the action payable within 3 months, failing which, the petitioner may apply for directions as to sale of the family property. The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm. The petitioner's claim for $1,000, borrowed from a friend to pay legal fees, was not considered a matrimonial debt.","The petitioner sought a distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. The parties lived on an acreage and rented farm land. They carried on a mixed farming operation. The respondent did the farm work with the petitioner providing assistance. An appraisal of the farm land and out buildings was done and the report filed. Absent any evidence to the contrary, the respondent's testimony was accepted. HELD: 1) The farm machinery comprises major portion of the family property. Over the years the respondent has owned several machines and this began before the marriage. The petitioner has received no benefit from these expenses. For example, she received no income from the farm since the separation. Therefore, she should bear no responsibility for the payments made. 2) The debts submitted by the respondent which believe should be taken into account are those of $856.00 plus $1,000 for money she borrowed from a friend to make a payment on account of legal fees. 3) The respondent sold his trailer and the sale proceeds of $12,000 were used to purchase the acreage. There is a serious dispute in respect to what pieces of machinery constitute family property; what exemptions are available to the respondent; and what value should be attributed to the equipment which is subject to distribution. These debts were referred to three appraisals; one done at the behest of the petitioner and two at the respondent, with the sole purpose of fixing the value of the machinery at $800. 4) The petitioner was awarded judgment against the respondent in the sum of $51,725.82 together with taxable costs of the action."

There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support. If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced. The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support.","The appellant applies for an order staying execution of a spousal support order that provided ongoing support for the appellant's wife, the respondent in the amount of $10,000 per month; gave the respondent exclusive possession of the family home; provided for shared parenting of their son and awarded child support of $2,726 per month. The appellant argues that the Chambers judge's conclusion that he stopped paying the bills at the end of October 2015 and that that in fact was not the case. HELD: The application to lift the stay of proceeding is allowed. It is understood that the stay is to minimize prejudice pending the appeal and to balance the competing interests of the respondent who has been successful against those of an appellant who ought not to be prejudiced simply by appealing. The principles pertaining to applications to lift a stay are well-settled. In making decisions with respect to such applications, the Courts objective is to prevent injustice and to ensure the results are as fair and equitable as possible. In this case, the appellant application was allowed."
7_1990canlii4117.txt,"Where the petitioner demonstrated that she did not upgrade her education during the marriage as a result of her attempts to become pregnant and thus there was a causal connection between the petitioner's need and the marriage, interim maintenance in the amount of $100 per month was ordered ,  having regard to the means, needs and circumstances of each spouse.","The parties were married fifteen years. There were no children. The petitioner wished to upgrade herself so she could obtain a degree in Accounting.

She resided with relatives. She now sought maintenance on an interim basis. The respondent denied this application. Allowing the application and awarding the sum of $100 to the petitioner, that while this may not be the basis for a lump sum or monthly maintenance being made at the time the divorce is heard, it was appropriate to award the sum.

8_2002skqb144.txt,"FIAT. After a decree nisi of foreclosure had issued but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners (the former husband) applied for judicial sale of the matrimonial home. The joint owners separated in 1999 and are involved in an acrimonious family law court action. The wife has exclusive possession of the property. The Credit Union as first mortgagee opposed the application. The co-owner did not participate. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)This is not the proper forum to attempt to affect a family property settlement. The husband was not entitled in these proceedings to a possession order. The wife prevented every attempt to show the property to prospective owners. There was no reason to assume she will be any more cooperative with a court appointed realtor. The Credit Union did not request immediate possession. 2)The court's entitlement to order a judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. The court reviewed the history of the statutory authority for a judicial sale in a mortgage foreclosure proceedings. The 1852 Chancery Procedure Amendment Act was repealed in 1881 and replaced by Ordinance 51, Rule 1, which became law in the NWT by virtue of the Judicature Ordinance No.6 of 1893. It is now found in s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act in its modified form. Deciding whether it is 'necessary or expedient' within the meaning of s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act is, however, a judicial exercise.","After a decree nisi of foreclosure issued, but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners applied for judicial sale of the mortgaged property, being the matrimonial home.

The mortgagee, Border Credit Union, opposed the application and the co-owner, Sandra Klarenbach, did not participate in the hearing. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)Border Credit Union was entitled to apply for a final order of foreclosure. Any further delay that does not result in sale and payment of the mortgage in full will result in lost security value for the Credit Union. 2)The registered owners had had ample opportunity since their separation to resolve their family property dispute.

HELD: The application was granted. There was a prima facie case of the violation by the defendants of a right or rights that the applicant might have. The applicant has shown more than the mere prospect orapprehension of injury that the defendants would suffer for enacting that which the applicant alleges is in violation of its rights. The plaintiff is suffering in consequencethereof and that such suffering cannot be adequatelycompensated for by the award of damages in money.

2_2007skca63.txt,"The respondent was convicted of having in his possession a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and was sentenced to a term of incarceration of 9 months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent, resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and was sentenced to a term of incarceration of 9 months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The offence took place in Yorkton. The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck, which was owned by the respondent and paid for through a loan from his parents. The trial judge found that 'basically all of the money' to pay for the truck came from the parents' bank account but they had registered no lien to protect their interests. The father was depressed and remorseful. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part. The truck was ordered forfeited. 1) The onus is on the sentencing judge to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the Act. 2) The impact of an order of forfeiture may have on any member of the immediate family of the person charged with or convicted of the offence, if the dwelling house was the member's principal residence at the time the charge was laid and continues to be the member’s principal residence, and if the member is innocent of any complicity in the offence or of any collusion in relation to the offence (s. 19.1(4)). 3) There is no reference to proportionality in regard to personal property and it is only in regard, with respect to forfeiture of real property, that the judge can take into account the impact of a forfeiture and whether it is proportionate to the nature and gravity of the offences, the circumstances surrounding the commission of a designated substance offence, and the criminal record. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person."
2_2008nsca28.txt,"The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) adopted policy 1.3.6 of the Government Employees Compensation Act (GECA) which provides for gradual onset stress claims under the GECA. The appellant argued that WCAT erred in finding that there were 'unusual and excessive' workplace stressors in the workplace, which could not be considered in an objective manner. WCAT also failed to give weight to the opinion of the appellant's treating psychologist in the absence of any evidence to rebut that opinion. The appeal turned on two main issues. The first was whether the policy was wrong to take this approach and if not, whether WCAT applied it unreasonably to the worker's situation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The policy was based on the best available evidence. There was no inconsistency with the standard by which the court should review these questions. The decision of the Court in Bishop v. Nova Scotia briefly reviewed the state of the law at the Tribunal level. Beyond this threshold question, there was uncertainty about whether the employee must be'caused personal injury by an accident' (s. 4(1)(a)(i)) and how it applied it. 2) The Court reviewed the record according to the reasonableness standard. 3) WCAT did not err by considering whether stressors experienced by the worker had been unusual and excessive on an objective basis. These events are to be examined objectively in the sense required under the Policy, either because they fall within the express statutory inclusions (i.e., 'a wilful and intentional act' or 'a fortuitous event occasioned by a physical or natural cause') or because they should be included by judicial interpretation. There is no causal link between the injury and the stressors. There were differing tests applied by different appeal commissioners. The issue at the heart of the appeal is whether the board applied the correct legal test in light of the evidence in this record. In light of that finding, it is consistent with the principles very recently enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC (CanLII). The Court did not understand WCAT's reasoning process was unreasonable in that, having found there were unusual or excessive workplace events or stressors, and faced with Ms. Frausin's evidence supporting causal links between those events and his stress injury, she failed to draw that causal link."

When the defendant notified the plaintiff that it was going to cancel the policy, the plaintiff placed a second policy on the property. The fire occurred less than a day before the first policy was to be cancelled. The defendant refused to honour the policy. It claimed that the formal Proof of Loss filed by the plaintiff was fraudulent, as it failed to disclose the existence of the second policy. Finding for the plaintiff, that the defendant has not satisfied the heavy burden of producing clear and satisfactory evidence that the plaintiff, through its employees, acted wilfully and knowingly to claim the benefit of coverage to which it was not entitled.","This was an action involving a contest between two insurance companies. The defendant had placed two policies of insurance for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff against one insured company for non-payment of the insurance premium. The plaintiff failed to disclose the existence of the second policy.

d_2007nspc68.txt,"The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code; and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08. The accused denied having care or control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of either charge.  1) The risk assessment should not involve conjecture or speculation. It may be speculation to conclude that every driver whose BAC exceeds 80, might change his mind; however, it would be wrong to preclude a trial court from assessing the risk of change of intention, on the facts of the individual case, especially where it is accepted that one effect of the consumption of alcohol is the impairment of judgment. The Court found that there were no elements of risk to the public other than the possibility of the accused changing his mind. 2) The accused's acts involved the use of the car's equipment to turn the key in the ignition to the accessories position and to play music on the stereo. 3) There was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally, or of its thereby becoming a danger to the general public."
4_2006skca76.txt,"The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","The appellant appealed an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. The father paid some maintenance for the child and had extensive access to the child, she spending most of the time with her maternal grandparents. He alleged that the mother was an alcoholic and as result did not properly care for the children. The mother filed an affidavit denying all of the allegations, and in particular, that she was the alcoholic and that her alcoholism adversely affected the child. She also filed affidavits from three friends and the 16 year old daughter to support her own evidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed. Even assuming that the Investigation Record was adduced into evidence by reason of reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998, with viva voce evidence, there was no case for even direction of the trial of an issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.

e_2000canlii19619.txt,"Accused charged with impaired driving, being over.08 and driving while disqualified. The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases.

HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2 in the Information. 1) The Court was unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the first sample was obtained within 2 hours of the accident. There was no bad intent on the part of the officers nor did there be tailoring of the evidence. 2) There must be a manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behavior in order for the Crown to find that there has been a breach of fundamental justice. 3) The trial judge may consider reliance on the presumption in s258.(1)(c) in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness notwithstanding the conduct complained of.

Application for summary judgment granted. The evidence showed that only an offer to lease had been made, with no lease agreement ever having actually been signed, and that the individual with whom the landlord had dealt was only intended to be a guarantor and never a tenant.","The Trustee in bankruptcy received a voluntary assignment for bankruptcy by the Superintendent of Bankruptcy on September 9, 2005.

The evidence advanced by County Realty is overwhelming that the basic facts required to show consensus on the fundamentals of lease do not exist.

He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial. No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.","The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.

In dealing with count 4, the trial judge learned only of the Crown's allegation that the appellant had driven while disqualified pursuant to ss. 253 and 254 of the Code. He also held that he would not be improper for the judge to preside over the trial on the impaired driving, refusal and obstruction charges. The trial judge concluded that the defect could be cured by severing count 5, the charge concerning impaired driving and refusing a breath demand.  1) The Court of Appeal held with respect to the appellant's appeal that no reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of this trial judge's decision. 2) It is inevitable that the criminal histories of mere mortals will play a role in making decisions that are inevitable in the course of a criminal trial. This is so in this case for the first time that the court was in agreement with the decision of the Chambers judge. It does not automatically disqualify the accused from proceeding on the first three counts. It is therefore inevitable that such a normal and normal course of judgment will play out in the criminal justice system. 3) There is no natural process to automatically sever the information from the charge of driving while disqualified. It was simply an application to delay the trial by a day or two.

c_1997canlii1639.txt,"This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff went on maternity leave for six months. During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff.

She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice. Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice, that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice. This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause.","This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal where the plaintiff contends that she was constructively dismissed without notice by her employer, the defendant. The issues were whether there was constructive dismissal, at what point did the plaintiff have notice of the changes which constituted constructive dismissal? HELD: The appropriate period of notice was 8 months. The plaintiff was awarded damages on the basis of eight months salary at the rate she was receiving at the time of her employment, plus vacation pay of 6% per annum and interest from July 14th to September 14th 1997. 1)It is of course an essential ingredient of constructive dismissal that the employee have absolutely failed to militage. 2)In this case the plaintiff was not only wrongfully dismissed but her employment was being terminated. 3)The employer bore the responsibility of clearly informing the employee of proposed changes. The fact that Maternity Leave is provided under the Employment Insurance Act for employed mothers is designed to provide employed mothers an opportunity to give to the new born the total care that is required in order for the child to have a good start in life. 4)The plaintiff had no notice of these changes until the letter of June 1997, which put in process events which led to the constructive dismissal as of July 14. 1997. She was, therefore, wrongfully dismissal. 5)In terms of damages, the Court favoured the testimony of the plaintiff as opposed to the defendant's. 6)The Court was of the view that the plaintiff's recollections of the discussions were more accurate and reliable."

One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care. While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home. The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort. The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way. HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall. The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father. Joint custody was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines.","The parents of two young boys, nine and 11, require a framework for parenting. Joint custody is not opposed. The father has had primary residence by interim order but that arrangement has been fraught with difficulty for reasons which will be explored. The mother, Sherri, asks that the boys' principal residence be varied and awarded to her. HELD: 1) The best interests test governs the determination on the issue of primary residence. Although the father is 34 years of age and has four older children of other relationships, the Court has found him not entitled to the child tax credit, child support paid by the father of the two children and the Child Tax benefits and employment supplement are the only sources of income for the father. He has abdicated a significant chunk of his caregiving role to his mother and sisters. His unfortunate injuries in the motor vehicle accident did not inspire him to adopt a spirit of compromise. He is currently receiving income replacement benefits from SGI based on 90% of his income. Although he was employed full-time, the father was responsible for the care of the children and was sometimes late picking them up. He was also involved in renovations to the mother's home. The parties lived in the home for several months. One of the parties was found to be in a relationship with the children. It was concluded that the father had been unable to meet his obligations under the agreement reached at the pre-trial conference. The Court declined to release the names of the people who had facilitated the arrangement. 2) The father is currently employed full time, earning $1,600 a year. However, he is contributing to the renovations. The boys live with the mother. There are no boarders at the time of this writing. 3) The parties met at a mediation conference in December 2010 and agreed that the parties would continue to receive Child Tax credit for all the children, with the exception of the oldest child, who was in the driver's seat. There was no settlement and the matter was set for trial in February 2012. It is pertinent to note that the petitioner is a party to the proceedings."
b_2016skqb29.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made in 2005. The court assumed that the imputation was correct. The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them. The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","The respondent applies for an order to discontinue his obligation to pay both child and spousal support and further for all support arrears to be expunged. He relies upon s. 17 of the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, and s. 14 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. HELD: 1) The original order was correct at the time it was made. The matter did not proceed beyond the interim stage. Rather, from April 2005 through to the present, the respondent has been content to have the existing order in place and did not seek to challenge it by way of trial proceedings to obtain a final order different from that pronounced by McIntyre J. 2) The respondent is able to establish he has been working at full-time employment for the past four years. In those years he earned actual income from full time position. This actual situation does constitute material change. There is little doubt it will be onerous for him but then, on the other hand, he has avoided paying anything for considerable period of time. In the result, am not prepared to expunge any of the arreears prior to 2013. 3) The Court must accept the original decision was correct. It must then determine whether the Arrears of support be varied retroactively to impute a different, albeit lower, income than that imputed in 2005. The respondent says simply he did not earn the income that was imputed to him by the petitioner. What he is really saying is the imputed amount was wrong and he should not be saddled with such high income for the purposes of the calculation of support purposes. The reason why income had to be imputed is because of mental health difficulties. The petitioner suffered from depression for several years and was unable to find employment in his chosen field or otherwise to continue to earn an income. It appears he was not able to continue with the manufacture of the invention, because of the difficulty he had to rely on or for the respondent to assist with the post-secondary expenses. It does not appear he is unlikely to be able to pay in the future."

The Arbitrator's award favoured the A &amp; E Rail Contractor's position. Leave to appeal had been granted. At issue was were whether the arbitrator applied the correct measure of damages and whether there was any evidence to support the findings of fact. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed. The respondent's application for enforcement of the award was granted without costs. 1)The issues were questions of fact not law. The errors complained of were the same questions referred to the arbitrator for determination. Adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' did not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law. The wording on the second issue was changed slightly to read 'in his calculation as to damages awarded for increased costs of winter construction'. There was some evidence upon which the arbitrator could make a finding of fact. 2)As none of the bars set out in the Act applied the court was required by s50(3) to give judgment enforcing the award.  3)The application for costs on a solicitor and client basis was denied.

Dismissing the application, that the evidence sought to be admitted was either available at trial and was not adduced, was repetitious of evidence given at trial, or was evidence which could not be expected to affect the decision.","This was an appeal from an order of the Family Court dismissing the appellant's application to terminate a permanent custody order respecting her son who had been taken into care by the Children's Aid Society shortly after his birth. HELD: The application to adduce evidence on appeal was dismissed. The principles for the reception of fresh evidence were set out in R. v. Palmer (1979) and the Civil Procedure Rule 62.22 which is the general rule governing the hearing of an appeal. The fresh evidence rule was stated to apply in the following ways: 1) the evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases. (2) The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it is reasonably capable of believe, and (3) It must be credible so that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence at trial, be expected to have affected the result."
7_1998canlii13397.txt,"The petitioner sought retroactive child and spousal support of $47,367. No children were presently dependent upon her and she was self-sufficient. The parties married in 1963. The mother was a homemaker until 1983 when they bought and operated a small town hotel which ultimately failed in 1990. The petitioner alleged they separated in 1990 when the father left the province to seek work elsewhere. He sent no money for two years until 1992 when he sent $3,200 and bought a washer and dryer. She commenced a divorce action in 1996 which was adjourned sine die by consent. The marriage was dissolved in June 1998. The respondent did not keep records of money sent as he did not consider they had separated until 1993. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1)Nothing turned on the actual date of separation which was difficult to determine. The mother was entitled to make a claim for support whenever she believed his contribution was inadequate, whether or not she perceived herself separated from him. 2)The primary purpose of a support order is not to compensate for past failure but to satisfy present need. Making a retroactive order would not address that purpose. She did not make a claim until 1996 and then did not prosecute her claim for another two years, at a time when neither she nor the children were dependent.","The mother sought retroactive child and spousal support. She claimed her former husband did not pay sufficient support when both she and the children were dependent upon him. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The primary purpose of a support order is not tocompensate for past failure but rather, satisfy present need. Making a retroactive support order would not add to the purpose. The claim was dismissed; there would be no order. 2)The mother was entitled to make a claim for support whenever she believed the father's contribution to be inadequate, whether or not she perceived herself separated from him. But she did not do so until 1996 and then did not prosecute her claim for another two years, at a time when neither she nor the childrenwere dependent. 3)It was not difficult to determine the date of separation.

The appellant asserted the respondent acted fraudulently by failing to make full disclosure of the facts surrounding the cause of loss. Dismissing the appeal, that the respondent did not wilfully make any false statement, and answered all questions as required on the documents provided. Her silence in the face of uncertainty over her in-laws involvement in the fire did not constitute fraud.

The appellant claimed payment of the sum of $20,000 plus expenses associated with investigating and adjusting the loss. The respondent's insurer appealed the decision. Appeal dismissed; in every case where fraud has been found, the insurer has relied in its factum on the statutory conditions as basis for its claim; the failure of the appellant to advise her sister of the possibility that the Nicholsons arranged the fire does not constitute fraud or wilful false statement; the insurer must make full disclosure of the circumstances of the case."
7_2010nssc146.txt,"The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence. Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.","The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging that the Crown's intention to adduce the newly discovered evidence has adversely affected her s. and 11(d) Charter rights. She had no knowledge of the contents of the prisoner package seized following the search of Thomas Izzard and of the other evidence seized from her home pursuant to a search warrant executed soon thereafter. To that end, she negotiated a number of matters with the Crown. At very early stage of the trial, defence counsel was aware that the new evidence could be used to impeach the accused's testimony and contradict things she had told to Sergeant Kelly in her video taped statement. The accused sought and was granted a continuance of the publication ban on the 'newly discovered evidence' mentioned in the decision.HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had succeeded in proving a breach of her right to make full answer and defence. The evidence goes to the mens rea element of the offences alleged against the accused and goes directly to the issue of her credibility. The Crown had made significant decisions regarding the conduct of its case, including not re-electing a judge by mistake and making arrangements for her re-election. It is obvious that not every late disclosure will prejudice a defence. However, in this case, the accused took positive steps to place her knowledge and intent at issue. She agreed to have the tape statement go in without contest. During that video, she raises an issue of willful blindness."

The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure. He argued all committee members, except the union representative, should be excluded by reason of bias. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. 1)The material did not meet the test for the admission of fresh evidence. It simply restated what was at issue and found to have had no effect. 2)There was no tenable basis for interfering. The remedies are discretionary. 3)The Court was not prepared to grant the relief in any event, given the long delay in seeking recourse. The initial concern was bias and jurisdiction. The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below. 4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations.

c_1998canlii13762.txt,"The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s27 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell them the lands which were subject to their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation. The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution. The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal.

The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions. The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue. The mother sought sole custody with generous access. The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication. Allowing the mother's application, that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say. Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues. As the parties lacked flexibility, a detailed access plan was incorporated.","The parties separated in June 1992 and the respondent voluntarily left the matrimonial home in November 1992. There has been a marriage breakdown and the divorce is granted. The parties have two children, a son born January 1989 and a daughter September 1988. The respondent seeks equal parental control and responsibility by an order for joint custody under s.16(4) of the Divorce Act. The mother seeks to be the final decision maker in matters relating to the children's welfare, growth and development while being prepared to promote maximum contact between the children and their father to the extent that this is consistent with the best interests of the children. The day to day physical custody is granted by mutual agreement. The Corollary Relief order shall reflect the parties' agreement for each parent to hold in trust and administer one-half the investments and would remind the parties they are responsible and accountable for the monies. HELD: 1)The Matrimonial Property Act was not working on a day-to-day decision making basis. The present joint custody is not working as a result of the marriage breakdown. The children have had the benefit of one constant, outside the home, sitter, whom the father has designated as their guardian during the weeks they are with him. This pattern so early on does not fair well for a continued joint custodial arrangement. To date it has not been the 'occasional resort' to the court referred to in Krugger v. Krugger (1980), 11 R.F.L. (2d) 52. It could be any combination of factors. 2)The Custodial Alternatives sole or joint custody proposal, proposed by the respondent, was reviewed. It was agreed that the children would have weekly access with their father who would pick them up at 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday and Wednesday from either the mother's home or their place of normal activity (such as day care, school or a sport's field) and that they would alternate times on the weekends."

Dismissing the action, that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way.

Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower. The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D&S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence. It is alleged that the defendant failed to perform as agreed and in consequence the plaintiff seeks damages. The defendant resists the claim and by way of a counterclaim seeks judgment for extras requested by the plaintiff.

He was awarded the sum of $4,007.83 as damages. 2) The appraiser was not liable for the whole of the damage. 3) Although the plaintiff was in Phoenix only once in early 1994, he was struck by two things which were part of the Phoenix house: the pillars and the roof. It does not seem likely he would then speak with his contractor about only the one. The other thing that seems to be the cause of the delay is the fact that there was a discussion about round pillars and it was intended that they would be a part of a contract. However, the defendant simply forgot about the discussion. This is only the prima facie measure. Considerations of reasonableness are capable of displacing it, as they did in the case of the plaintiff who paid $37,000 for extras."

However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba).

d_1997canlii11439.txt,"The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The deceased made a will and codicil in November 1989 and December 11, 1989 respectively. Neither made any provision for the younger child. The executors were directed to hold the farmlands and improvements in trust for him until he attains the age of twenty-one years. The residue was subject to sale in the Executor's absolute discretion with the like discretion to apply the net income and to encroach on capital for the maintenance of the child until he reaches the ripe old age. The father sought an order under the Dependents' Relief Act varying child maintenance from $150 per child to $1,245 per month for the two children. HELD: 1)Nothing within the will, read as a whole, with reference to the ordinary rules of construction,requires the term 'personal effects' to be given anythingother than its ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the Testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. The term is not a physical chattel having some personal connection with the deceased. It is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others. A more generous award may result. 2)The estate was substantially smaller, the children had a longer period of dependency and there would be a reserves remaining for unknown contingencies and undetermined costs and expenses. These calculations are only crude estimation but have attempted to consider the children's current needs weighed against what the Estate can reasonably bear in all the unknown circumstances, while still giving effect to the testingator's intentions to preserve the farmland in specie for conveyance to the children at twenty years of age."
8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondents following trial on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of s. 26(a) of the Saskatchewan Fisheries Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan. The Crown argued that it was not necessary for the Crown to prove anything with respect to commercial fishing in order to make out all the charges against their clients. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law by failing to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and an aboriginal right for commercial purposes. While some of this evidence was allowed to come out at trial, the Crown made no effort to establish that the respondents had an aboriginal right. Commercial fishing is not an issue in this case."
d_2010skqb458.txt,"Supplementary reasons to 2010 SKQB 439. The petitioner served the respondent with a formal offer of settlement on September 14, 2010. The offer was not accepted and the matter proceeded to trial. A week after the trial was concluded and while the decision was reserved, the offer was revoked. The petitioner applies for costs against the respondent pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184B. HELD: Queen's Bench Rule 184B calls for double costs from the date of service of the offer. The fact the offer was revoked does not alter the concept in Rule 184B and the resulting sanction. The petitioner was awarded party to party costs under Column 3 up to September 14, 2010 and double party of party costs under Column 3 thereafter, together with the costs for this application. All costs were payable forthwith.","The petitioner served the respondent with a formal offer of settlement on September 14, 2010. The offer was not accepted (and indeed never was accepted) and the case proceeded to trial. About a week after the conclusion of the trial, the petitioner revoked his offer. HELD: The petitioner was awarded party to party costs under Column 3. 1)The purpose of making formal offers to settle pursuant to the Queen's Bench Rules of Court is obvious. The issues that were litigated were a substantial and merited trial. 2)The sanction so to speak of not accepting a reasonable offer properly tendered and proceeding to trial was found in Queen’s Bench Rule 184B and Rule 545."
1990canlii4096.txt,"This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","The respondent applied for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings in respect of charges prosecuted against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (I.D.A.). The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The respondent had been found guilty of professional misconduct. The appeal Division found that the circumstances in which the respondent was found to be in did not meet the test set out in McFetridge v. Nova Scotia Barristers' Society (18.S.R. (2d) 319. The trial judge reversed the respondent's decision and ordered a new hearing. This was a very special case and the normal test in interim injunction cases is to find on a balance of convenience that it is necessary to obtain time for the court to adjudicate the issues arising from the special circumstances of the case and that the consequences of not staying in the lower proceedings would be serious and irreversible."
4_2005nspc10.txt,"The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with trafficking, cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, and possession of property obtained by crime. The accused was a student at the time and had been approached by several youth standing near the wharf. One of the officers noticed a large amount of alcohol in the passenger area of the vehicle and noticed a knapsack on the floor. When he picked up the accused, he felt heavy and could feel what he thought might be bottles of cocaine and cash. When the police approached the vehicle, they found a backpack stuffed with cocaine, beer and cash, and at subsequent search at the police station it was found to contain an unopened bottle of Olands Export Ale, 32 grams of cannabis marijuana, and bundles of cash containing $3000 in total, a digital scale, and other items of personal nature such as an eyeglass case, toothbrush and deodorant. The Crown called two other witnesses to testify. HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of all three charges before it.  1) The Court accepted the uncontroverted expert evidence that the amounts of both marijuana and cocaine and all of the circumstances establish that the possession was for the purposes of trafficking and so find. 2) The Crown did not call evidence but argued that this was a circumstantial case in which the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the only reasonable inference to be drawn was that the drugs and money were in the possession of the accused. 3) The evidence was admissible against the accused because the accused had knowledge of the presence of the item in question, consented to its presence and had some measure of control over it."
e_2006skca55.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the court accepting fresh evidence. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed. There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed. 1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission. 2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us. All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay. Any evidence sought to be adduced under the discretion of what is now s. 683 of the Code must be admissible evidence. With respect to the evidence of Ms. Brinkman, she does not swear that Ms. Bodkin was selling methamphetamine at the relevant time. 3) With respect to due diligence, it must be noted that the appellant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who represents him before this court. The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward. If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems. 4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered.","The appellant appeals his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the Court accepting fresh evidence. The central issue at trial was whether the drugs found at the premises being rented by one s. Bodkin belonged to the appellant. The appellant did not follow the procedure outlined by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Lévesque in making this fresh evidence application. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed.  1) The Court's focus is on credibility. The Crown's case is based, in large measure, on the evidence of the complainant, who was a large drug user at the time of the alleged offence. While clearly not determinative, the avoidance of evidence-splitting with all of its attendant problems results in the same result. 2) The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief and it must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result. 3) There would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal was dismissed."

The applicant sought a declaration that the plaintiffs' solicitors had breached confidentiality and were in a conflict of interest and asked that they be removed as solicitors of record in this action.

The applicant argued that a fiduciary relationship was created when the documents were accepted which was close enough to a solicitor-client retainer to give rise to a need for confidentiality and that the public's confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined if any member of that law firm acted for the plaintiffs.

There was no breach of confidentiality or conflict of interest as contemplated by Chapters IV and V of the Code of Professional Conduct.

b_2003nssf19.txt,"The Agency applied for the permanent care of four young children, aged 2 to 5 years. The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met. The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them. Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional. Neither parent could, nor wished to, change in the foreseeable future.","The Agency applied for permanent care of four children. The first child, S.M., was 5 years old at the time of her birth. The second child, O.D., was approximately 9 months old at that time. The third child (R.M.) was born approximately 15 months later and had continued head lice infestation. The Agency had made a referral to Children's Aid when the mother was expecting her second child (S.M.). The Agency denied any knowledge of the child's medical history, alleged that the child had been neglectful and using corporal punishment as a method of disciplining her. The child, who lived with the mother and her grandparents for approximately one-half of her lifetime, was diagnosed as having Conduct Disorder and Oppositional Defiant Disorder. Family Skills continued to visit the residence approximately once a week. On July 17, 2001, the mother, who was pregnant with the third child, informed the Agency that the children were in need of protective services and that three of the children would remain in the care of the Agency with access to the mother. On December 20, 2000, the Agency advised the parents that they would have to increase the duration of access visits and the number of visits by the parents would be increased. On January 16, 2001 the Agency made another referral to the Child Abuse Test and Child Stress and Substantive Abuse Test. On February 20, 2002 the Agency heard from the Family Skills Worker who conducted the assessment on all of the parties except N.D. The children had continued to be in temporary care and there was consideration given to moving the supervised access visits out of Agency Office and into a more comfortable location in the Respondents home. HELD: The children were placed in permanent care with the Agency and that order was granted. During the adjournment period of time, the matter would be adjourned to allow a summary or discussion based on all the findings and the information provided by the Agency on the three children and their mother.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The appellant had the onus of satisfying the three conditions of s.679(3) of the Criminal Code. He abided by the terms of the release and had strong economic and family ties to his community. The real issue was the question of the public interest. 2)The grounds of appeal were not frivolous nor did it seem that there was much risk that he would not appear in court when ordered.  3)Bail was granted pending sentencing on all the cases referred to except for Smale, which was more than a month closer to the date of his conviction.

Throughout the marriage, the wife had been working and living with her mother, who was on a Canada Pension Plan disability. He received a severance package and pension was to start in September 2005. The applicant's income is now primarily derived from his pension. The wife's circumstances are the same as they were at the time of the granting of the divorce. Although the applicant had some employment since retirement, he has been the sole provider for their 16 year old son, Tyler. Although there is no cure for Ms. Fraser's illness, it is manageable. She has home and could take in boarders. However, her effort to take one university course resulted in her hospitalization. Her unchanged circumstances are juxtaposed against the applicant's decrease in income and his responsibility to meet the needs of their son. The court found that the father's obligation to the wife should extend beyond the length of their marriage was not time-limited and he could find no rationale for doing so as her need continued based on her disability."

He requested two 1999 orders be amended to the extent necessary to give the relief requested. The brothers had been involved in a dispute over the division of farming assets since July 1999. A third party commenced legal action in QB No.3510/99 against the brothers and garnisheed revenues from the Pregnant Mare Urine operation for approximately 1 year. The brother's application for an injunction to permit him to take over the operation was dismissed in the January 12, 2001 fiat. His application to set aside the garnishee summonses was granted and all sums paid into court and interest were to be returned subject to provisions in fiat QB No.2259/99. The plaintiff alleged the breach of conditions in the previous orders entitled him to bring this application. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs of $750 payable forthwith.

The balance of liability for the corporate defendants and the partnership was set aside at the time of the order. 2)Each party was awarded costs in the cause."
c_2003skqb58.txt,"Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act. The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision. The Crown did not seek costs.","The plaintiffs apply for certification under The Class Actions Act on behalf of the following classes as set forth in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim: Veterans Resident Class Any Indian person who, as defined under the Indian Act, was not informed of nor was he offered any benefits that he was entitled to by reason of his service either in World War I, World II or the Korean War as did non-aboriginal veterans. The claim for damages arising from silicone breast implants designed, manufactured and marketed by the defendants. The plaintiffs claim entitlement to 'Survivors' Pensions' during the Class Period as common-law partners of Contributors. HELD: The action was dismissed as statute-barred. 1) Only if the class members succeed in this litigation and reach the bureaucratic stage of applying for the ex gratia payment will the question of individual issues arise. 2) There are a number of limitations issues, some of which are common and others that will be individual to class members. The Court should be reluctant to deny plaintiff his or her day in court. 3) The test in Canada governing the application of provisions like Rule 19(24)(a) of the British Columbia Rules of Court is the same as that in England, if there is a chance that the Indian War Veterans were denied the 'right' to apply for veteran's benefits. There is nothing before the court to indicate that they were not properly informed of their right to apply. 4) There is no bar to the bringing of motions even at the pre-certification stage of the proceedings. The argument on this certification application concluded on January 30. Any members of the proposed class who are eligible to make application should be provided with as much time as may reasonably be possible to decide whether they will make the application or continue with litigation."
d_2005skca149.txt,"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. The Crown appealed the decision. Appeal allowed; the Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the YCJA as the sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. The court focused unduly on the provincial director's lack of authority to'suspend' community supervision under s. 102(2) and the contrast in this regard with the power of the director under s106 to suspend conditional supervision. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1) The proper Interpretation of Section 102(3) is based on the fact that s102(2)(a) includes the word 'apprehension' after the reference to s107 merely as an aid to the reader. The Court accepted the Crown's argument and found that the youth justice system was unique in that it did not provide for the application of s106 which was the source of the authority for the suspension of community supervision. 2) Section 107(1) provides for an order under s103 of the Criminal Code. It does not refer to s.107(1)(b) nor does it express the power to suspend which is provided for under s102 of the Code. In this case, the youth was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. The youth was convicted of break and enters, theft, weapons offence and drug offence. The sentence had ended prior to the matter coming before her for disposition."

Valuations of the family home and property were made, and exemptions and equitable considerations were addressed. Equalization payments were prescribed. As the results of the action were mixed, no costs were ordered.","The parties were previously before the court in an action for custody, access, support, divorce and division of family property. Due to change in circumstances, it was necessary to sever of the matters of custody and access and support. The sole issue was the issue of the valuation of the family home. HELD: 1) The matrimonial property or its value, both as defined in s. 2, be distributed equally, subject only to the exceptions, exemptions and equitable considerations mentioned in the statute. The value for distribution is $95,100. 2) There is nothing in the evidence that would lead to a conclusion that the date of adjudication is to be preferred over the time of application. Where the value is based on third party information, that party was not produced at trial in order that the value could be tested. 3) The family home is in excess of 65 hectares (160.62 acres) by 0.5614 hectares (1.38 acres). There is no evidence as to how the value was arrived at other than an inspection of the property. The evidence was accepted as it was as of the application. 4) The evidence is not independent evidence; it is the evidence of the parties. 5) The Court fixed July 2005 as the application date.

It was important that he be reintroduced to his 10 year old daughter in a gradual and consistent fashion. He was granted access intitially for three and four hours in both provinces, then two days at the father's parent's home including overnight access and two days in the summer in British Columbia.

It was important that he be reintroduced to his daughter in a gradual and consistent fashion. He had not seen his daughter for in over 3 years. 2)It was expected that the father would be travelling to Saskatchewan before the end of June and accordingly David should be given an opportunity to see his daughter more often.

e_1984canlii199.txt,"The Plaintiff contracted to provide market survey to the Defendant. Before its completion, the contract was replaced by second contract for Fund Development Officer. Each party had a different understanding of the duties of the Fund Development Officer which misunderstanding the Judge classified as a mutual mistake. The failure of performance by plaintiff entitled defendant to repudiate the contract. Defendant's counterclaim for rescission of first agreement, and repayment of monies paid under second agreement, failed where it accepted plaintiff's performance and paid consideration therefore.","This was an action brought by Fossil Fuel Development Ltd. against Tudex Petroleums Ltd.

HELD: Fossil's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)Each party was mistaken as to the other's intention, though neither realized that the respective promises had been misunderstood. 2)The relationship between the principal officer of Fossil and the plaintiff was defined as one where each party induced the other to enter into an agreement to bring in investment capital. 3)The plaintiff had accepted the performance by the defendant on the marketing study and the defendant's payment for the month of September was enclosed by Crooks with the letter. 4)A mutual mistake existed. Lovell was hired as fund development officer. The question was what was intended by that designation. The parol evidence rule was used to justify the use of the term 'fund development officer'. When there was a failure of performance by a defendant in an essential part of a contract, the defendant was entitled to repudiate it. The plaintiff was not required to testify. 5)A substantial amount of the plaintiff's evidence was left to the defendant, who admitted that he was not induced to enter the agreement on the basis of misrepresentation or misrepresentation. The evidence was that the defendant induced the plaintiff to enter an agreement whereby significant sums of money were to be paid to the plaintiff for the purpose of introducing potential investors to its product. The defendant thought Fossil was a tool for the exploration of oil and gas and did not intend its investment to be more or less the same. That is not mere speculation.

b_2012skqb443.txt,The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their children. The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner. The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal. HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it. The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it. The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.,"FIAT: The court has ruled on the substantive aspect of the application in separate fiat and rendered my decision in respect of the admissibility of some of the evidence the respondent put before the court. HELD: The application at bar is another salvo in a bitter custody and access dispute. Settlement negotiations are protected by settlement privilege which is a jointly held privilege that cannot be waived by any one party acting alone. This privilege is fundamental to the policy interest of promoting settlement discussions as means to avoiding trial. It should only be set aside if there is a very compelling, competing policy warranting such a waiver. As settlement communications are almost always irrelevant to the issues that are properly considered by the Court, it is rare that there will be any competing policy or, indeed, any reason to reference them at all. This is gamesmanship and nothing more."
b_2005nssf21.txt,"The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.","The parties were married for thirteen years and had three children, aged 12, 11, and 9. The parties lived in the matrimonial home with the father until they separated in 2002. The children have been residing with the mother since separation and the mother has been exercising regular access. The father is opposed to the payment of spousal support in any form, arguing that he does not earn enough to pay such an expense and that Ms. Faddoul does not need support. HELD: The parties agree that a Joint Custody Order shall issue and that primary care shall remain with her. The mother wants meaningful consultation and input into major decisions respecting the upbringing and activities of the children. While this expense had not been incurred at the time of the trial, there was no question that it is necessary and imminent. The evidence of 'necessary repairs' advanced by the mother is not sufficient to move away from the appraisals. This is a case where the standard of living enjoyed by the children is better than that of the father. The parents must cooperate in obtaining passports for the children and the father must provide notice of the activity and the cost."

HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached.

There was no waiver of the delay caused by the adjournments from May 2004 to November 2005. 2) The weather caused delay from November 29, 2006 to January 19, 2007. 3) Evidence was led by the accused that she suffered actual prejudice because the outstanding charge has affected her ability to apply for higher-paying job opportunities and has caused her stress and frustration. She further alleges that the passage of time makes it more difficult to properly defend against the charges. Actions of the accused. The accused did not contribute to the delay. There were some delays attributable to the accused in time until she was ready to enter pleas, and later until she could have the matter rescheduled for trial. Otherwise, she appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charges set. 4) There is no evidence that any lack of institutional resources caused any delays. 5) As indicated in Morin, prejudice can be inferred from prolonged delay. It was found that there was a heightened prejudice in the nature of the offences resulting in the delay resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached on these charges.

3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of the defendant's cattle getting into her canola field in late July 1999. The defendant admitted that his cattle were in the plaintiff's crop on one occasion but said that there was no evidence they were in any other location. HELD: Judgment for the plaintiff and pre-judgment interest was granted in the amount of $2,533.45. The cattle owner is strictly liable for damage caused by his cattle. The fact remains that the cattle did move onto the field unbeknownst to the defendant, his spouse, his brother, or his hired help. The Carrot River did not prove to be an impediment to the cattle' ability to move around. The plaintiff's cattle were found to have been in the field on more than one occasion and there were no other cattle present. The court found that the average crop loss for cattle in the rural municipality was $3,052.36 and that other cattle were not in the crop at all. As the plaintiff had been unable to combine most of the field but were put to the expense and inconvenience of having to combine around the numerous yard-square plots and poor areas, and combine those plots separately, reduce damages by only 5% for this factor. The damages sustained by the plaintiffs were reduced by 5% as the defendant displace the actual crop value."

HELD: 1) The respondent has deemed additional income of $50,000 and $27,200 from the two companies. 2) The imputed annual income of the respondent is $150,000. 3) Costs in the amount of $750 to the petitioner.","The issue between the parties was the amount of child maintenance payable by the respondent to the petitioner for the benefit of Brady Melvin, born January 9, 1993. The amount of the respondent's income, as reported in his income tax return for the years 2001, 2002, and 2003 was $71,501.00, $73,272.00 and $74,476.00. He asserted that the indebtedness of the company was $1,600,000. However, the long term debt was only $148,750 and was deducted before calculation of retained earnings. HELD: The respondent was ordered to pay $750 based on the total income for the petitioner and $800 on the basis of $96,800 for child maintenance and $561.00 per month for hockey expenses. 1)The respondent was the sole shareholder of Canadian Well Servicing Ltd. and he owns 50% of the shares of Southern Range Well. His net earnings, and retained earnings for the past four years were: Year net earnings of $50,000; year net earnings in excess of $1 million; net income of $27,200; and child maintenance adjusted accordingly.  2)The petitioner was entitled to costs of the application."
9_2008skqb429.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received. There will be no costs awarded for this unsuccessful application.","FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. The defendants entered into a mortgage with the plaintiff in April 2005 for land described as: Lot 4, Block 17, Plan No. 85SC07177, Extension 0, Burstall. The mortgage was renewed for a year period with a maturity date of March 14, 2008. The plaintiff applied ex parte for an appointment for hearing of an application pursuant to the Land Contracts (Actions) Act for leave to commence an action in February 2008. This was not in compliance with s. 3(2) of the Act which prescribes that an application may be brought after the expiration of 30 clear days from the date of service on the Provincial Mediation Board.

d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The defendant brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order compelling the plaintiff to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant. The second motion requested that the plaintiff cross examine the defendant on her affidavit. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1) The usual approach to civil litigation does not allow for plaintiff to demand defendant produce plaintiff. Secondary the wording of s. 14 and s. 24 of the Act precludes this type of pre-certification notice. However, the plaintiff has had ample opportunity to acquaint herself with prospective plaintiffs through some lawful manner. 2) The plaintiff does not seek through this motion to restrain the defendant from distributing the package nor does it seek to have the court direct the defendant to change any portion of the material. The affidavit was filed for the sole purpose of providing the evidence that the Roussys had settled with Red Seal and therefore could not be viable parties to this action. The purpose of the affidavit was to give the defendant an opportunity to introduce the names of the nine property owners who have, to date, received the package. The action is still an 'action' and not a 'class action'. 3) The Court's inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised judicially and only when the relief sought cannot reasonable and realistically be obtained by the applications. Any intervention by the court prior to certification should be narrowly directed and sparingly employed. 4) The wording of the statement of claim in this motion is novel. It is not clear how it confers jurisdiction on the court to make orders prior to the certification of proceedings as a class action since the section expressly refers to 'class members'. The usual practices and application of the common law regarding civil litigation apply. The practices and the implementation of the Rule 82(6) and S. 7(7) of the Saskatchewan Rules of Court do not get suspended merely because this matter has been brought under the Class Actions act. 5) It is important to keep in mind that the majority of civil actions are still in their infancy. In this case, the Court is still bound by the principles and jurisprudence of the day-to-day workings of the Court. It would be unfair to lock the plaintiff into an action if she did not provide notice to the defendant before certification. The Court would be loathe to interfere with what otherwise would be the normal rights of parties, and others, to conduct their affairs as they see fit."
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. It was clear that Ottenbreit J. set an order for fixed and short term in order to give the respondent an opportunity to find appropriate employment and become self sufficient. The fact that the respondent had had and still carries the burden of primarily maintaining Catherine was also a factor which militated against retroactive support. The order was based solely on calculation of the parties' respective incomes, as found or imputed. The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining Catherine on the basis she was over 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student."
c_1995canlii4546.txt,"The applicant sought a declaration that the province was responsible for providing school buildings for delivery of the public school program and that when buildings must be leased, the province bore the associated costs. The applicant, which leased six school buildings from the Roman Catholic Church, submitted the respondent was required to reimburse the applicant for leasing costs. For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs. Where the Minister received a request in the proper form and where it was determined leases were necessary, the leasing costs would be the respondent's responsibility.","The applicant school board sought a declaration that the Province was responsible to provide school buildings required for the delivery of a basic Public School Program. Included in the fifty-five schools are six school buildings leased by the Cape Breton Board from the Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Antigonish or other entities of the Roman Catholic Church. It is the responsibility for payment of the leasing cost on these buildings that is now before the Court. The issue is whether the Minister of Education (the 'Minister') is required to reimburse the board for the costs incurred by the board in leasing these buildings from the Church. The Court found that, because of the failure to follow the Education Act, the Province is not required, at least at this time, to pay the cost of these leases. The Board submitted there was an inequity where it is required, in order to deliver the basic public school program, to lease buildings from a third party, in this case the Church, while other boards are provided buildings free of rental cost. It may be that the Minister may wish to reconsider whether, pending the possible filing of a report by the the CapeBreton Board, additional interim funding is warranted in these circumstances."
7_1996canlii7107.txt,"The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600. The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amount of unpaid child support paid for his 2 daughters by one-half. An earlier corollary relief judgment was made in 1989 except that an order suspending enforcement of arrears during periods when the respondent was unemployed was granted. HELD: The application was dismissed. The father was ordered to file a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing income received from employment with the maintenance enforcement office commencing September 30, 1996 and every three month period until the arreaars are paid in full. 1)The father was employed and had custody of the 2 daughters. JUDGMENT: The Court ordered that the father pay child support of $300 per child per child during months when his gross monthly earnings are $2,200.00 or greater and $150.00 per child when he is less than $2200. This amount is to be paid in installments in addition to the on-going child support obligation. 2)The Court ordered the father to file affidavit evidence pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment in respect of his income. The Court was uncertain whether any income replacement benefits were available during his periods of unemployment."
b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be reserved on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now shows that substantial offers were made through counsel, although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The applicant argued that the Court needed to know the full extent of the estate so as to properly determine the applicant’s entitlement to the estate. HELD: 1)The applicant was awarded costs in lump sum. The respondent was ordered to pay the applicant post-judgment interest at a rate of five percent per annum from the date of the award until judgment is satisfied.  2)The Executions Act states that interest runs “from the time of entering judgment” and not from when the offer was made. The Court was faced with two equally untenable positions in determining costs. If the costs of the litigation were to be paid from the award date, the remainder may be insufficient to meet the application by the applicant. A settlement offered in September 1996 would have been equivalent to approximately $230,000 but, following the pre-trial conference, the respondent offered settlement at $156,000 which would approximate $230. This was not an appropriate case in which to order full solicitor & client costs. 3)Solicitor and client Costs are within the discretion of the Court and the re-hearing of this issue does not involve the merits of the case and was limited to the issue of costs. In the circumstances, the Court was satisfied that should reconsider the matter of costs since counsel had intended to continue to make further representations and lead further evidence about substantive offers made prior to trial and that evidence and submissions do have a direct bearing on solicitor andclient costs."
7_1995canlii4030.txt,"After a series of pre-trial conferences, and the exchange of some correspondence between the parties lawyers, the husband took the position that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of his pension. The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order that determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the respondent's pension plan during negotiations during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with written reasons to follow. 1)The court reviewed the relevant case law and found that settlement should not be taken as an application to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. 2)The respondent's correspondence with the appellant constituted an agreement to settle the matrimonial property issue. There was nothing in the evidence that suggested the parties intended that each individual item agreed to during the course of negotiations toward a final agreement would constitute separate, independent, binding and enforceable agreement irrespective of whether agreement was reached on all of the other items outstanding between the parties. Accordingly, there was no contract that the judge could enforce."

The applicant applied to determine whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia concerning the Quebec accident and to dismiss the action on the basis that Nova Scotia was a forum non conveniens. Application to dismiss the action dismissed; the forum conveniens is Nova Scotia. The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens. The substantive law governing the proceeding will be the law of the place where the accident occurred and the governing procedural law will be the law of the place of the trial.","The plaintiff sues in Nova Scotia regarding a motor vehicle accident that occurred in a different jurisdiction.

Unfortunately, the application does not say whether the plaintiff is barred from suing in the province of Quebec. The only issue that the applicants appear to have tried to resolve is whether the forum chosen is forum non conveniens. The court has nothing before them as to who did what, who agreed to what, and who disagreed with what prior to hearing of the application.

e_2010skca8.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows: Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent. If any directions should be required in relation to the execution of the order, the parties are given leave to informally apply for such directions through the Registrar's office.","Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to s 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under s 487.051(3) under s.487.060 of the Criminal Code. The judge declined, for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. HELD: The Court held the error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a whole—she has 53 prior convictions—and to have adequate regard for her objectives.

b_2008nspc5.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was revoked when he was found operating an all terrain vehicle (ATV) on a highway. Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along a highway in the community of Woods Harbour, Nova Scotia. His driver's license was revoked and he was charged with driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his licence was revoked. At trial, the Crown argued that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2) do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation was irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive the ATV. The defence argued that because the accused was driving on highway and his 'driver's license' was revoked he is guilty of the offence. At the trial, both the Crown and the accused's lawyers challenged the defence's argument that the use of an all-terrain vehicle on public highways is clearly prohibited under the Motor Vehicle Act. The only issue at trial was whether this makes the accused guilty of driving a vehicle on highway while he was revoked contrary to s.287(2). HELD: The Court found that the defence was clearly not exempting ATV's from the definition of motor vehicles in all provisions of the Motor vehicle Act. He was dealing with s. 230(1) and the phrase 'Motor vehicle registered or required to be registered under this Act'. He held that an ATX was not such a vehicle. The accused was acquitted of all charges at trial and the charge was dismissed. The Court held that it was not that simple and the defence did not exempt ATV’s from all references to “motor vehicles” in the Act. Even if the words “motiv vehicle” and “must be registered” were used within the section to determine whether the provision applies to the USE of ATVs or other prohibited vehicles. When the content, context and purpose of section 287(3) is considered find that the legislature intended for that subsection to prohibit the motor vehicles on highway by those individuals who had their licences or privilege of obtaining licences to do so cancelled, suspended, revoked or revoked. Before one can be guilty of such an offence find that it must be proven that they were driving motor vehicle of type or class for which they could properly have beenlicensed to drive on the road. In s. 11 there is no license that can be issued to drive one on the roadway.  1) It seems apparent, therefore, that one must consider the context in which the words are used within s. Motor Vehicle"
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","The accused was charged with five Criminal Code offences arising from incidents occurring on or about August 22, 2015 in Humboldt, Saskatchewan. The accused was convicted of dangerous driving, dangerous driving and assault. He appealed his conviction on dangerous driving. The trial judge focused on the fact that the accused overtook the complainant, pushed her towards the side of the road and beat her to the side. The complainant was not an overly cooperative witness. She refused to repeat any conversation she had with the accused based on spousal privilege. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge properly instructed herself on the law and that her findings of fact are supported by the evidence. There was nothing in the transcript which suggested that her decision was improperly exercised on either side. On the facts, the appellant's driving behaviour was a marked departure from the conduct expected of a reasonably prudent driver and not a momentary lapse. While some re-examination and re-weighing of the evidence is allowed to determine if it was reasonably capable of supporting a trial judge's conclusion, the court was not entitled to substitute its own opinion for that of that judge."
e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. They attended a French language school (École de Bellegarde) for the benefit of their children. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children's provisional permission to attend would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless children filed a complaint with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission (SHRC) alleging that the school had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. The CÉF applied to strike the plaintiffs' statement of claim as an abuse of process because the plaintiffs never applied for judicial review to set aside the appeal decision rendered by the elected directors of the school and their failure to encourage learning of the French language in partnership with the school. HELD: The Court held that s. 23 of the Charter gives it an exclusive and unfettered authority to decide whether it will admit any non-rights holders to attend a fransaskois school in Saskatchewan, and neither this Court nor the SHRC may inquire into its reasons or interfere with its exercise of its discretion.  1) The Court found that the plaintiffs had failed to live up to their commitments made to them in return for their assistance in helping to facilitate the integration of the children with a guide dog. 2) It was impossible for the plaintiffs to demonstrate that they had not made significant contributions to the community by ignoring and ignoring their commitments. 3) There was no evidence to support the claim on the basis of which the Court could have concluded that the statements of claim were not viable. The Court rejected the plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction."
4_2000canlii2523.txt,"The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval. In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","Land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval. The applicant applied for tentative subdivision approval in 1997 and received the same in 1998. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. The development officer declared the application incomplete and declared it to be in need of certiorari, a declaration that the application is in fact complete, and an order of mandamus directing the development officer to issue the final approval. Land developer sought relief under s. 250(3) of the Municipal Government Act (MAGTA) for an error in law or lack of appropriate deference to the applicant. HELD: The application was set aside. 1)It was significant that the right of appeal is from a refusal. Technically in the case at bar, the application was not refused it was simply declared incomplete. This was significant in light of s. 277 of the Act. The Municipality relied upon s. 278 of the MGI Act in its submission that the higher road standard represented a major obstacle for the Applicant. 2)The applicant was entitled to a declaration of the application for final subdivision plan approval within two years of the date of the approval of the tentative plan. 3)The Municipality had a different interpretation of the MAGTA s. 283(1), (2)(f) and (g) which provide that an application for subdivision approval is granted if the proposed subdivision is in accordance with the enactments in effect at the time complete application is received. The second requirement appears to be inconsequential."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation was amalgamated with the defendant corporation and held itself out as an energy efficiency consultant. The defendant entered into a letter agreement whereby the defendant agreed to pay 50% of the energy savings enjoyed for a period of sixty months, provided such savings were the result of whatever of the defendant's recommendations were approved by and implemented by the plaintiff. The plaintiff opposed the agreement and brought a motion to stay the action on the basis of forum non conveniens. In this action, the defendant claimed damages for three Hundred and Ninety Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for failing to file a defence in Nova Scotia and the plaintiff sought and was granted leave to tender an Affidavit. The court found that there were a number of triable issues and that the defendant had failed to establish any reasonable excuse for its failure to defend. Dismissing the application, that the default judgment is premature. It was obtained before the time limit for making an appearance had expired. In so doing, the delay was unacceptable to the plaintiff which was loath to relinquish its default judgment without first securing a promise from the defendant that it would either forthwith file defence or if so advised, apply for a stay."
5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issue of divorce, custody and access was disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. HELD: 1) The respondent owned one-quarter of the estate land and it is agreed that his share is matrimonial property. Therefore, the Court declined to order any spousal support. 2) The Court was satisfied on the evidence this debt still exists and that the respondent owes and must pay the sum of $25,812.50 from his interest in the estate. The Court did not find any evidence as to the value of any of the farm equipment but found that it was owned equally by the respondent and the mother. 3) The appraised contributory yard site for the NW 1/4 of 19-20-5-W3 was valued at $96,600. However, the petitioner was awarded judgment against the respondent for the sum less $15,580.00 leaving a balance of $97,575.19 to be paid to the petitioner, less one-half the costs of the appraisals. The judgment shall be a charge on the respondent's personal land. 4) The court found that the average capital cost on land and buildings should not be added back for purposes of determining respondent's income and for the purpose of the Guidelines. The amount of the loan secured by the van now in the possession of the petitioner is $1,000 less than the amount remaining unpaid. 5) The petitioner's income was fixed at $11,376.00 per year. The respondent was responsible for $100 per week of day care and $400 per month of play school. The petitioner earned approximately $200 per month in tips and the respondent was to pay one half of the cost of extra-curricular activities as set forth on Exhibits P-9, P-10 and P-ll. The court was satisfied the respondent had the means to pay Spousal Support."
4_2005skqb542.txt,"The Government seeks an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the plaintiff to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and pursuant to Rule 173 of the Rules and order striking portions of the pleadings. HELD: 1) The plaintiff has failed to identify the legislative scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for education of a group of people that included the plaintiff, was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government. The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government seeks an order requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars in order for it to properly defend the action and not be taken by surprise. The plaintiff cites samples of cases involving similar open ended phrases and submits that such wording is common and should be permitted by the courts. The conduct of examinations for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit the plaintiff to properly defended the action. HELD: 1) The pleadings do not fulfill the requirements of Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. There is no allegation in the appellants' pleadings that the Government acted in its own self-interest and against the interests of either party. Although there is a passing reference to a'responsibility for education of a group of people that included the plaintiff', the claim for 'punitive and exemplary damages' is redundant.  2) In circumstances where the plaintiff has no particulars, he must provide particulars of same. The response that the particulars demanded are 'within the knowledge and peruse[sic] of the Defendant and as such, the Plaintiff is not obliged to provide further particulars'. The decision was reserved pending the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada. 3) The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statutes and regulations on which he relies, he is required to provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes or regulations on hand he must so state them. 4) The plaintiff relies on Odger's Principles of Pleading in Civil Actions in the High Court of Justice, 22nd Ed. (London, 1981) where the test to be followed in determining whether particulars are appropriate is set out at page 155. 5) The conduct evinces a breach of trust, with the attendant emphasis on disloyalty and promotion of one's own or others' interests at the expense of the beneficiary's interests. The defendant knew or ought to have known, and was, or should have been, conscious of the probable consequences of its actions and the damages such actions would cause to the plaintiff."
