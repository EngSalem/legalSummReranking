Allowing the application, that although the wife upgraded her education during the marriage with encouragement and financial support from the husband, she was entitled to maintenance for an indefinite period. The court reviewed the means and needs of the parties and awarded spousal in addition to child maintenance. The court recognized the indirect financial consequences to a custodial parent in raising children.","The wife sought a divorce, as well as maintenance for herself and the five-year-old daughter of the marriage. The parties had been married 10 years, and had been together for 10 years. The wife sought to have the Separation Agreement and Minutes of Settlement incorporated into a Corollary Relief Judgment so far as the jurisdiction of the court permits. The husband did not oppose the divorce, nor did he deny his responsibility to provide financial support for his daughter. The mother, who had accompanied the husband to various places in the Middle East and Brazil, did not take into consideration the amount of tax payable by the husband on the basis of her income. HELD: 1)The separation agreement was not in issue. 2)The mother was to bear the costs of the child's care. 3)The respondent was to pay the child support of $1,500 monthly for an indefinite period of time. 4)The wife had no income and the child was not to work outside the home.  5)The parties entered into an agreement whereby the respondent would bear the net cost of child care to the wife. 6)The petitioner was to have her income divided among the parties according to their means. 7)The support deadline should not be placed upon the wife when she has the direct responsibility of raising the child and when the availability of more gainful employment within the foreseeable future is uncertain. 8)Costs in the sum of $2,234 were entered into the separation agreement."
1994canlii4796.txt,"The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act. 2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy. The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused. 3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan. 4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer. In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan. There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension.","The applicant sought a declaration under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act that her interest in a group registered retirement savings plan (later defined as the ""Group Plan"") was not subject to a security interest she granted to Crown Life. She further sought an order restraining Crown Life from arbitrarily cancelling her participation in the Group Plan. HELD: The application for a restraining order was denied. 1)The provisions of s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act do not apply to the applicant. The taking of security interest by way of a loan agreement contravenes s. 146(3) and s.168 of the PPSA. 2)The applicant had not retired and there appeared to be no evidence of her having received a pension or any other benefit from the plan. The provision regarding an attachable pension refund did not apply. The applicant's request for a direct transfer did not comply with s.7.03 as the provisions of the plan had not been made by her. 3)Since Ms. Corscadden has not retired the plan will be amended to allow the value of her account, less the market value adjustment to be transferred to another depository in accordance with s 146(1) of that Act. 4)The loan agreement contains no provision enabling Crown Life to collapse the applicant's account in the group plan and thereby create a attachable a pension refund. If it did, such provision would violate s.147(12) and (13)of the Income tax Act. 5)The application for restraining order is denied. 6)The provision in s.60 of the PSA which gives the respondent a credit union, a corporation or a private company, with the proceeds of the account to be used to purchase a qualifying annuity or transfer to a registered retirement income fund (RRIF) authorized by the tax court. 7)Nothing in the Plan Contract or the IncomeTax Act prohibits the applicant from setting off her indebtedness to it against any monetary sum due from it. Since the applicant has not Retrievers under her employment and no pension refund exists, there appears to be a prima facie basis for the proposal to have the applicant transferred to the RRIF such as a pension from a previous employer or an employee association to be administered by Crown Life pursuant to s146(3)(c) of this Act. 8)The only exceptions to this prohibition are that the applicant must complete her employment before the date of her termination and that the provision prohibiting the taking of a"

The City applied for a review. HELD: The City's application was allowed. Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question. Pursuant to section 72 of the Act, therefore, these particular terms of the collective agreement applied since they were, when considered in light of the balance of the agreement, more favorable to the employee than the requirements of the Act.","The City applied to have the Director of the Labour Standards Branch of the Department of Labour issued a certificate pursuant to s. 60 of The Labour Standards Act declaring that the City of Regina (the 'City') owed its transit employee $511.08 in wages. The Director filed a letter reducing the assessment to $318.41 (including annual holiday pay). The City brought this application to review the validity of s. 10(1) and 6(2) of the Act which held that an employer is required to pay an employee at the rate of time and one-half for every hour worked in excess of 32 hours in any week containing a public holiday(holiday) or for hours worked over 32 in a week which have a holiday in it. At the hearing, the Director argued that from April 1990 to January 1994 there were five weeks in which the employee worked 40 hours but was not paid overtime for the eight excess hours. The City filed various documents, including copies of the collective bargaining agreement it has with the Amalgamated Transit Union, which covers the employee's employment with the City, and asked me to compare the agreement's holiday pay with the Act's.

1996canlii6881.txt,"FIAT. The parties were divorced in 1995 and all issues including spousal maintenance were left in abeyance. The petitioner had agreed to pay $3,000 per month which included child support but the support was reduced to $1,000 and was irregular and late. The two children were living with the petitioner and although old enough to hold jobs, had been unable to find employment. The petitioner's income exceeded $80,000 annually but he had been suspended with pay and the status of his employment was uncertain. HELD: 1)It was premature to fix the amount of spousal maintenance as asked for by the applicant. There were too many unknowns including the future of the petitioner's future job and income and how much the applicant would require should she go to university in the fall and what the children would do about future education. 2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the maintenance. 3)The petitioner was directed to pay $1,500 plus $200.00 per month until the shortfall was paid in full.  4)The applicant was awarded costs of the application.","FIAT. The parties separated in the summer of 1994. All other issues raised in the divorce proceeding were left in abeyance including the issue of spousal maintenance. The husband had reduced the monthly support to $1,000 for the months of September through December 1995. Since then the wife had received only $3,000. The petitioner had unilaterally reduced the amount of monthly support down to $500. Since the December 1995 divorce order, all other issues had been left in the husband's favour. He asked the wife to reconsider her employment. She refused. HELD: 1)The application was premature. There were too many unknown factors surrounding the future situation of either party to conclude that what the applicant asks for is fair and reasonable. There was uncertainty as to what the husband might require if he does go to a university this fall. 2)The husband's income exceeded $80,000 annually. He had the two children living with him. He was working and living with the wife. The matrimonial home had been sold and it was expected that each party would receive approximately $30,000 in early June when the net proceeds were distributed. 3)The wife had been paid $3000.00 per month in support of their two children. However, since the husband had been suspended with pay, the wife's monthly support had been reduced to $600.00 for the month of September and December. 4)Since the husband was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the monthly maintenance he had consistently paid up to December 1995 to just under $1 per month without consulting the wife and without requiring her to pay any of the above-mentioned costs. 5)The court was of the opinion that the petitioner was entitled to any portion of the unpaid maintenance she had received in the past without consulting with the applicant."
1997canlii787.txt,"After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, the plaintiff, a supplier of materials to the sub-contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub-contractor. The Bond contained a provision limiting the liability of the surety and the principal to make payment to any claimant not having a contract directly with the principal. Dismissing the action with costs, that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier. With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work. As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff. Therefore, the supplier was not entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond.","After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, a supplier of materials to the subcontractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a Labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub contractor. The contract stipulated that if the mechanics' lien act had applied, the contractor would have been obliged to recover against it the money owing from the subcontractors. In the absence of a mechanical lien, the supplier would not have been entitled to recover anything due to the third party statutory liens. HELD: The claims of the plaintiff and London Guarantee were dismissed. 1)The Mechanics' Lien Act does not expressly state that it binds the Crown. However, the amount of the lien fund available to subcontractors if the Mechanics'Lien Act had applied could have been less than the amount demanded by Revenue Canada and Labour Standards as against the contractor. If the Act applied, Rideau Construction would be required to retain the holdback established by the Act: Construction Builders' and Mechanics' Liens in Canada, Vol. 2, pp.4-13. 2)The only authority cited with respect to the purpose and effect of Clause 4(4) of the Bond is Johnson Controls Ltd. et al. (1996), 157 N.S.R. (2d) 350 (S.C.A.D.) which considered a provision of a Bond identical to that considered in the present case was Davison, J.L. held that there was no authority, therefore costs should not be awarded against it. 3)The letter submitted by the plaintiff that the letter contained no words of explicit promise to pay and contained no mention of any payment to any claimant not having a contract directly with the principal and that, since those third party claims total an amount greater than that of the amount in question, potential lien claimants such as Hazmasters would not be entitled to recovery any amount from it. 4)The plaintiff's claim against the defendant for breach of contract and breach of terms of the contract were both dismissed."
1999canlii12427.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching contrary to s.271(1) and 153 of the Criminal Code. The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor. The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused often slept on the couch in the basement of the house adjacent to the room where the family watched TV. There was a couch or love seat in the living room adjacent to where the children often stayed up at least until midnight. The accused frequently came up to the complainant and touched her legs and breasts. She told her mother that he had touched her buttocks once when she was in the shower. She said that this happened several times. She also said that he sometimes touched her breasts and that once he tripped over her younger sister who was lying on the floor. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. 1)There was no evidence of sexual assault beyond the reasonable doubt of a reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt or innocence. Although the accused had an opportunity, he did not have it in him to repeat the offence so many times and have the audacity to repeat it again and again. He did have an opportunity but he failed to take it seriously and told the complainant that he would be out on the street if it ever happened again. 2)His explanations for the behaviour of his accusers and the absence of complaint by the complainant were not supported by expert testimony. The only evidence that would have confirmed his evidence was that he was severely drunk and had to be re-examined. 3)His behaviour was not like the other accused's. It was more like his usual pattern of intrusive behaviour that was characteristic of the sexual predators. He was drunk and often drunk. He touched his inappropriately and touched his privates, breasts and vaginal area as well as his penis. He brushed his fingers over the complainant's legs and sometimes hung himself on the wall in front of her so that he could get a grip on her when he was drunk. 4)The absence of a complaint would have been very helpful to the court. An expert in adolescent behaviour could have been of great assistance. 5)Although there was no reasonable doubt the accused was guilty of all of the offences, there was plenty of circumstantial evidence surrounding his behaviour and the fact that he is a 'grooming' sexual predator. The Court was entitled to take judicial notice of this."

She raised s.9 and 8 of the Charter in objecting to the arrest and seizure of the duffel bag. The voir dire occupied 5 days. HELD: 1)The four requirements set out in R. v. Feeney for a warrantless search were satisfied. The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the duffel bag was incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. 2)The accused had no expectation of privacy with respect to either her friend's residence or the bag. The decision in R. v. Edwards was squarely on point. There was no evidence tying the accused to the gym bag. It was of a different description than the one used in the drugstore robbery. The accused never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it. The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence. 3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter. To exclude the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused objected to her arrest and to the seizure of a duffel bag containing a quantity of narcotics. The police conducted a voir dire as result at the opening of the trial. A great deal of evidence was presented, the majority of which was elicited in very detailed and extended cross-examination. The accused also called evidence on the voirs dire but did not testify. HELD: The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the bag were incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. Pursuant to s. 9 and 8 of the Charter the police need not demonstrate anything more than reasonable and probable grounds in order to establish a prima facie case for conviction. If there were any violations of the accused's rights under the Charter, the police would be entitled to search an arrested person for a weapon if under the circumstances it seemed reasonable to check whether the person might be armed.

At some point during the proposal Mr. White defaulted and defaulted. The proposal was deemed to be annulled. PWC paid a trustee's fee but that fee could only be adjusted based on those amounts received by PWC under the provisions of the consumer proposal. The trustee objected on this taxation indicating that this court should review the trustee's fees given that the trustee accepted payments after the deemed annulment. HELD: The fee was taxed and allowed in the appropriate amount and the excess monies should be distributed to the creditor's who should be advised that their original debts remain receivable. 1)The court had no discretion in the trustee or court to relieve against the annulation. 2)PWC should only be based on monies received from the debtor while the proposal was extant. The fee is taxed and permitted in the amount of $5 with leave to reapply to me to set a specific number if PWC and the Superintendent cannot agree what that should be. 3)The debtor did send those monies to PWC with the intention their monies be awarded to the debtor's creditors.

There was a request by the defendants' counsel to have the matter addressed by way of costs.  2) Given Tapp's representation as to the amount of stress that he was presently under, it was not appropriate in the circumstances to assess costs against the plaintiff over his conduct of the counsel and against the defendant's counsel in the ongoing action. Accordingly, the matter was left to the trial court to determine the appropriate course of action. 3) Because the plaintiffs' counsel was under extreme pressure and stress lately with respect to this file and others, he had prepared three motions fairly similar to one another.

Ace had been subpoenaed and had been sitting in the Court listening to other Crown witnesses. Defence counsel objected and claimed the Crown had not disclosed this witness. Ace was also a client of defence counsel and so defence counsel would not be able to cross-examine Ace. HELD: The Crown failed to provide proper disclosure to defence counsel, the non-disclosure had an adverse effect of the accused's ability to make full answer in defence and the appropriate remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call Ace as a witness.","The accused was charged with break and enters of homes and was denied involvement. After hearing evidence from the home owners, co-accused and peace officers who investigated the incidents, the Crown advised the court of its intention to call one Ace Carlos Whitecap to the witness box. Defence counsel objected on this basis, arguing that the Crown had ambushed him and his client and that they should not be permitted to do so. At the very least, another lawyer would have had to sit through the entire Crown case in order to be as effective as possible in the cross-examination of this witness. HELD: The accused's right to full answer and defence has been prejudiced only by not being told that Ace CarlosWhitecap would be a Crown witness. 1) The Crown's failure to disclose its intention in disclosing its non-disclosure has prejudiced or had an adverse effect on the accused's ability to make full answer/defence. 2) There was no evidence of the defence's pre-arranged exclusion of the accused from calling the witness. The defence had met the test of not being informed that the accused would be called. The accused was disadvantaged in that the defence would not be able to cross-examine the witness effectively and at all. 3) The Court refused to allow the Crown to call this witness, finding that the stay of proceedings was out of the question. The court could have made arrangements for another lawyer to step in to cross examine the witness but that would not have been an appropriate remedy. The Crown should have disclosed their intention in the disclosure provided to the defence. 4) The respondent was disadvantaged by the fact that he was not only a client of the Crown but his name was mentioned in a disclosure given to defence. The respondent's privilege was not breached. 5) The court was unable to say the defence was advantaged by the Crown's exclusion of a potential witness. A potential witness may well be a witness for the defence but not a potential Crown witness and the respondent's exclusion from the disclosure gave the defence a chance to prepare their own defence. 6) The judge was satisfied that the respondent had not been advantaged or advantaged against the accused in that he did not know the potential witness and therefore should have been excluded.

2005nssc364.txt,"The Agency applied for permanent care of a young child, with no access to the parents. Each of the mother, the biological father and the psychological father sought to have the child placed in their care. The child had been apprehended due to unsafe and unhealthy living conditions. The mother and psychological father no longer lived together and for the past few months, the mother had been maintaining a clean and tidy apartment and attempting to improve her education and had taken parenting courses. The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child. The mother was against this plan. The biological father only reappeared on the scene after the child was taken into care and acknowledged that the child did not know him as her father. Child placed in the permanent care of the Agency with no access to the mother or the psychological father; access ordered to the biological father for a period of six months at which time the access order will expire automatically unless an application to vary is made; the Agency is to arrange for a parental capacity assessment of the biological father. The child continued to be at substantial risk of physical harm due to neglect if she was returned to the mother's care and the child would be at risk of exposure to violence if returned to the psychological father's care due to the tumultuous relationship between the mother and him. Although some improvements had recently been made in the mother's life, she had a history of frequent changes of residence and did not appear able put the child's needs ahead of her own. The Agency had not had an opportunity to assess the appropriateness of a placement with the biological father.","The agency applied for an order of permanent care and custody with no provision for access to the child. The mother opposed the application and requested an order returning the child to her care. The biological father who had minimal contact with the child was added as a party to the order. The Agency alleged that the child had been placed in the care of the psychological father because of instability in the home, the risk of physical harm caused by the mother and psychological father's failure to supervise the child, and that there was a risk of the child suffering harm as a result of the abuse. The psychological father was considered parent or guardian pursuant to s. 36(1)(b) and 3(1) of s. 45 for the purposes of protection finding. Testimony was received from the mother, child protection worker, the biological father, the mother's sister and a psychologist. HELD: 1) The burden of proof in proceeding such as this is clearly on the Agency. It is a civil burden that must have regard to the seriousness of the consequences of the decision. 2) The child was apprehended in April 2004 because of unsafe and unhealthy living conditions. The apartment was in disarray and the mother was living alone. The parties did not cooperate in addressing the risk factors that affected the child's health and safety. 3) There was insufficient evidence to determine the extent to which the respondent's actions were in breach of the provisions of the Act. It was unnecessary to ask the court to return the child who had been removed from her care and who had not been apprehended by the Agency prior to that date. 4) Counsel for the Agency was not able to represent the respondent.

The Crown will make timely disclosure of: (a) the number of stops made by the RCMP in each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004; (b) the reason for each stop in the first place; (c) how many of those stops resulted in search for contraband, including narcotics; (d) Specifics of any other grounds for searches that were applied and how many times; (e) On how many occasions did the searches result in the finding of contraband; and (f) the actual notes of the RCMP officer. HELD: The Crown shall make timely and extensive authorities. The notes will presumably supply some details of the required disclosure as ordered above and as usual will be made available for the purposes of evidence at trial if required and shown to be relevant to the proceedings as they unfold."
2006nssc139.txt,"The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage. The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment. The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child. The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home. Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity. The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","The wife commenced divorce proceedings in November 2004.She sought custody, access, child support, spousal support and costs with a division of property in accordance with the Separation Agreement entered into between her and the husband in August 2004. The husband sought a variation of the provisions regarding child support and child support. It was his position that the particulars of the agreement did not and do not now reflect his net business income derived from self employment. He sought an increase in access. The mother argued the husband had failed to negotiate a mobility restriction clause which he assumed would protect his interests. HELD: 1) The Separation agreement was entered into to assure that his child would not be removed from his home town and that he was prepared to give her his equity in the home and possessions and guarantee her enough money per month to ensure she remained in the matrimonial home with his son. 2) The agreement clearly favours the mother. The father agreed to the terms of their agreement but did not ensure he was fully protected by overtly addressing mobility. There was no evidence of undue influence, fraud or evidence that would affect the ability to retain and instruct counsel. There were no significant changes in the circumstances of the parties. 3) The parties had the opportunity to consult with independent counsel. The petitioner had no reason to believe that mobility would become an issue at some point. The paternal grandparents had similar interests in keeping the mother and her child in the jurisdiction. 4) The respondent failed to reach an agreement that allowed him to significantly increase the child support he was entitled to in the amount of $1,600 per month for two years. The respondent was granted one-half of the sum originally received by the petitioner and one-third of the amount actually paid by the respondent. 5) The petitioner did not establish that there was an implicit threat that she would leave the jurisdiction with the child unless the terms were satisfactory to her. The court could not intervene at this time."
2006skqb382.txt,"The petitioner seeks child and spousal support. The parties signed a separation agreement and interspousal contract in July 2004. With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1) The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum. The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'. This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support. The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist. 2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program. Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year. The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006. It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000. Child support will be ordered based on $53,000 on an interim basis.","The petitioner sought child support and spousal support pending trial. The parties signed a separation agreement and interspousal contract in July 2004. The agreement provides that the respondent shall pay one half of the net income to the petitioner by way of equal monthly payments of support. The amount of payment shall be adjusted yearly to reflect the changing income of the parties. The respondent has no resources to pay back any interim support received. The petitioner seeks to set aside the settlement agreement on the grounds of undue influence and duress or alternatively that the agreement was unfair and unconscionable. HELD: 1)The agreement stipulated that the petitioner's gross income should not be extrapolated from the amount of child support payable in the event of a material change in circumstances. This was not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim support.  2)The petitioner was entitled to support under the agreement and the circumstances as they presently existed. She would proceed to pre-trial conference and trial if necessary on the question of whether the respondent is obliged to pursue work in his field as a computer consultant. 3)The parties had signed a comprehensive agreement which dealt with parenting issues, child support, and the division of family property. The sole source of revenue was revenue earned by the respondent's efforts as computer consultant in 2005. In 2006 the respondent earned income of $125,000. In 2007 the respondent was employed with an annual salary of $100,000 and received severance packages of $74,038. 4)The respondent's income was $53,000 less the actual expenses incurred to earn that income. The actual amount of the expenses were somewhat more or somewhat less than the actual amount. 5)There were no circumstances in which the petitioner sought to vary the respondent’s s. 7.3 and 7.5(f) contract in which it was assumed that he would earn $65,000 per annum while attending the program.  6)Costs remained at the table."
2007skqb376.txt,"The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated. The application is dismissed.","In dealing with the first application, the petitioner sought to vary the child support order granted by the court in 2005 by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. The respondent argued that there had been a clear declaration in two separate writings of the oldest child's desire to have primary residence change from her father to her mother. Further, there was some evidence that the younger child wished to also live with her mother or, at the least, live in the same residence as her older sister. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)As no material change has been demonstrated, this application must be dismissed. 2)There is no evidence that there has been a material change demonstrated. The children were born, have grown up, and continue to live, go to school and have friends in Nipawin. There is no information before the court to suggest that this is no longer in the best interests of these children. 3)The test for variation has been set out in cases such as Talbot v. Henry (1990), 151 Sask. R. 168 (Sask. Q.B.)Gerein J. succinctly states the current approach of the Court to the 'wishes of the children' issue: a two-stage inquiry. The court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There was a strong indication that at the time the decision was made in 2005, the child had expressed a desire to try living with her. She now expresses this desire in stronger terms but it is not change. 4)No material change was demonstrated in the application by the petitioner for change in child support. The mother in her affidavit material confirms that she has commenced as of June 2007 to pay support based on her new income and as there is agreement between the parties, each from their own affidavit material, that that current support level should be $619 per month. The order shall be varied to reflect the gross annual income of the respondent, Susan."
2009skqb36.txt,"FIAT: This is an application to determine interim parenting for the child, Kaira, who is 2.5 years old. There is conflicting information about the nature and extent of the petitioner father's parenting duties. The respondent has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child go with her. The petitioner would like Kaira to remain in Saskatchewan and have regular contact with each parent on alternating weeks. HELD: 1) The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The Court cannot determine on conflicting affidavits what the primary parent status quo is. 2) It is in the best interest that the child see both parents. There was a similar course in Saskatoon that the respondent could have taken which would have made more frequent changes possible, but her affidavit indicates she thinks the Saskatoon course is inferior to the one she is taking in Victoria. 3) Pending trial the child shall be parented by the petitioner for 28 days, and thereafter by the respondent for 28 days and such parenting shall continue to alternate for each 28 day period thereafter until further order. The costs of transportation shall be born primarily by the respondent.","FIAT: This is an application to determine interim parenting for the child. There is conflicting affidavit evidence respecting the nature and extent of the father's parenting duties while the parties lived together. The mother, Lesly, has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child with her. The issues of parenting and mobility are clearly unresolved and may go to trial. HELD: 1) The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The primary parent status quo is Lesly. Lesly has chosen not to take school in Victoria but that does not mean that even if Lesly is theprimary parent that the child will continue to live in Regina or that she will have regular contact with each parent alternating each week. However it is fair that Mike contribute something to this cost. 2) Costs in the cause are to be determined by reference to Gordon v. Goertz (1996), 141 Sask. R. 241; 134 D.L.R. (4th) 321. Both Shiplack, supra and Stomp, supra are instructive re these kind of cases. There was no compelling reason to allow mobility in the case merely because the mother has made some unilateral decisions about her education. It was not possible for the petitioner to determine on conflicting affidavits what the primary parental status quo was. 3) Lesly's support network is in Regina and not in Victoria."
2009skqb445.txt,"The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances. The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1) There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence. In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos. The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","The accused is facing a 24 count indictment generally associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances and matters ancillary thereto. This motion, under s.7, 11(d) and 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, is for an order that the accused be provided with full disclosure in useable format. The issues are whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided; and whether the format of disclosure was appropriate. HELD: 1) The accused is entitled to hard copies of all documents filed by the defence. Given the nature of the organization of the data by the Crown, the cost of obtaining the police officers' notebooks in full, in chronological order for pre-trial examination and trial cross-examination is significant. However, the day will come when the ability to operate personal computers and retrieve data stored on computer disks and related media by means of software programs designed for general public use will be core competency requirement for counsel who wish to act in cases involving voluminous amounts of data. It appears that that day has come. The disclosure provided to date has been reasonably accessible and in a reasonably accessible manner. It is appropriate to embark upon a Laporte inquiry and make the appropriate order, if any, regarding further disclosure. 2) There is no need for the Crown to provide copies of any officer's notebooks in hard copy and chronological order that postdates the laying of the charges or the issuance of search warrants, whichever is dated later. In this case, the nature and format of the disclosure provided is appropriate. The notes of those officers who provided information for the issuanceof the search warrants have to be provided to the defence in a hard copy in order to level the playing field. What is not easily available and not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed in the affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence’s argument. 3) The notebook format is appropriate in that it is not hard copy, but rather an accessible format. In all other respects, it was appropriate to provide some basic information regarding the nature, format and disclosure provided so far. For the first time, the notebook format of a civilian member of the RCMP (RCMP) whose function was to assemble files for disclosure purposes has been reviewed and approved by the Court. The Court reviewed R. v. Piaskowski and found that, in some cases, the disclosure should be provided in a manner that is reasonably accessible by the"
2009skqb506.txt,"The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession. The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person. The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","The landlord appealed a decision of the hearing officer of the Residential Tenancies Office. The hearing officer found that she did not have the jurisdiction to deal with the matter and the tenant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the notice to vacate was served on the tenant by the landlord. The landlord had attempted to sell the property for several years. The tenant had signed a 3-year lease in good faith and believed that the landlord, Koch, was the sole owner of the property. Koch's son had rented out a portion of the house to the tenant and given a 3 year lease. When he signed the lease, he did not know that there was a second tenant living in the premises. He thought that Koch was the landlord's son and that he was acting for his mother. The Hearing Officer found that although Koch and the landlord had a valid tenancy agreement, the landlord and tenant had not entered a written one. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The tenancy agreement was not valid. 2)The hearing officer did not err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 3)The tenants had entered into a written tenancy agreement for the purpose of allowing the landlord to terminate the tenancy. 4)The Hearing Officer made an error in law by failing to properly serve the notice. 5)Section 70 of The residential Tenancies Act provides for an order respecting any tenancy agreement. The Act applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. Section 7(f) of the Act applies. 6)The tenant's obligation to pay rent is suspended if the landlord makes an order for possession of the rental unit pursuant to s.7(f)(i). 7)To create a fixed term tenancy of three months or longer a landlord-tenant relationship, landlord- tenant agreement, or any other means of transportation, the tenant may enter into written tenancy agreements. 8)Section 8 of the Charter provides for a hearing officer to inquire into the circumstances of a tenancy agreement or to determine if there has been any breach of the tenants' rights under the Charter. 9)Section 19 of the Code provides for the appointment of a Hearing Officer with the sole purpose of determining the jurisdiction of the Hearing Officer in relation to any hearing officer within 30 days of the date of hearing. A hearing officer shall make a determination on the basis of estoppel, common law or operation of the principles of law.  10)A hearing officer may make an order"
2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the respondent was not a person with a sufficient interest. It would not elevate him above the category of persons having a'sufficient interest' under the Act. Because the respondent had not established himself as a person of sufficient interest within the meaning of s.2 of the Act, the court dismissed the application. The respondent did not need to establish that he was the person with sufficient interest to bring this application. Because of the familial relationship among the respondent and the fact that he lived with her mother for several years, it would appear that their relationship spanned the years 2000 to 2007 when the petitioner was barely a toddler. Over the span of that time, the respondent provided care for the child and provided child care when the parties lived together. The petitioner now lives in a household with the third man, whom she refers to as her father. HELD: 1) The respondent was found not to have sufficient interest in the application as he did not establish himself in the circumstances described by the petitioner. He was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment to be served in the community. The conditions attached to the community based sentence did not prohibit him from having contact with the child. 2) There was no evidence that the petitioner had any financial support from the respondent. It was clear from the outset that the relationship with the respondent that she had with her two half-siblings was one of the factors to determine whether access should be granted to him. The evidence showed that he had a close 'child-parent relationship' with the petitioner while he and Melodie lived together and that he stood in the place of parent to her. The relationship had spanned some time between the petitioner's two younger half- siblings (who had moved in with her at the time of the separation) and they were involved in many extracurricular activities. 3) Access was denied."
2011nssc455.txt,"The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The charges relate to events which occurred between April 8 and April 14, 2010 respectively. The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases: to allow three separate trials in all; and to separate for trial all of the so-called status offences. The only possible link conceded is the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the gun on both days. In the final analysis, the Court would be better served to order the accused to testify on one or more of the counts rather than on all of them."
2_1999canlii12669.txt,"The respondent seeks an order for interim spousal support. The parties were married in January 1991 with three children and ceased to cohabit in December of 1996. The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT. The respondent sought an order for interim spousal support. HELD: The Court concluded that relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should not take the form of maintenance. The Part D pension income of the respondent was $580 per month and the matrimonial home was $293,874. The difference in value relates to a section of land which the respondent brought into the marriage. The petitioner's share of the 1998 crop has value of $16,000. The fact that the petitioner is an incomplete quadriplegic means that she is in the position of not being able to obtain suitable shelter on her own. The latter can be achieved by providing the respondent with some of the income earned from his land. The Court ordered the respondent to pay $500 per month. In addition, the Federal Child Support Guidelines would stipulate a payment of $442.00 a month. The CP pension income, including G.S.T. credit, was to be paid by monthly payments in the amount of $500. The balance of $6,000 should be paid to the respondent by monthly dividend payments of $1,111.67 if he is required to pay out an additional $500 month. On the whole the respondent's annual income of $23,560.00 is being provided for. There is no requirement that the respondent live in a group home and there is no basis upon which he can order or even expect such. As for the payments on a bank loan obtained to purchase an RRSP, the transaction was appropriate, but it must be remembered that there is an off-setting asset which could be sold and reduced loan payments would result. The monthly expense of $5,000 for legal fees is meaningless. Finally, small economics could be achieved."
2_2010skpc149.txt,"The accused were both charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault. The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.","The two accused were charged on separate informations with assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and with wilfully damaging the windows of a car. HELD: The accused were found not guilty of the first count on information 24414281.  1) The physical altercation in this case was precipitated by jealousy or by a drug deal gone bad. There is no doubt that the accused were the aggressors throughout. He smashed in one, if not two, car windows. He chased after the complainant with Dagenais' help. Once at the trailer he rushed up the stairs toward the complainant. This was threatening behaviour and the complainant said he felt threatened. 2) The accused admitted to hitting the complainant three times in the face. He admitted to breaking the front passenger window of the car and breaking the rear window. 3) The Court found that both accused were justified in using force to defend themselves or any one under protection from assault if he used no more force than is necessary to prevent the assault or the repetition of it. The Court also found that the second count was justified because the complainant choked him at one point during the fight.  4) There was no evidence of any essential element of the offence. The accused testified that they got into a fistfight in the parking lot of a strip mall. The complainant was sitting in the driver's seat when the altercation took place. He was on top of the complainant when he said that he 'felt threatened.'  5) The complainant's injuries would have been far more severe if the altercation had actually occurred and he was not there to apologize."
2_2010skqb402.txt,"The defendant applied for dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution. The claim was issued November 1, 1999 and is based in debt for goods and services provided to the defendant. The value of the claim is $521,283.99 and refers to provision of materials, products and services in 1995 and 1996. The statement of defence was filed November 12, 1999 and amended in 2002. In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary. A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48. In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided. Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference. There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case. The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short. While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance. Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial. The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action. The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied.","The respondent applies for the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The respondent responds through its counsel that it now has every intention to diligently proceed with its action. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's delay in advancing the cause was inordinate and legally inexcusable. However, the plaintiff was also responsible for the payment by Ochapowace to McDiarmid of $100,000. The indebtedness claimed owing is $521,283.89. 2) It is in the interests of justice that the plaintiff be permitted to pursue its claim. All parties are cautioned to now proceed diligently and without delay. Failure to do so will no doubt cause the defendant to consider making a further application for dismissal. 3) The application for an order returning the $40,000 paid by the respondent to Mcdiarmid is not a relief which can be granted at this time. The question of whether or not settlement was reached, the circumstances under which this payment was made were live issues raised by the pleadings. This is an issue that must be determined by the trial judge.  4) The Court reviewed all the relevant facts, which it considered appropriate to the Carey case approach, and noted that no legally acceptable excuses had been advanced for the inordinate delay. 5) It was in the interest of justice to grant the plaintiff its costs on a party/party basis notwithstanding the costs that may ultimately be ordered in the cause."
2_2011nssc486.txt,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","This was a divorce proceeding and the parties were in a shared parenting regime. The mother sought custody and primary care of the children, while the father was a regular user of marijuana and alcohol. The father felt that since he was paying a proportionally greater share of the day to day care expenses, the mother would have no reason to develop a better relationship with him. Therefore, the information provided by the father and his witnesses was credible. The court found that the evidence indicated that the children needed counseling because of anything their Father had done. Counsel for the children was credible and the evidence did not support any suggestion that joint custody or shared parenting would be appropriate. However, the evidence from the mother and her witnesses did raise some concerns about the father's ability to meet the children's needs even in the midst of changes in income and circumstance. Counsel was to advise the parties on the best way to proceed with the parenting arrangements they had developed. There was no presumption in favour of reducing the child support obligation downward from the Guidelines amount."
2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused was convicted of assaulting a peace officer. HELD: The Court found that given the serious nature of the offence, which included 58 Criminal Code convictions, and the fact that the accused had been cornered by two police officers, there was no attempt to try and strike either officer. This offence was a'serious personal injury offence' as defined by the Criminal Code and the accused's actions included the use of violence. The offence is a serious personal injury offense as defined in s.752. The threshold is low as the accused was sentenced to a maximum penalty of 10 years and the Court must consider whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender might be a dangerous or long-term offender within the realm of possibility or beyond."
3_1995canlii4402.txt,"The respondent expropriated a parcel of land owned by the appellant. Prior to a hearing, all claims for the case were settled for the sum of $20,000. The appellant's solicitor presented solicitor and client accounts of $19,420 plus taxes. The respondent directed taxation, and the appellant's solicitor submitted further accounts for services and disbursements of the taxation hearing amounting to $7,212.24. The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000. He proceeded to tax the account at $14,000, disallowed any costs of the taxation hearing, and disallowed a claim for interest on interim accounts submitted by the solicitor. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal and confirming the taxation, that the taxing master did not make any errors in law. He was entitled to consider as one of the relevant factors the relationship of the total account to the recovery.","The expropriation of land in 1993 by the City Council passed a resolution to expropriate it for the purpose of widening the Bedford Highway. The land was approximately 10 feet of the 30-foot rear yard for retaining wall. The construction of the retaining wall began in February 1994 with the work beginning in June 1994. At the end of the work, the appellant advised the City that it intended to abandon the land retaining only an easement necessary for the footing. City council approved the abandonment in October 1994. The solicitor for the appellant rendered a solicitor-client account to the City in the amount of $19,420 plus taxes representing approximately 100 hours time spent on the file and in a decision dated August 25, 1995 he reduced the account to $14,000 plus taxes. The Taxing Master was correct in declining to award the sum of $5,855 to the appellant. The appellant's appeal was dismissed and the taxation of costs by the taxing master confirmed.  1)The appellant had no liability for any costs associated with the solicitor and client taxation and the fact that the matter was settled did not result in a denial of costs. 2)Taxing officers are not to be interfered with on appeal unless and until it is shown that they fell into error by the exercise of some wrong principle. 3)A judge's fundamental consideration in statutory interpretation is the role of the solicitor. Consideration must be given to both the spirit and letter of the legislation. In this case, the appellants suggest that the City disallowed any services that were actually incurred, but as a result of design changes, was located entirely within the original street width, leaving only the footings protruding into the claimant's property. 4)In a previous case the appellant had made an offer for full compensation for the unpaid legal services rendered by the appellant in regard to the disposal of the respondent's (expropriation) property. 5)The respondent's accountant was taxed by the city for $20,000 and the solicitor's account was taxed at $7,000. 6)It is common practice for almost all commercial accounts to have some reference to interest on overdue balances stated on invoices. The mere statement of an interest term on an invoice by itself raises no legal obligation for payment of such costs. Some of the research should be chalked up to gaining of experience in this specific field of law."
3_1995canlii6053.txt,"The accused was charged with failing to appear at his trial on a charge of impaired driving. The impaired driving charge was subsequently stayed. When the charge of failing to appear came on for trial the accused claimed a 'lawful excuse' for his failure to appear on the impaired driving charge. His excuse was that the next shift at work had failed to arrive on time and that this had made it impossible for him to get to court on time. This excuse was rejected and he was convicted. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Whether an accused has a lawful excuse is determined with reference to common law principles. It normally includes all of the defences which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 2)The Court was unable to say that the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor could it say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.",The accused sought to overturn his conviction for failing to attend court by arguing that the trial judge ought to have accepted his excuse for not appearing. At issue was whether the accused advanced a 'lawful excuse' for not attending court. HELD: The appeal was allowed on appeal. 1)The trial judge rejected the accused's submission that he had a lawful excuse for failure to attend. 2)The Supreme Court of Canada commented on comments made in R. v. Holmes which indicate that a constructive excuse includes all of the defences the common law considers sufficient defences. It can also include excuses specific to particular offences. 3)The accused's feelings were bruised by the fact the original impaired driving charge was stayed by the Crown.
3_1997canlii11217.txt,"Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them. The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996. The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions.","The petitioner brothers were three brothers from the District of Perdue, Saskatchewan who carry on a family farm operation and operate a family-owned farm implement dealership business. In 1985, the accountant for the respondent advised the brothers that they should become involved in certain real estate partnerships in order to derive certain tax advantages. The petitioner, who had recently become a professional hockey player, left the partnership in 1996. Changes in the membership of the partnership occurred by unanimous agreement between the existing members of the Partnerships. In 1996, the Registrar in Bankruptcy granted an ex parte order directing the petitioner to preserve and retain intact and in specie various market securities (the Securities) previously owned by the petitioner and purportedly'seized' by his wife, Susan Ashton pursuant to an alleged security interest granted in her favour by the respondent. In 1997, the petitioner filed notice of disputing petition. The petitioners alleged that the respondent had committed an act of bankruptcy within six months prior to the petitioner's filing.

The father would have access on alternating weekends and for a three hour period one weekday provided the child was returned by the bedtime set by the mother. Although both parents genuinely love the child and were equally competent caregivers, neither demonstrated that sole parenting offered an advantage to him.

The youth was facing a variety of charges including failure to comply with conditions of an undertaking; failure to attend court; possession of property obtained by crime; obstructing a police officer. He requested the Youth Court appoint counsel after his Legal Aid lawyer withdrew. Both parents were on social assistance. The matter was adjourned to investigate the possibility of an aunt providing financial assistance but the youth advised in April that she was unable to do so. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Youth Court judge did not err in refusing to direct counsel be appointed. The Youth Court judge's discretion is not limited solely to considerations of financial inability.

3_2002skca56.txt,"A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users. A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services). The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order. It retained jurisdiction to confirm compliance. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date.","The appellant appeals a decision of the Board of Inquiry appointed by the Minister of Justice under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code which found that the appellant continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services to wheelchair users and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet the accessibility requirements of the National Building Code of Canada 1995. The appellant appeals contending that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order that it did. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order, an order in which it had retained jurisdiction, to confirm compliance with the order and which had been confirmed by this Court. The extent of the order, that is whether it was confined to external access of the property or to other 'facilities and services', whether it had been complied with is the very question the Board reserved jurisdiction to determine.

3_2003canlii64101.txt,"The mother moved for the dismissal of the pending permanent care trial, arguing that, applying the reasoning in a recent Court of Appeal decision, the court had lost jurisdiction. No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties. The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel. Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed. The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial. When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act. When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date.","The child protection proceeding in respect of the child who was under the age of six when taken into care was delayed for a number of reasons. The primary child protection concerns that were advanced by the agency were such that the original agency planning for the reunification of the mother and child required some psychological counselling. Counsel for the mother made a motion that based on the rule in B.F. I had lost my jurisdiction and must dismiss the matter. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)The time limit preceded the disposition order and the trial date is after the outside disposition date provided in the Act. 2)The trial date was near the outside deadline. There was good reason for the matter to be extended for a trial beyond the date of the overall deadline. 3)Apprehension will expose the child to the very delay the deadlines are designed to avoid since each stage of the proceeding (interim hearing, protection finding and at least one disposition hearing) will have to run their course, in the absence of consent to consolidation under s40(2) of the act. 4)The Court had not lost its jurisdiction in this matter and the matter was set to commence tomorrow."

The accused admitted to consuming one vodka cooler before driving but argued the signs of impairment were manifestations of his panic attack. No .08 charge was laid, as his readings were .07 and .06. HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack. The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As stated in McCallum, the fact that the effects of alcohol may have been exacerbated by the accused suffering from fatigue does not provide a defence to the charge.","The accused was charged with having the care or control of a motor vehicle while his ability to operate it was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The accused's evidence which was to the effect that he was suffering from a panic attack, raised a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The accused had been diagnosed as suffering from generalized anxiety disorder (G.A.D.). 2)The symptoms of impairment displayed by the accused were the manifestations of his panic attack not from the consumption of alcohol. 3)The medical evidence did not support the accused's diagnosis of G.A.(D.) or his evidence as to the possibility of him being in such an attack.

His students helped him to the faculty lounge. He was found in the faculty washroom unconscious and not breathing approximately 30 minutes later. Emergency medical technicians were not able to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead at the Royal University Hospital. An application for dependants' benefits was submitted over 3 years later. The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim. The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674. HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption. 2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant. 3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing. 4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis.","The applicant sought an order by way of certiorari pursuant to Rule 664 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court, to quash the decision of the Workers' Compensation Board which denied the applicant's application for benefits based upon its finding that the deceased spouse was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of the Worker's Compensation Act. The applicant had become aware of the potential benefits in early July 2001 during a casual conversation at her workplace and suggested that her husband had been performing work duties while on campus to attend class or to study. The Board denied the application based upon two alternative grounds: the delay in bringing the claim, and the fact that the respondent was not 'found dead at work'. HELD: The application for dependants' benefits was denied. 1)Section 45(1)(b) does not bar the Board's decision from judicial review when the Board exercises its discretion to decide a matter but the legislation did not 'intend to commit the matter exclusively to the Board'. The privative clause determined that the standard of review will generally be one of patent unreasonableness. 2)The respondent Board did not properly apply the presumption contained in s.30 of the Act in favour of the applicant. 3)Section 47 (determining the cause of death of a dependant worker) is not the same as s.45 (imposing conditions on employment). 4)The applicant was not advised by anyone that she and her daughter might have any potential entitlement to receive benefits from the Board as a result of the death of her husband.  5)S.45 is the current wording of the legislation. Section 45 pertains to the statutory six month claims reporting. 6)Allowing the appeal was based upon an examination of the reasons for the delay. The issues were whether the board erred in law, whether the applicant was properly entitled to rely upon the evidence of others, whether it properly considered the factors leading up to the respondent's decision and whether the Board acted in breach of its jurisdiction.  7)In the alternative, the board could not collaterally deny benefits to the applicant on the basis that its decision was made outside its jurisdiction and, in the case of this appeal, it was not patently unreasonable. 8)The court rejected the respondent Board's application on the ground that it had already determined the respondent had jurisdiction to grant benefits. 9)The appeal was denied on the following grounds: 1)There was insufficient evidence to establish the respondent engaged in any illegal activities in the workplace; 2"
4_1994canlii5048.txt,"The Crown elected to proceed summarily and the accused entered a plea of guilty to a charge of assault under S.266 of the Code. He was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment, 18 months probation and a 10 year fire arm prohibition was imposed. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)Because the accused had no related record and given the circumstances of the assault, the sentence of imprisonment was reduced to time already served (15 days). 2)The trial judge erred in imposing the 10 year fire arm prohibition under S.100 of the Code. S.100 requires a conviction on an indictable offence involving violence against a person where the maximum sentence available is 10 years imprisonment or more. 3)The maximum sentence for assault under S.266 is 5 years if the Crown proceeds by indictment and 6 months if, as here, the Crown proceeds summarily.","The accused pled guilty to a charge of assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and was sentenced to a term of 6 months imprisonment and to enter into a probation order for an 18 month term of 18 months on certain specific conditions.

In these circumstances, having regard for the application principles of protection of society,punishment, general and specific deterrence, reformation and rehabilitation and the need to maintain the public\'s confidence in the administration of justice, the Court allowed the appeal against a 6 month sentence and reduced it to time served. The accused had now served 15 days of the sentence. He commenced serving the noted sentence on August 4, 1994. On August 18, 1994 a release application was granted. On September 29, 1994 the appellant applied for release pending the determination of his present appeal. The subject appeal came before the court and was allowed. After reviewing the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence, and particularly that this was in effect the first offence, his only previous conviction having occurred in 1989 when he was convicted of an "".08"" offence at a time when he is only about 20 years of age. The appellant submitted that in the particular circumstances the sentence imposed was too severe. He submitted that as he had now received 15 days' of said sentence, the sentence ought to be reduced to the time already served. HELD: The appeal against the 6 month term imposed at trial was allowed and it was set aside. 1)The sentence was considerably less severe than the one imposed for the offence of assault. 2)The appellant was not convicted of any of the offences listed in the summary offence report. 3)The sentences imposed were not to be varied in any event."
4_1994canlii5146.txt,FIAT Matrimonial property dispute. A previous order had prohibited the removal of any assets from the matrimonial home and the disposal of all other assets. By this fiat an order was granted pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 344 itemizing the household contents and personal items removed by the respondent from the matrimonial home in order to allow for a Writ of Delivery and prohibiting the respondent from disposing of any of the assets that the respondent had removed from the matrimonial home and also requiring him to pay all outstanding utility payments and other expenses associated with his occupation of the matrimonial home. The judge declined to cite the respondent for contempt.,"FIAT. Following a trial before me in November 1993, the courtissued a judgment dealing with a number of issues including the division of matrimonial property. At issue was the return of old household belongings which had been removed in the previous judgment and any losses experienced as a result of no insurance coverage between September 28 1993 and December 29 1993. Counsel for the respondent took issue with the jurisdiction of the Court to deal with the relief sought by the applicant on the ground that no formal extension of the judgment of December had ever been issued. HELD: 1)The respondent was ordered to return to the petitioner the list of household contents and personal items removed by the respondent in the last judgment issued. 2)The court was left with no alternative but to assist the petitioner in regaining the assets taken out of the house by granting the order sought subject to one or two modifications. 3)The law permits the court to vary its judgment and to give directions on how the judgment should be carried out whether or not a formal order is issued by the Court."
4_1995canlii6069.txt,"The accused was convicted of assault. He contends that the trial judge so concerned himself with the question of credibility of the complainant and the accused that he overlooked his duty to consider evidence of a witness, 'together with the rest of the evidence, with a view to determining whether it raised a reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt, irrespective of whether he believed the evidence of the complainant.' HELD: Appeal dismissed and conviction accordingly affirmed.  1)Great deference to findings of credibility made at trial should be shown. 2)The trial judge did not say that he found the accused guilty only upon the credibility of the complainant and the accused. He said that he found the Crown's evidence to be credible, and the accused's evidence not to be credible. The Crown's evidence was comprised of both the complainant and the witness. 3)The trial judge's findings are supported by the evidence and his conclusions are not clearly wrong so as to make the conviction unreasonable.","The appellant contended that the Provincial Court judge so concerned himself with the credibility of the evidence of the complainant and the accused that he overlooked his duty to consider such evidence with a view to determining whether it raised a reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt. HELD: 1)The accused was convicted of the assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.  2)The trial judge did not fail to take into account his own evidence, particularly the complainant's evidence, which was to be all that was considered. The Crown's evidence was comprised of the two accused. 3)The appellant was found guilty of the charge of assault on the complainant. He argued the necessary implication was that the trial judge took into account only the evidenceof the complainant & the accused to the exclusion of the accused. 4)It was not shown on the transcript of the trial that the accused had any wrong or unreasonable deference to the Crown. The trial judge was aware, as he was a Crown witness."
4_2007skqb438.txt,"The parties have two children, a son born March 1990 and a daughter December 1991. A trial on the issues of the son's residence in 2006, the parties' income for the purposes of child support and any s. 7 expenses was held. HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son. This is a period of no more than 5 months. Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.  2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629. The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3) The parties have been divorced since 1998. The son has played baseball since 2004. The daughter has speed skated since 2001. The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father. It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years. The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription. The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%. Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5) Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794. His income is considerably higher now. His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","The respondent father applied to vary an order made May 14, 2002 for child support payable to the petitioner mother on behalf of his two youngest children, Michael, born March 15, 1990, and Jessica, born December 30, 1991. Although the agreement stipulated that he live with his maternal grandmother, the mother paid his father's expenses, including fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating. The current s. 7 expenses total $4,261. The father is to pay support in the amount of $1,486.00 per month for as long as they remain children within the meaning of the Divorce Act. In this case, Michael began living with his mother at least 40% of the time in September 2006. This ended in January or February 2007, which is a period of no more than 5 months. Thereafter, he resumed living with the grandmother and was supported by his mother. HELD: 1)The parties did not speak to one another, notwithstanding the difficulty it undoubtedly caused their children. 2)It was not practical to order the mother produce receipts for reimbursement from the father. 3)The father's proportionate share of expenses was 80% and the mother's was 20%. 4)The alternative acne treatment proposed by the mother for Jessica was an appropriate health related expense covered by s7 in the absence of a medical referral or prescription. 5)Costs associated with the shared custody arrangements fell within s7. 6)The onus is on the parent wishing to invoke the operation of s. to demonstrate to the court's satisfaction that a shared custody arrangement as contemplated by s. is in fact in place and has been in place for some time. While it is not necessary that there be in all circumstances written or performed by the parties, the Court must take into account three factors in determining the appropriate level of child support, namely the Table support applicable to each party; any increased costs associated with shared custody; and the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of each parent and children for whom support is sought. 7)The only evidence that the parties shared custody of the child was that Michael ate at the father's truck every night. The mother's attendance at an east side school satisfied the residency requirements of the baseball league.  8)Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application was sufficient to re-determine the issue of support based on current incomes."
4_2007skqb51.txt,"FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s. 7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, October 2005. The petitioner, who is employed as hotel supervisor, has not seen the children for the past six months. HELD: 1) The respondent shall continue to pay child support of $185 per month directly to the child care provider which represents one-half of the current child care costs for employment purposes.  2) The parties' verbal agreement following their separation that the petitioner would have the children during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday was not made into law until January 2006. There was nothing in the evidence before the trial judge that rebutted that presumption on an interim basis. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.  3) The company in issue is in its startup phase. There is insufficient evidence to establish what cash is available and whether it could be withdrawn without affecting the financial viability of the company. 4) The petitioner did not make any child support payments following the separation. Given the age and circumstances of the children, this appears reasonable on a retroactive basis. 5) Retroactive child support should be based on the petitioner's 2004 income. The verbal agreement between the parties had him pay $1,200 per month in child support for 2006. The respondent was not prepared to vary the terms of the verbal agreement."
4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The offender pled guilty at the opening of trial to distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The offender had 1,200 postings on the website, which included 11 stories that were the subject of the charge. The site encouraged stories, and the offender encouraged others to submit stories. HELD: The offender was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years, as well as the addition of an order requiring him to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, 2004 for a period of 20 years. The terms of the three-year probation order were as follows: 1) Keep the peace and be of good behaviour; 2) Appear before the court when required to do so by the court; Report to supervisor within two working days from the date of release from jail and thereafter continue to report as directed by the supervisor; 3) Denounce and deterrence are the dominant principles of sentencing. The Crown submission that the writings do not in their production actually harm children the way production of images does, and therefore should not be subject to the same denunciation, was rejected. The Court found that the offender was more of a voyeur than actively sexual with girls and that his stories were told to encourage others to produce similar stories in order to deter others who might be inclined to engage in the same activity."
4_2009skca102.txt,"The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","The Crown appealed a sentence of 26 months in pre-trial custody and 2 years probation imposed following the death of their 7-month-old daughter. The mother had been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and her previous criminal record included convictions for possession of a weapon and mischief. She had refused post-natal health services, and had avoided contact with child welfare agencies for three months prior to the offence. At the sentencing hearing, the Crown and defence agreed the appropriate range of sentencing for manslaughter was four to 12 years. The issues were framed by the arguments and cases submitted by the parties. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis of the first two grounds: 1) that the sentencing judge did not give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability and 2) that there were mitigating factors including the mother's dysfunctional upbringing, her mental disorder which resulted from that background, and her social and economic situation. These factors led to the conclusion that post-traumatic stress disorder was a mitigating factor and that the sentence imposed would not be appropriate given the range of sentences imposed for offences of this nature. The sentencing judge also failed to take into account the factors the mother had previously been convicted of, namely, having been sexually assaulted and domestic abuse. These are significant mitigating factors that warrant a reduction in sentence. 2) The sentence imposed on the respondent was found to be in the range prescribed by the Province in R. v. Hathway, [6] which held that it is appropriate to impose a sentence with a factor of four years less a day to be followed by two years probation. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence as demonstrably unfit."
4_2011nssc71.txt,"The judge declared the defendants could pay legal fees from third party loans without offending two prior execution orders that prevented them from disposing of any property. The declaration was explicitly made on the assumption that the loans would not be secured against the defendants' existing assets. Later, the defendants' counsel wrote to the court essentially indicating he could not confirm the loans would not be secured against any assets. The court issued this supplemental decision. In the absence of any evidence the loans will not be secured against assets already subject to the execution order, or will not otherwise reduce those assets, the order and declaration sought can no longer be granted.","The defendants sought an order confirming their ability to pay certain amounts for billed and unbilled time without violating the terms of two execution orders previously issued against them, as Hfx No. 190408 against the judgment debtors to the plaintiff and Sable Mary Seismic, who were successful litigants in this action. HELD: The defendants were ordered to pay the retainers and legal fees referred to in the decision. The court was unable to grant the order that accompanied the notice in the matter of costs."
4_2015skca111.txt,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","In October 2014, Turcotte J. ordered the defendant to pay retroactive child support for a period of time varying from January 2009 to August 2012 inclusive. The parties had agreed in May 2011 to fix support by varying the 2011 Variation Order. In September 2012, the defendant abandoned his request to change the primary residence of his former spouse to a different residence and applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for an order varying the amount of child support payable by the parties. The defendant filed an application for variation of the variation order in which he alleged that he had been misapprehended facts and that he did not advise his wife of changes in circumstances. Turcote J. found the 2008 Variation order to be an interim order and the Court awarded retroactive payments in that amount to the defendant in 2012. At issue was whether the Court could vary an interim or final order on an interim basis for child support is governed not by common law principles but by the Divorce Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)It is important not to confuse the lines of authority. Percknow is good law, but it relies on common-law principles and does not necessarily apply to child support orders. 2)The defendant failed to inform his former wife of the material changes in the 2009 financial information to be exchanged rather than at some earlier time. The failure to inform the parties of the 2009 material changes was 'blameworthy conduct within the meaning established by D.B.S.' Given the wording of the 2006 Consent Child Support Order, which does not direct that an adjustment should be made as of a particular date, that issue does not arise in this appeal. 3)If the defendant had the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order, it was in conflict with the consent order of the parties in accordance with their prior agreement. It was not necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied. 4)Each party filed an 'Application for Variation' with the court pursuant to RSC 1985, c 3 (2d Supp). The Court was not asked to overrule it."
5_1994canlii4866.txt,"The Plaintiff's 1989 Ford F150 1/2 ton truck caught fire and burned in his garage. This model of truck was subject to a recall by Ford to correct a fuel line defect. The Plaintiff called several expert witnesses who testified that, in their opinion, the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire. Ford called one witness who was the designer of of the truck's fuel system and a Ford employee. He testified that the defective fuel line could not have leaked sufficient fuel to cause the fire. He also admitted, however, that his prior written report contained errors. Rebuttal evidence called by the Plaintiff indicated that the check valve in the fuel pump designed to prevent siphoning from the fuel tank in the event of a leaking fuel line did not operate as the Ford witness had testified. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff had proved on a balance of probabilities that the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire. The Plaintiff's experts' evidence was accepted over that of the Ford expert. No independent experts had been called by Ford.","The plaintiffs claim against Ford for damages from a fire in their garage which they allege was caused by combustion of vapours from gasoline leakage from the fuel tube of a new truck they purchased from Ford. The action against Country Plaza was discontinued. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs' theory as to how the fire started was proven beyond a balance of probabilities. Due to extreme winter weather the electrical insulating qualities of the nylon fuel line were reduced to an extent that the accumulated static electricity discharged through the fuel line. During this static discharge, pin holes would be created and gasoline would leak out. There would be a flashback to the area underneath the truck where the gasoline was pooled. This would likely be in the wash tray which was located under the vehicle and which Clarence used to wash his truck. 2)The Court accepted the expert testimony of the plaintiffs and their expert testimony in preference to the defendant. 3)Although the plaintiffs had received a recall notice several weeks prior to the fire, the subsequent recall notice deleted any reference to off-road driving. 4)The plaintiff was awarded the sum of $50,000 awarded to the plaintiff for general damages and the $10,000 ordered in the amount of general damages. 5)The court was satisfied that the plaintiff's evidence as to the cause and origin of the fire was not solely based on the defendant's faulty fuel system. The evidence as a whole led only to one conclusion: that the plaintiffs' evidence was accurate. 6)The defendant never called any independent witnesses on their behalf and their only witness was an employee of the company."
5_1995canlii4187.txt,"This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).","The appellant contended the trial judge erred in law by applying the doctrine of recent possession mainly because there was no evidence that he was in recent possession of the stolen Chevrolet Blazer.

The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","The respondent SGI terminated the plaintiff's income replacement benefits pursuant to s.185 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The plaintiff had been injured in a motor vehicle accident and received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis that he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. After the accident, the plaintiff temporarily disabled himself and underwent physiotherapy at a physiotherapy clinic in Yorkton. He applied to SGI for an order setting aside the termination of benefits. HELD: SGI's termination was appropriate because the plaintiff was not available for recommended treatment, did not follow or participate in rehabilitation program or neglected or refused to undergo an examination.  1)SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to the plaintiff prior to and after the accident was a significant factor.  2)Section 129(1)(e) of the Act provides that a victim is entitled to benefits which are properly calculated. SGI shall pay the plaintiff the difference, if any, between the amount paid to him for the period September 24 to October 23, 1997 and the amount required to be paid pursuant to the judgment for the commencement date of his employment in Alberta. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to interest on such a date as was calculated by SGI. 4)The court was not prepared to find that the plaintiff caused his early discharge from the Yorkton Physiotherapy Secondary Treatment Centre or failed, without valid reason, to fail his scheduled assessment at Wascana."
5_2000canlii3680.txt,"After being sexually assaulted, applicant was voluntarily released from Canadian Armed Forces. She applied for and was denied a pension. Civil proceedings were commenced and the Crown defended on the basis that before initiating civil proceedings, applicant was obliged to appeal denial of pension or seek review by Minister of pension rejection. Applicant applied to strike out that portion of defence application allowed. The applicant applied for and was denied a pension. Therefore no pension was at this time payable to her. A review by the Minister would require new information and the appeal period had expired. The applicant should not be denied her right to proceed against the Crown in such circumstances.","The plaintiff was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces. She was voluntarily released from the military and did not make an application for a pension. In October 1996, DND, without the plaintiff's involvement, re-assessed her release from the Military and ruled that she should have been released on medical grounds, being disabled and not being able to perform the duties of her trade or employment. The Crown brought an application to strike the statement of claim on the basis it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The plaintiff brought an action for damages against the government claiming that under s. 4(1) of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act no action lies against the Crown where a pension is being paid or is 'payable' until the individual accepts the Minister's denial but believes for reasons unrelated to the pension application they are entitled to relief or remedy, and the Canada Pension Commission has granted the 'award' of pension in the applicant's favour'. The Crown argued that s. 111 of the Pension Act or s. 48 of the Liability & Proceedings Act could not be read having regard to the proposition that having been denied a pension by the government for sexual assault the plaintiff is now barred from bringing an action in the civil action claiming that she is now entitled to pension. HELD: The action was allowed to proceed. The limitation period for appealing the Ministers' decision had expired and the plaintiff was not in receipt of pension benefits. 1)Section 111 is a statutory defence and the Crown could not meet that onus because the plaintiff had never made an application. 2)The Crown did not meet the onus on the admitted facts that it could not bring the case within the ambit of the Act. 3)The doctrine that recourse to alternative bodies is bar to court actions has been considered by the courts in various contexts and is applicable to the present instance. 4)S. 111 is not a bar to the proceedings in the sense that the plaintiff did not pursue the administrative process in favor of civil action and the Court held that they had to pursue the same process. 5)In the present case the plaintiff has not exhausted the grievance procedure provided under the Pensions Act or the Queen's Regulations the remedies provided therein and the court would not have any jurisdiction as result of s. 18 of the Federal Courts Act."
5_2001skqb463.txt,"This judgment applies to both QBG No. 1040/98 and QBG No. 1041/98 respecting the contract between the city and Triple P Holdings and the January 21, 1997 contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required. The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.","The two contracts that play in this case are the contract between the City of Regina and Triple P Holdings operated by the defendants and the same two defendants. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the City, the general thrust of all of the evidence was that certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to the members of the Independent Truckers Association. The plaintiffs failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged on that breach and that any breach occurred. HELD: Each case was dismissed. 1)The plaintiffs had constructed their cases in reliance upon the overall affect of both contracts with specific emphasis on the contract of January 1997. The factual evidence was in conflict but found that the defendants made some effort to include the plaintiffs in the rotation. Problematically, for the plaintiffs, there is no contractual obligation in the agreement of January 21, 1997 which requires the defendants to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract goes on to specify the contractors obligations to pay in the event of a breach. 2)The issue of privity of contract could have been a critical issue in different circumstances but in the end this case will not turn on the question of privitity. 3)The case will look to see if the plaintiffs have made out the case that they have constructed. The single issue is overwhelmed by the larger issue as to what really is the contract alleged to have been breached. If the plaintiffs had intended to present the case the contract was the whole arrangement between the city, the Association, the contractor and the truckers, they would have had to draw in all the parties, including the trucking association and the city of Regina as well as all the related documents. 4)Costs claimed by the plaintiffs are excessive and do not properly take into account: Actual operating expenses for the time complained about; (b)the net affect of mitigating factors; and (c) the net affect. 5)Even if the case on entitlement had been made out, the damages could not have been properly determined without further evidence or representation."

5_2003skpc19.txt,At issue in the negligence suit was whether the defendant ought to have seen the plaintiff's vehicle in front of him and stopped his vehicle to avoid the motor vehicle collision. The only material difference in testimonies was whether there was a half-ton truck in front of the plaintiff's vehicle when the collision occurred. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was not proven on a balance of probabilities. The physical evidence did not assist and the court was unable to conclude that one version was correct and the other incorrect.,"An action in negligence arising out of a vehicle accident. A tractor-trailer slowly inched up to a car driven by the plaintiff and nudged it causing damage to the back bumper, a slight denting on the trunk lid and some damage to tractor unit. The ultimate disagreement was over the issue of whether the defendant ought to have seen the plaintiff's vehicle in front of him and therefore, stopped his vehicle thus avoiding the collision. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed without costs to either party. The physical evidence did not support either version of the facts put forth by the parties.  1)The scales of justice were evenly balanced and the evidence was, at the end of the day, equivocal. The scales were not weighing persuasively in favour of either the plaintiff or defendant based upon the oral evidence given by the witnesses at the trial. 2)The evidence contained an equally rational explanation for what transpired."

The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply abnormal obsolescence to the owner's property. The issues also relate to 15 other properties and as the issues are the same for each property they were decided by the Assessment Appeals Committee on one appeal. The Assessment Appeals Committee dismissed the appeals, finding the issue not to be a matter of the Assessor's Discretion but a matter of professional interpretation of data. The Committee found the Board of Revision did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err on the issue of abnormal obsolescence for size. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted on two questions of law.  1) Did the Committee err in its interpretation and application of the Saskatchewan Assessment Manual by failing to find that economic obsolescence for size must be categorized on a MAF by MAF basis? 2) Did the Committee err by failing to find the Assessor should have used the comparable unit method to determine whether an adjustment for obsolescence for size should be applied to the applicant's property? 3) On the use of invalid sales leave was denied on the basis the question of the sale is a question of fact and in argument the applicant said for its purposes the impugned sale did not matter. 4) Leave to appeal was denied on the issue of the standard of proof that there was no error demonstrated.","The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. The issue is the use of invalid sales and the alleged improper onus or standard of proof. The sale was impugned and the question of the sale did not matter. The Assessor determined the specific MAF neighbourhoods based on industrial property sales. However, in determining the existence of abnormal obsolescence for size the Assessor worked on the basis of aggregated sales from different Maf neighbourhoods. The Committee did not view the matter as one of assessor discretion but saw it as a matter of professional interpretation of data. At the outset the door may still be opened, but the key to opening it is a demonstrable case of concrete and material failure, particularly as it may relate to the general, though not necessarily so confined. The key certainly does not lie in speculative, abstract, or harmless failures of process related to the particular. No error has been demonstrated and no law arises."

The issue is whether the plaintiff's claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act, and if so, whether the affidavit filed in support of the issuance of both of the pre-judgment garnishees complies with s. 3(2) of the Act. HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.  1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons. 2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand. Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement. 3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant. The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing. Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act setting aside the plaintiff's pre-judgment garnishee in which $2,291.90 was paid into Court from the defendant's bank account at Biggar and District Credit Union on December 7, 2005. The issue was whether the claim was a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act and if so, whether the affidavit of the plaintiff filed in support of the issuance of both the garnishees complies with s.3(2). HELD: The application was dismissed with fixed costs.  1)Prejudgment Garnishee is an extraordinary remedy and failure to strictly comply with the provisions of the act goes to jurisdiction. 2)The affidavits filed by the applicant and the affidavit by the plaintiff are not considered in this application.  3)There are four purposes of the affidavit filed pursuant to the Act: prejudgment guishee, a prevenger, a defence and counterclaim, a garnishment of interest at 2.0% per month compounded monthly and a declaration that interest is not to be paid on the account in the amount of $24,155.94.

5_2006nsca41.txt,"The plaintiff company commenced an action against a former employee/shareholder for breach of fiduciary and employee duty. The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company. The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action. The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","The appellants sought an order permitting the defendant to withdraw his admissions and add a claim for an 'oppression remedy' pursuant to s. 5.03 of the Companies Act and leave to him to commence a derivative action. The defendant had previously been a director of the company and had resigned in early 2003. He had filed a cause of action in defamation against the former director and sought declaratory and injunctive relief to give effect to the plaintiff's motion for an interim injunction restraining the defendant from holding a shareholder's meeting at which it was intended that final decision would be made to terminate the defendant's employment and to invoke the token buyback share value of 1.00 as per the terms of the 1994 shareholder agreement. Oickle, the other appellant, applied for leave to appeal on the basis that the judge erred in the test he applied when he determined that the defendant should be permitted to withdraw the admissions. Allowing the application to proceed was a strong reason for concluding that it would be unjust to hold the defendants to the admissions in the defence drawn by former counsel. There were no equities weighing significantly against the justice of the request but the court was satisfied there was evidence before it on which it could conclude that there was a triable issue and that it was justifiable to grant the amendment."
5_2006nssc43.txt,"The plaintiff alleged that a small piece of metal seen dangling from beneath the defendant's tractor trailer flew out from under the trailer as it passed the plaintiff's vehicle and hit her engine hood, bounced in the open window and caused her to lose control of her vehicle. She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control. The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled. Application for summary judgment granted; the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success. The plaintiff cannot resist a summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff's credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge.","The plaintiff was driving from Halifax to Seabright when a tractor-trailer passed her vehicle. She claimed a piece of metal fell off of his vehicle, fell to the pavement, bounced on to the engine bonnet of her vehicle and hit the windshield of the plaintiff's vehicle. The plaintiff claims damages for injuries to her arms, shoulders and neck. The defendant engaged two experts to examine the piece of Metal and reported that it did not come from the tractor trailer. The experts' reports did not show any corrosion or damage to the vehicle but there was a small but significant difference in the thickness of the sheet and the type of coating applied to it. HELD: The defendant had met the threshold test of establishing that there was no material issue requiring the court to make a finding of negligence. The court found that the defendant had not seen the object that she drove over, which flew from beneath her vehicle, and caused the plaintiff to swerve in avoidance of it hitting his windshield. She lost control and was hit by an oncoming van. The vehicle was totaled and the plaintiff suffered damage to her eyes, neck and face. Although the experts' report did not support the bare allegation that the object had flown from the defendant's vehicle, the defendant argued that it had been part of his tractor trailer prior to the plaintiff being hit by the same piece of object. Further, the plaintiff acknowledged that she saw the object fly from the trailer and that her son was in the driver's seat when she removed her hands from the steering wheel to brush the metal away from her face. Her son testified that he also saw the piece fly and that his eyes were knocked off his face to the floor of the vehicle. In addition to the two expert reports filed by the defendant, there was evidence that one of the defendants had been speeding and thus there was an issue to be tried."
5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253 and 253(b). The Crown called all its evidence on the first date and the matter was adjourned over two lengthy adjournments at the request of defence for the purpose of canvassing the possibility of calling an expert in relation to the neurological condition of the accused. Defence raised a number of issues, including whether the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer, based on fresh tracks in the snow, his condition in the vehicle, his repeated questions and the accused's confirmed consumption of alcohol. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe (and in fact did believe) that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample. All of the requirements of s. 254(3) had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court found that the officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the person and wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. Law enforcement is important but must clearly wait until law enforcement is involved in a practical sense to make a demand for samples of analysis. Law Enforcement is also important but, in this case, the court found, as here, an individual is deemed to be in care or control of motor vehicle by virtue of the presumption found in s.258(1)(a). The Court also held that a person with a blood alcohol content in excess of.08 must be put at risk of injury or loss of life. 2)Since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, with no risk of setting it in motion, the evidence proved it was vehicle as contemplated by the Code for the purposes of care and control. The totality of the evidence would lead any reasonable person to that conclusion. The accused subjectively formed the opinion that his ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)There was no other evidence that established that the accused actually spoke to a lawyer. 4)The accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights were infringed. 5)The Court held that there was nothing in the language used"
5_2008nssc113.txt,"The mother of two boys, ages 12 and 13, applied to vary access to add a condition that the father only be allowed to drive with the boys in the HRM, on roads with a speed limit of 80km/hr and under. She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party. Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work. She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","The father applied for a change to the Corollary Relief Judgment, alleging that the mother had failed to provide adequate access and communication with his four children. The father had been denied access with his children for multiple sclerosis. He requested that all restrictions on his access with the children be removed including the provision restricting his marijuana use to eight hours prior to driving. The mother opposed the application and requested that the matter be set aside for a further organizational pretrial to be held in November. HELD: The court found that the father’s medical condition and his use of marijuana did not pose a risk to the children. However, concerns concerning the administration of marijuana and its possible effect on his driving had been raised by the father. Therefore, the court ordered that the remaining provisions of the Varied Relief Judgment continue in effect and that the cost award for the father was received."
5_2008skca56.txt,"The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment. The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault and using a weapon contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and s. 267(a) of the Code. He was tried by a jury, which convicted him.  He was sentenced to two years in a federal penitentiary plus two years probation. He appeals both his conviction and sentence. HELD: The appeal against conviction is dismissed. 1) When one assesses the case through the lens of the Yebes test of reasonableness, conclude that the verdict is not unreasonable. 2) The appellant's evidence is entirely correct to the circumstances of this case. The trial judge stressed the reasonable doubt standard and he concluded his charge with the direction consistent with R. v. W.(D.).  3) The charge in this case meets the standard of being properly instructed and the appeal to that standard is set aside. 4) The sentence imposed is disproportionately severe a collateral sanction, which was unforeseen by the appellant and his counsel at the sentencing hearing and apparently unintended by the sentencing judge. 5) The fact that the appellant would have had no appeal against the sentence of two years or more, he would be guaranteed the opportunity of appearing personally or having legal counsel represent him on his appeal of such an order."
5_2009nssc218.txt,"The defendant was found guilty of attempted murder after he used a handgun to shoot the complainant outside a bar. He had a previous record for non-violent offences., defendant sentenced to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment; aggravating factors included the defendant's possession and use of a handgun in an area where a number of people were close by and that a bullet had found its way into a nearby residence.","The two accused were jointly charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in relation to shootings in the early morning hours of December 10, 2006. Following a preliminary inquiry, both accused were committed to stand trial on April 4, 2008. Both remained in custody until October 29, 2008 when they were released on judicial interim release under the Adult Bail Supervision Program. In this case, the accused served approximately 17 months of pre-trial custody while on remand and he should be credited 34 months for this dead time. The offence was particularly serious because of the presence of at least 2, probably handguns being fired in an area where a number of people were close by at the after hours bar known as Vegas. Quite a few shots were fired and two persons died as result of the gunfire. The accused was acquitted of both counts. A sentence of 9 years should be imposed with a credit on a 2 for 1 basis for his pre- trial custody and a credit for time spent on post-trial release for the firearm. The offences were particularly serious in that both accused had prior criminal records for non-violent offences such as fraud, possession of a controlled substance and careless storage of a weapon. This case demonstrates once again the presence in our community of illegal handguns and that at the time of the shooting he intended to cause the death of Vantino Beals. The community was loathe to assist the police in their investigation. HELD: The sentence imposed was one of years, months incarceration. A DNA order would be ordered pursuant to s. 239(1)(a) of the Criminal Code providing for a maximum penalty of life imprisonment with a minimum punishment of four years where firearm is used in the commission of an attempted murder and a global sentence of 15 months. The sentence was at the high end of the range set out by Blacklock J. in R. v. T.H. The Court must consider the nature and circumstances of the offence and the character of the accused."
5_2011nsca46.txt,"The defendant, who was found guilty of the careless use of a firearm, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace and possession of a restricted or prohibited firearm applied for bail pending appeal. He had been found, in his residence, with a firearm licensed in Alberta but not licensed to be brought into this province or possessed here. The defendant had residences in both Alberta and Nova Scotia but his Halifax residence was now up for sale and he travelled extensively around the world for his work. Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction. Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions. The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","The appellant appeals his convictions for careless use of a firearm and unlawful possession of a weapon. He alleges the trial judge erred in failing to find a breach of the Charter when the police entered the appellant’s condominium and failed to grant remedy as well as in finding that it was unreasonable for the appellant to take a loaded handgun to the door in all the circumstances. He also alleges the minimum sentence provisions of s. 95(1) are unconstitutional. HELD: The appellant is released on terms set out in R. v. Renacci. The grounds of appeal are weak and must be balanced in the public interest. 1) The appellant has no criminal record, substantial assets, a favourable pre-sentence report and has been on bail for 16 months without incident. The Crown cites the seriousness of the charges, drug abuse and the drug trade generally heighten public interest and perception where drug trafficking is concerned. 2) There is no evidence that the appellant poses a flight risk. If everyone using firearms in furtherance of other illegal activities in the community would be advised to exercise caution and show cause why they should be granted bail prior to trial, they would be met with the onus on him to comply with the terms of his release and to surrender himself into custody on a balance of probabilities.  3) The applicant had no prior criminal record. He complied with terms of release pending appeal. He was not proposing sureties in connection with his release terms as he did not know anyone in this jurisdiction who could act as his surety. 4) The court found that the applicant was not flight risk and that his proposed release plan was wholly inadequate."

He was convicted at trial on the basis of the testimony of his estranged wife and their daughter, whose accounts of what occurred were accepted by the trial judge. The trial judge found both to be credible witnesses. He also rejected the appellant's account, finding that he was not a credible witness. The appellant took the appeals himself. He contended that, in the circumstances, he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice inasmuch as he has evidence that his estranged Wife, out of a desire for revenge, had lied about what occurred. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)There are certain procedures that have to be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence. These procedures were not followed and in the result there was nothing before the Court upon which it might act. 2)On the facts, based on the judge's assessments of credibility, the conduct of the accused amounted to dangerous driving within the meaning of the applicable provisions of the Criminal Code."

The court found that the defendant had not breached the contract by failing to monitor the temperature in the freezer at the plaintiff and that the plaintiff had failed to pay for the monitoring equipment. There was no evidence to that standard that the reason the defendant did not receive a freezer temperature alarm from the plaintiff was within their control. The defendant was not liable.

The appellant transferred the land subject to the certificate of pending litigation into her name only and entered into an agreement to sell the land, which could not proceed with the certificate of pending litigation. HELD: The appeal was of sufficient merit and it was not prima facie frivolous or vexatious. The appeal, however, was not found to be of sufficient importance to the practice of law or the Court of Queen’s Bench to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal. There was no new, controversial or unusual issue of practice raised by the appeal.

The chambers judge made the decision pursuant to s.47 of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998, c Q-1.01, not vacate for a cause. The proposed appeal would involve revisiting an interlocutory order that preserves the status quo pending final decision after trial.

Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s. 15(1), 24(1) and 52(1)(b) of the Charter of Rights for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the applicants' rights as guaranteed under the Charter and that the respondent be paid all compensation due to them as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest, and costs of the proceeding. Allowing the application, setting aside the control test, and ordering the respondent to pay the applicants all compensation for the time they had spent filing the grievance, that the order infringed, denied and was unconscionable. In the area of private discrimination, an entirely new system of civil liability in competition with the dispute resolution mechanisms fostered by human rights legislation would result."
6_1994canlii3963.txt,"The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana, contrary to s. 4(2) and 6(2) of the Narcotic Control Act. RCMP had investigated a tip that a large crop of marijuana plants was being grown on a private property located in a clearing off a woods road. They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants. At trial, the court held their right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure had been violated, and acquitted them. The Crown appealed the acquittal. Per Roscoe, J.A., Chipman, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that there was no s. 8 breach because the respondents did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the field where the marijuana crop was growing. The court reviewed case law regarding 'open fields', and 'uncultivated' lands, and adopted the reasoning in Oliver v. United States, 104 S.Ct.1735(1984) in reaching its conclusion. Per Pugsley, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that the respondents had a reasonable expectation of privacy in activities carried on by them on their private property. As there were no exigent circumstances, the search was not reasonable and the evidence should be excluded.","The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana. The voir dire was held to determine the admissibility of evidence obtained by the police as a result of the seizure of 100 marijuana plants. The trial judge found that the police did not have reasonable grounds for their belief that the property searched contained narcotics, that they only had a mere suspicion, and that the warrantless search violated their s. 8 Charter rights. The respondents appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge erred in concluding that the evidence was not admissible. The appeal should be allowed and a New trial ordered. In this case, one of the factors leading to the conclusion that the search was unreasonable was the admission by the Crown of the evidence that there was a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area where the marijuana plants were growing on the property. The Crown admitted that the searches were unreasonable and that to decide the appeal on that point would be unfair."
6_1996canlii6791.txt,"Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless. The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse. At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages. They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.","The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their two children. The father and his wife, both medical professionals, claimed that the mother of the boys, his ex-wife and child and family counsellor, had wrongfully accused them of physically and sexually abusing the children. HELD: 1)The mother's justification plea was withdrawn.  2)The evidence showed that the statements were made with express malice which can be proven by extrinsic or intrinsic evidence. 3)The Court dismissed the application to vary the custodial arrangements. It held that the facts brought into conflict different fundamental societal interests: society's interest in the protection of children from abuse, society's Interest in preventing a trial in which 'no party wins all parties lose' was uncontroversial. 4)The co-defendants, who had libel and were negligent in the preparation of the reports, were found to have colluded with the plaintiffs to libel the mother and bring the matter to trial. 5)A jury trial was ordered in favour of the father and ordered on the basis of the first two reports that the children were not being cared for properly in the father's home.  6)Each repetition of a defamatory statement is an intrinsic evidence of malice. The defendant must be put on notice that he is under the watchful eye of the court."
6_1999canlii12571.txt,"The constable sought a writ of prohibition to prevent the respondent hearing officer from proceeding with the hearing into his conduct pursuant to discipline charges brought against him by the Chief of Police on the grounds there were contraventions of the Act, the Municipal Police Discipline Regulations and the rules of natural justice and the duty of fairness which resulted in the hearing officer having exceeded or lost jurisdiction to proceed with the hearing. He sought a declaration that a member of the police service must be informed of any investigation of his conduct prior to the commencement of the investigation as required by s.54 of the Police Act.; the Act does not permit the amendment in Form A discipline notice since it is a statutory form. The relief sought regarding disclosure had been abandoned by the applicant. The applicant argued that the fundamental questions to be addressed revolved around issues of statutory interpretation that must be resolved on a standard of correctness and the alternative remedies were not adequate. The respondent took the position that this Court should not entertain the application as there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act by way of appeal to the provincial Police Commission; that the Chief was entitled to amend the notice and would be entitled to grant leave if required; the hearing officer erred in holding that s.54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the subject member. HELD: The application was dismissed. There is an adequate alternative remedy which should be pursued. There were no 'special circumstances' upon which the court should exercise its discretion to determine the merits of the application.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of prohibition to prevent the respondent hearing officer, in his capacity as Hearing Officer under The Police Act, from proceeding with the hearing into the conduct of the applicant pursuant to discipline charges brought against him by the respondent police chief. HELD: 1) The applicant was a member of the Regina Police Service. Pursuant to the Act the applicant was charged with discreditable conduct. He was served with the Notice of Formal Discipline Proceedings in Form under the Act on October 28, 1998. He received no notice of the investigation pursuant to s. 54(1) of the Act. The hearing officer held that the existence of an adequate alternative remedy was held to constitute a bar because judicial review is a discretionary remedy and if an adequate remedy was available, it ought to be accessed. 2) The respondent argued the Court should decline to hear judicial review applications of interim decisions in discipline hearings. The applicant argued the fundamental questions to be resolved on a standard of correctness and that there should be an exercise of the court's extraordinary jurisdiction at this stage to prevent further denial of natural justice. The Supreme Court reviewed Matsqui Indian Band v. Canadian Pacific Ltd. 1995 CanLII 145 (SCC), [1995], C.N.L.R. 92. Lamer C.J. at 108-109 set out the factors to be considered in determining whether or not to enter into judicial review. 3) There was insufficient evidence to determine the appropriate remedy, the convenience of the alternative remedy as a bar to judicial review and the appellate body (i.e., its investigatory, decision-making and remedial capacities). 4) There were no special circumstances existing in the scope of this application. The respondent was entitled to seek relief in the amount of $1,000,000 in costs. 5) In the absence of any evidence that the applicant's right to fair hearing was affected, the hearing could proceed. 6) The factors set out in Selinger v. Selinger should not be allowed to proceed on the basis that there are contravenes of The Municipal Police Discipline Regulations. 7) In order to evaluate whether appellant's right of appeal to the senate committee constituted an adequate alternate remedy and even better remedy than recourse to the courts by way of prerogative writs, several factors should have been taken into consideration, among which the procedure on the appeal, the composition of senate committee, its powers and manner in which they were exercised, the burden of previous finding, expeditiousness and costs"
6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT. The applicants were charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana. They were scheduled for separate trials this fall before Judge and Jury. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two provisions of the authorization: a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance and a search warrant authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. A search warrant to search the applicant's residence in April 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones; a section 487.01(4) video surveillance authorization permitting the interception of private communications at the residence of each accused on the basis that it is a derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful; and a stay of proceedings on all charges against both applicants. HELD: 1) Leave to cross-examine is granted when the trial judge is satisfied that cross-examination is necessary to enable the accused to make full answer and defence. As information obtained from the electronic surveillance was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant and the subsequent search warrant both of these warrants should also be set aside. It would appear that an absolute waste of time and money to require duplication of such evidence on the Charter hearing. 2) There is no reason that leave granted at the preliminary inquiry stage to conduct cross- examination of police witnesses with respect to an authorization for surveillance is not the general rule, it is justified in these circumstances in order to prevent an abuse of what is essentially a ruling on the admissibility of evidence. The 1993 amendments to s. 187 of the Code have no such restraining powers. 3) Leave must be obtained to cross examine. The granting of leave must be left to the exercise of the discretion of the trial court. Leave should not be interfered with on appeal except in cases in which it has not been judicially exercised. 4) Leave should be granted to allow the examination of videotaped evidence pursuant to the authorizations and a warrant excluded from trial. The purpose of that purpose is to investigate whether there was any association physically observed between the two targets and those who might be involved in the drug trade prior to applying for the authorization. The Crown has the right to call evidence to expand, explain or add to the evidence elicited at preliminary inquiry. The court reviewed R. v. West (1998), 12 C.R. (5th) 106."
6_2003skqb170.txt,"The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity. The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal. Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.","The appellant was convicted of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. His sentence was suspended with a 1-year probation order. He appealed from the conviction. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1) The court found no error of law or miscarriage of justice as it did not accept the appellant's evidence that he used force only to protect the complainant from the natural hazards that existed in the location at night. The trial judge erred in law by making findings of fact based on evidence that did not exist; 2) The judge failed to apply the appropriate test for a prima facie case of assault. 3) Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of LAW. There was no injury evidence at issue.  4) The conviction could not be set aside because of the errors made by the trial judge in R. v. W. (D.) (1991) 1 S.C.R. 742 (SCC). 5) It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal for the conviction, especially in view of the court's finding that the force used by the appellant caused physical injuries. It was immaterial whether there were injuries.  6) The Court was unable to conclude that the belief in the existence of photographs influenced his finding of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a primamie case. 7) The decision to not accept photographs in favour of the appellant was largely based on the opinion that he did not cause injuries. The complainant did not testify as to the conditions in the bush other than to acknowledge that she would be unable to find her way back to her cabin. That could amount to an error in law. 8) Although correctly articulating the test used by SCC, the judge misapplied the test in determining credibility. The final comments did nothing to extend his disbelief about causing injuries to all of the accused's evidence. 9) It was not appropriate in this case for the court to substitute either acquittal or conviction. It is of no consequence that the appellant would have suffered irreparable harm if he had been acquitted of all charges.  10) There is no evidence of imminent harm inflicted on the complainant as a result of the assault.  11) There were no miscarriages of justice."
6_2004skca37.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows:[1] We do not need to hear from counsel for the respondent. I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'. He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them. [5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5. [6] We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access. The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise. The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child.","The appellant appealed the decision of the trial judge in relation to custody and access.

The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child."
6_2004skpc25.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level. The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'. There was no symbol with it. In the blank that followed was written '5000C'. This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed. The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","The accused is charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The police observed the vehicle drift back and forth between the centre line and the shoulder line within its own lane. They stopped the vehicle, which pulled over in an appropriate manner. The officers found the accused to be the driver. An approved screening device demand was made and at 1:54 a.m. the accused provided a sample into an Alcotest 7410 GLC. The result was an 'F' indicating that the accused had blood alcohol levels of at least 100 mg. HELD: The accused's charge was dismissed. 1)It is not a requirement of subparagraph 258(1)(g)(i) to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection. The make and model of an approved instrument has to be set out either in the certificate or be proven by other evidence. 2)The accused's model did not adequately describe the approved instrument and there was no evidence of impairment. 3)There was insufficient evidence to establish the accused's level of intoxication. 4)The Certificate of Analysis was a shortcut afforded to the Crown in criminal trial. The use of the certificate is shortcut afforded the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be properly designated. 5)The certificate may be used to prove facts, not law. The instrument or type of instrument used is matter of fact; whether such an instrument is an approved is a matter of law. While it is probably the same person made the alteration that is not initialled, one cannot adequately be sure of this. 'Probably' is rarely, if ever, adequate to meet the burden borne by the C.C.A. In a criminal trial it is not appropriate to comment upon issues of evidence to the contrary as contemplated in R. v. Gilbert. 6)The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s258(1(g) for the intended purpose of proving the accused’s blood alcohol content. It indicates that the samples were taken at 2:40 and 3:01. It also indicates the time at which the second sample was taken. There is an initialled change to the year from 19 to 2003."
6_2005nsca65.txt,"Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information. The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences. Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered. The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences. If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal.","The Crown appealed the acquittals entered by the Provincial Court judge on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons. The Information alleged that police officers who were in attendance at a residence as a result of a fire were advised by firefighters of two sawed off shotguns in the home. The defence admitted that on May 30, 2003, the resident of the home where the firearms were found was subject to an order prohibiting possession of firearms and that he was not the holder of an firearms licence. At trial, defence counsel brought a motion for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence of one of the elements of the offence, that is, the date of that offence, which was not an essential element. The trial judge granted the motion because the Crown had failed to prove that the date as alleged in the Information. That was an error of law. The reasons for granting the motion were so inadequate that they did not meet the test for sufficiency of reasons because they do not provide any indication of why there was insufficient evidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with reasons to follow. 1)The trial judge erred in law in that he did not provide sufficient reasons for the decision of the Crown to grant the motion. 2)Section 601(4.1) lists the factors that should be taken into consideration on an amendment application, which include whether the accused has been misled or prejudiced and whether the amendment would cause an injustice. 3)There was no suggestion that the amendment of the date would mislead or cause prejudice or injustice to the accused. There was no indication the date was relevant to the defence."
6_2005skqb211.txt,"The parties separated in October 2003. They have a child born May 27, 2002. The parties have agreed to an order of joint custody with the child residing primarily with the petitioner. The petitioner wishes to move from Saskatoon to Edmonton. HELD: Based on the loss of the respondent as an active co-parent and the petitioner's vague and uncertain plans for the child's care in Edmonton, it is not in the best interests of the child that he be allowed to relocate to Edmonton with the petitioner.","The petitioner and the respondent are the parents of the child. The petitioner separated in October 2003. They agreed to an order of joint custody with the primary residence being with the respondent. The respondent opposes the petitioner's move to Edmonton. The issues on the proposed relocation are: 1) is it in the best interests of the petitioner to relocate from Saskatoon to Edmonton; and 2) what is an appropriate access schedule for the respondent to be with the petitioner. HELD: The respondent is to have joint custody of the Child with the mother. The Court reviewed the factual background in these decisions and found it was not in the respondent's best interests to relocate to Edmonton with the sister. Based on the loss of Harley as an active co-parent coupled with Charlene's vague and uncertain plans for the child's care in Edmonton, the court found that supervised access was no longer required. The court reviewed the existing custody arrangement and the relationship between the child and the custodial parent and found that it was in the children's best interest to allow the respondent relocate. It was not necessary to deal with this as the petitioner did not have to be asked twice to look after the children. 2) The respondent's current access schedule is with his sister. It is reasonable to expect that the respondent will have access to the child on a consistent basis throughout the day. There is ample evidence that this relationship may well be the most determinative factor on a child's long-term welfare. The evidence from numerous other cases has shown that a significant psychological bond between the respondent and the child will be lost if the respondent were allowed to relocate. 3) The petitioner is concerned about furthering her education. She has her grade 12 and aunts and uncles from Alberta and White Court. 4) It is in the interest of the respondent not to relocate with the child to Edmonton, but rather to have the child have access with his or her mother. 5) The court was satisfied on the evidence that the risk of a further grand mal seizure in Edmonton would be minimized by the petitioner having access in the city. The multitude of factors that may impinge on a parent's ability to meet their child's needs make a measure of indeterminacy inevitable. A more precise test would risk sacrificing the child’s best interests for expediency and certainty. However, Parliament has offered assistance by providing two specific directions one relating to the conduct of the parents, the other to the ideal of maximizing beneficial contact between the children and both parents."
6_2007nssc119.txt,"Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies. Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history. There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down. The mother now sought the return of both children. The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect. Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation. Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency. Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately. The mother continued to require professional intervention.","The parties were involved in a rocky common law relationship between 1985 and 1995. They lived in Alberta and then Nova Scotia. L.M. and the Agency sought to have the custody order from Nova Scotia dismissed as the children did not want to live with their mother. The Agency consented to its continued involvement with the children and sought the termination of its involvement with them. The respondent, T.B., did not participate at the disposition review and had participated in previous hearings. HELD: The court found that the information concerning the children was simply not germane to the decision made by the Agency. The court ordered an ex parte order pursuant to the provisions of the Maintenance and Custody Act which prevented the children from leaving Cape Breton until further court hearing. The order was granted on an interim basis. The children were placed with the mother, who was an approved placement for K.B. Even though the Agency had failed to disclose this information to the court prior to the hearing, the mother would have been able to advise the Agency of the children's new residence."

6_2008skca156.txt,"The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","This is an appeal by the Crown from an order of a Provincial Court Judge declaring that the respondent is unfit to stand trial. The Crown submits that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, misstated the evidence, applies the wrong legal test for fitness, applied the wrong burden of proof and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The limited cognitive capacity test (limited cognitive capacity) test strikes an effective balance between the objectives of the fitness rules and the constitutional right of the accused to choose his own defence and to have a trial within a reasonable time. 2) The respondent is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse/dependence disorder. He has been diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and is unable to distinguish reality from fantasy. 3) As the appellant has grown up and started residing in foster care, it is pertinent to note that he has consistently run away from the protected environments sought for him and has begun to abuse alcohol and drugs. 4) There are strong interests, both public and personal, in an accused being fit to proceed to trial. In this case, the public interest is in ensuring that persons who are accused of committing crimes are brought to justice. The personal interests are paramount. 5) The Court adopted the higher threshold 'analytic capacity' test for determining fitness. This test is not intended to displace the presumption of innocence to which he remains entitled. The real question to be determined is whether the learned trial judge erred in holding that although the appellant can communicate with his lawyer and assist counsel in his/her defence, the accused must be able to interpret the nature of the proceedings and to appreciate his own best interest. The failure to provide a plea authorized by s. 16 restricts the accused's ability to make rational decisions beneficial to himself. 6) In asking the court to require that the accused be capable of making rational decisions in the exercise of his or her right, the court is asking this court to adopt a higher threshold threshold for fitness. The test has clearly been rejected by the courts. 7) Applying the test in R. v. Gorecki (1976), 32 C.C.C.(2d) 129 (Ont. C.A.) and Lamer C.J.C., for the majority, reached the same conclusion as the Alberta Court of Appeal. 8) The trial judge adopted the interpretation of that test in Taylor. 9) It was agreed that the test to be applied"

M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code. After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions. HELD: The accused is sentenced to 9 months incarceration. Pursuant to s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code, a firearm order was made for 10 years prohibiting the accused from possessing any type of weapon. The accused shall also supply a sample of his DNA for analysis. There is an order under s. 490.012(1) that the accused comply with the Sexual Offender Information Registration Act.

This is not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The accused did not have any significant or related criminal record.

6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff purchased a home in 1998. She engaged the services of the defendant Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased the home in 1999. It was owned by the defendants and their realtor, Mario Jacobucci, who had previously advised the plaintiff that the home had been moved over 300 kilometres from its original building site. The plaintiff sued the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She claimed aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against the husband and wife for failing to obtain a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. They failed to tell the plaintiff the home was being moved over a 300 kilometre distance from its present location. HELD: 1) The inspection of the property by the rural municipality did not conduct any inspections of moved or newly constructed residences. The realtor who provided the plaintiff with a copy of the building permit was not a party to the PCDS. She was a friend of the realtor and she was aware that she had some valid complaints about the home. She did not object to the fact that it was heated by wood and had a gas line, but she was not satisfied with the description of the gas line and alleged that the owners had been negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her.  2) The plaintiff was awarded aggravated damages in the amount of $400,000. The PCDS would be incorporated into the agreement for a further payment of $10,000, which would be enough to cover the outstanding debt of the previous owners. The offer of $285,000 was not considered reasonable in light of the extensive renovations and extensive renovations undertaken by the plaintiffs in the past few years. The home was too expensive for the plaintiff to afford and would not last for 50 years. 3) There was no discussion of home inspection at the plaintiff's residence. The evidence from the architect who examined the property and the two daughters and the husband's wife (who had recently divorced and were living with their children) was not accepted. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext. 4) The court found that the following conditions were met in the following ways: the applicant shall have proof of the value of the home by June 20, 1999 and that the applicable PCDS shall be incorporated in the agreement: a building permit shall be issued; a letter of the mayor of Corman Park"
6_2010nssc154.txt,"The corporate defendant moved (under Rule 44.10 of the 2008 Rules) for an order terminating an attachment order made against it, and under Rule 32.02(3) to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor. The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","One of the defendants in the main proceeding moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it pursuant to Rule 44.10(b) of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The plaintiff alleged the defendant had interfered with the plaintiff's timber harvesting contract by threatening violence, making gestures and other threats and interfering with the workers conducting the harvest operation. The plaintiff argued the attachment order should be terminated because it was not required to secure the party who obtained it, the existence of one or more grounds of attachment as set out in Rule 49.01(1), and that the mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants was not sufficient reason to dispose of the corporate veil. The court awarded costs to the applicant of $1,000 payable in any event in the cause."
6_2013nssc256.txt,"Rule 14.01 – Meaning of “relevant” in Part 5 The plaintiff brought a negligence action against the defendant, stemming from a 2007 fire in premises that the defendant had rented from the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought production of documents related to a 2009 fire at another location rented by the defendant. The defendant resisted on the basis that the documents were not relevant. Held, motion dismissed. Under Rule 14.01, the motions judge must decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. The party seeking production must establish relevance. Here, the only evidence was regarding the occurrence of the fires; there was no evidence as to the manner of the defendant's operation of the business in the second location that would establish relevance to the action regarding the first location. The commonality of a fire in separate buildings two years apart does not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating to the second fire.","The defendant operated out of a leased premises in the plaintiff's building two years apart. The building was damaged by a fire in October 2007 and the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant seeking damages, alleging negligence. After the fire the defendant moved to another location. In May of 2009 another fire occurred at the defendant's location resulting in destruction of that building. The plaintiff moved to a new location and sought production of all documents relating to the second fire, specifically: a complete copy of any investigative files prepared by government authorities; any photographs of the aftermath of the fire; any internal investigation, including statements by employees or others; and a complete file of any insurers who carried out investigations. The defendant submits the documents are relevant to the present action. HELD: The motion was dismissed with costs to the defendant in the amount of $750. 1) Rule 14.01 displaced the former semblance of relevancy test. The range of discloseable documents has been narrowed to relevenancy. This requires motions judge to decide releviancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. 2) Rules 14.08 and 15.01 displacing the former sense of relevuancy test were replaced by rule 14.02, which allowed motions to discover and discovery without further evidence. 3) Rule 13.01, the meaning of relevant in Part 5, no longer relevant, had the same meaning as at the trial of an action or on the hearing of an application."

The petitioner was entitled to spousal support from the date that she put the respondent on notice of her application for spousal support. The respondent, at age 61, should not be forced to work overtime in order to meet his spousal support obligations. The Court found there was economic disparity between the income of the petitioner and the income of the respondent and awarded an interim award of non-compensatory spousal support in the amount of $400 per month, retroactive to November 1, 2013, until further order of the Court.","FIAT: Following the provisions of the Divorce Act for awards of spousal support, the court considers the economic disparity between the respondent and petitioner's incomes that is $79,320.00 versus $56,103.00, is sufficiently disparate and upon which an interim award of non-compensatory spousAL support is appropriate. HELD: The respondent is to pay $700.00 per month commencing November 1, 2013 and on the first day of each and every month thereafter until further order of the court. The petitioner, having been the successful applicant, shall have her costs fixed at $1,200.00 and payable by the respondent, forthwith. 1) The court does not compel a payor to work more than a 40 hour work week by attributing to him an income which is based upon significant overtime income. At the respondent's age and given his state of health, this Court will not compel the respondent to work any more than 40 hours of workweek. At this time the respondent earns rental income from leasing farm land. The net rental income yields $8,000 to the respondent. Given that the respondent is in receipt of CPP benefits of $6,540 per annum the sum of the respondent’s annual income is adjudged to be presently $79.320. The total income of the petitioner is $56.103, consisting of wages of $50,603 and $5,500 derived from oil lease revenue. 2) The respondent indicated that he intended to work standard 40 hour hours per week at the rate of $28.50 per hour. This represents an annual income of $59,280. The respondent also earned rental income. 3) The SAGEG, as a guide only, is used to determine the amount of support a party should receive in an application for interim support and is not relied upon by the court as to whether the award should be left to final adjudication and not be granted upon an interim application for child support. 4) The petitioner was awarded costs at 1,200 for each of the parties."

To jump immediately to an analysis of the facts premised on a different interpretation does not serve. The interpretation of the board of s.37 was not patently unreasonable. It does not apply to other areas of the law, such as financing, conveyance of property or insurance, where a more precise and predictable delineation may be appropriate.

This is its function. To emphasize facts of lesser traditional legal significance in the Board's judgment and those of more concrete significance in a parallel area for example, property law begs the real question. 4)A review of the state of integration and the degree of operation of the Centre would not have been appropriate if the Board had taken a less rigorous and legalistic view of the meaning of successor in s. 36 than that ultimately taken by the chamber judge. The Board, in its decision, was not prepared to limit itself to indicia of transfer of title or assets of nature which might be more pertinent in the context of financing arrangements, insurance contracts or other such matters. 5)It was undisputed that the long term intent was this integration. 6)There were no circumstances in which the Board could have taken a more rigorous and rigorous view of successor.

The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the plaintiff. At issue was whether the Chambers judge erred in determining that the action against Chrysler had no reasonable chance of success and whether the lease agreement had none of the characteristics of a rental agreement as contemplated by s. 62 of the Motor Vehicle Act. The reverse onus provision did not apply in this case. The appellants had filed an affidavit arguing that Chrysler was not acting as a servant or agent of Chrysler in the operation of the vehicle and that the plaintiff failed to show that her claim for vicarious liability was not supported by the facts. On appeal, Gilbert argued that Chrysler's claim against the appellant was that the it was vicarious liable for negligence of Giffin fell into the 'lease with right of purchase' exception to the definition of owner. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The Chambers judge did not err in determining there were no material facts in dispute and it was incumbent on him to make the determinations of law arising from those undisputed facts.  2) The lease agreement fell within the LEA exception to which the Act was applied. 3) There was no evidence that the Gold Key Lease was filed or was filed with the Registrar.  4) In a non-employee/employee relationship, the court reviewed Bazley v. Curry and found that there was no real chance of a success based on the principles enunciated in Bazley. 5) The present situation involved an employee committing an intentional tort on a vulnerable victim during the course of his employment and the insurer was not a party to the motion or on this appeal.  6) The Chamber judge correctly cited the test. The issue is whether he erred. The prerequisites for summary judgment are whether there is a material facts issue requiring a trial, whether the applicant has a real chance to succeed on those facts, whether there was a need to impose costs on the applicant, and 7) Whether the applicant can realistically claim that its claim is not vicarious. 8) The appeal was dismissed with costs to Chrysler."
7_2011nspc27.txt,"The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery. A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","The accused, a young person, was arrested after police stopped a car suspected of being involved in a robbery with a firearm at a specific address in Sackville. The car was stopped minutes after the robbery with the person who had pleaded guilty to the robbery and a gun and number of items reported to have been stolen in the robbery. The gun was found under the back seat of the car loaded. The accused was not asked to implicate him directly but said that he had been picked up at some building somewhere in Fairview. HELD: The court found that the circumstantial evidence did not support the inference that the accused was either mistaken or not telling the whole truth. The evidence of the accused’s involvement would have to be so strong that it would allow the inference to be made that he was one of the people involved in that robbery. It would also be reasonable to conclude that the person with the gun and the brass knuckles who was in the car at the time of the stop was someone who was familiar with the area where the robbery was alleged to have taken place and who was able to identify the accused. Finally, there was the absence of a gun. The Crown had proven that there was a reasonable chance the accused, K.M., had committed the robbery, that the gun was a replica of the one used by the accused and that the description of the two young men who had been in the vehicle when it was stopped, both of whom gave detailed descriptions of what had been stolen from the vehicle and the descriptions of the other two men (K.M. and the gun that he saw was older with chipped paint) was consistent with that description."

HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","The court refused to issue summonses to the defendant in relation to a number of claims. The defendant had submitted 18 claims for issuing to the court on behalf of the claimants. In the interim, the defendant responded to an Interim Ruling issued by the court. The judge did not provide a clear understanding of what was going on in the interim Ruling or the principles related to an accounting by way of lawsuit. At issue was whether or not the claims should be issued pursuant to the Small Claims Act. HELD: 1)The summons was refused. 2)There appeared to be room to interpret the claim as raising certain constitutional questions. 3)The language used in the summons was an attempt to couch the prayer for relief in wording that avoids direct reference to a request for declaratory relief, however, the substance of the relief remains just that. 4)There was no privity of contract between the claimants and the federal government. 5)The court was in to the 9th month of the trial and could not make a proper determination on the issues. 6)The claimants wanted the claims to proceed in the ordinary and respectful manner they might wish to have heard from the defendant. 7)The applicant should be given an opportunity to argue the issues identified. 8)Section 7(4) of The Small claims Act contemplates a decision such as the present one. Section 8(3) provides an exception to the mandatory issuing of summons. If a claim is issued, the judge may refuse to issue a summons if it is found that the claim is frivolous, vexatious, an abuse of the Court's process or not within the jurisdiction of the issuing authority."

The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012. The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew. Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved. This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial? HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act. With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action. As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it. Since the parties had given notice that they wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case, the Court ordered that the deponents be produced for the purpose of cross-examination.","FIAT: The plaintiffs commenced their statement of claim under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Saskatchewan on April 27, 2009. Their claim is with respect to a construction residential contract of purchase and sale. The defendant corporation withdrew and Orion Morgan, president of the defendant corporation, asked for an adjournment of the simplified trial which was granted on May 2, 2012. At that time, Orion Morgan advised counsel for the plaintiffs and the Court that his corporation had recently been dissolved. Orion Morgan was listed on the defendant's affidavit of documents and witnesses dated August 10, 2011 as person who might reasonably be expected to have knowledge of transactions or occurrences in issue. More than 2 months have gone by since the affidavit of Marilee Fehr was provided to the plaintiffs. The strength of any argument of the plaintiffs being taken by surprise with the content of any last minute affidavit has been substantially diminished. The Court is going to make an interim order subject to further argument by the plaintiffs on September 5, 2012, that the Court accept Ms. Fehr's affidavit. Accordingly, she should make herself available for the purpose of cross-examination, if the plaintiff corporation still wants to file her affidavit in support of its case.

7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The court upheld the sentence of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge for the offence of unlawfully trafficking in forest products. The Crown appealed the sentence imposed on the defendant on a charge of unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The defendant was found not guilty on all of the counts. The court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the wood sold to the undercover officer was wood coming from Crown lands. Therefore, the conviction should be quashed. The Court of Queen's Bench stated that it was not satisfied that during the period the defendant harvested wood from Crown land and that he also sold wood from private lands, the Crown should not have taken this as an admission, as it was clearly unreasonable or demonstrably unfit. The evidence of the conservation officers was uncontradicted."
7_2015skqb352.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – Best Interests of ChildFamily Law – Custody and Access – Interim – VariationFamily Law – DivorceFamily Law – Evidence – AffidavitThe parties were in a high-conflict situation and brought five interim applications with various requests. They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","HELD: The application was granted. The judgment was granted and the matter of increasing parenting time proceeded to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue, even an expedited pre- trial conference. There was no reason for the denial of the divorce at this stage. The matter had been resolved prior to the matter coming to chambers. The fact it continued to be argued in chambers is perhaps more a reflection of the lack of communication between the parties than any real issue surrounding this part of the child. However, it was clear from the outset that the mother's desire to have her child registered in the Montessori program was not supported by the evidence. Therefore, the court had no reason to vary the existing parenting arrangements. The child was already enrolled in the program when the application was made. An interim order can be varied if there is evidence of risk to the children or if there are compelling reasons for an alteration. HELD: 1)The Court held that once an interim custody arrangement has been in place for some time, whether de facto, by court order, or by agreement of the parties, the non-primary care parent should not apply on an interim basis. The Court must, of course, accept its jurisdictional responsibility to deal with parenting arrangements as they arise. All of the circumstances must be reviewed to determine whether an alteration of the interim decision is appropriate at any particular time. 2)The children were already in the child's place in the school. The parents were able to transport the child to his classes. 3)The petitioner was granted custody and access. Leave was granted to return the matter to the petitioner on two days notice. 4)The application was not a variation of the existing order and the Court was not compelled to make these sorts of determinations."

HELD: The application was granted. The court reviewed the pleadings drafted by the self-represented plaintiff and found his claims had no reasonable prospect of success and struck them.,"HELD: SaskTel brought an application seeking an order striking the defendant's Statement of Claim under Rule 7-9(1)(a) of the Queen's Bench Rules on the basis that it discloses no reasonable claim and for an order for costs. The claim against SaskTel has no reasonable prospect of success. The statement of claim contains the following information: 1) the plaintiff was last employed by SaskTel in a temporary position (term) that lasted from April 2, 1990 to November 30, 1990; 2) the defendant states that it appears that the plaintiff's Claim may allege that he was injured at work during his time at Sasktel, while the defendant does not admit this fact, if the Claim is allegedly based on such injury, then the Defendant pleads the Workers' Compensation Act, 2013 R.S.S., Ch. 11 as amended and states that the Plaintiff's only possible claim is for workers' compensation benefits from the WCC. The Defendant states the Claim apparently is about events from 1990 and therefore any claim is statute barred under the Limitations Act. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to SaskTel. 1) On an application to strike, the facts set forth in the Statement of claim are considered to be true unless manifestly incapable of proof. It is incumbent on the plaintiff to clearly plead the facts upon which he relies in making his claim. Having reviewed the pleadings carefully, I conclude that Mr. Schutte's claims have no reasonable prospects of success and should be struck."
7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in these proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life is in possession of the funds. It claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the insurer whose lives were insured over the years under the Policy and whom it views as having paid the premiums resulting in the surplus. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be made. HELD: 1) While interpleader relief is appropriate, the appropriate form and nature of additional relief or direction is not immediately apparent. At this stage the competing claims to surplus are on the one hand Ag Credit and on the other hand Empire Life. The argument that Ag Credit collected monies from its clients for the purposes of paying their insurance premiums, had a fiduciary duty to do precisely that; the fact that the Superintendents' Guidelines governing group insurance provided that no other person had a competing interest to the Ag Credit's right and title was unnecessary. Since no one had a legitimate interest to contribute to the surplus, it was deemed within the meaning of the Act that all monies received by Ag Credit were property of the Crown and should be paid directly to it. 2) While there has been some debate about the appropriate way to deal with surplus, the evidence available to the Court indicates that most of the borrowers, even those who had defaulted in payment of loan obligations and related insurance premiums and Ag Credit may have chosen to nonetheless pay the premiums, rather than be placed on deposit with the Court. The economic realities of the litigation necessarily required an order of the Court to determine the appropriate amount of payment.  3) The parties involved in the action were considering various options. The insurer could apply ex parte to the court for an order for payment of money into court or in the alternative directing that it be entitled to payment of its current and future costs associated with the application or of the application."

The vessel was based in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia but was in Halifax at the end of the Marblehead race. In August 1990, an assessment of $195,785.90 was made against the respondent because the vessel was registered in Nova Scotia and had been used in the province. Notice of objection was filed and eventually the matter came before the N.S. Tax Review Board, which concluded in January 1991 that the vessel did not have a sufficient presence in the Province to attract tax under s. 7(1) of the Act. Dismissing the appeal, that the Act does not give the aircraft situs there to support tax which constitutionally must be 'within the Province'. In the case of aircraft operations, there must be substantial, at least more than nominal, presence in order to provide a basis for imposing tax in respect of the entry of aircraft into the province."" In Canadian Pacific Airlines Ltd. v. British Columbia, 1989 CanLII 94 (SCC), 59 D.L.R.

The appeal was dismissed without costs.  1)The Act, in its general structure and intent, closely resembles the type of enactment originally approved by the courts in Atlantic Smoke Shops Ltd. (1943) and [1943] The Crown corporation (P.C.L.) and later generalized to include all tangible personal property. 2)The general purpose of s. 2(4) is to prevent the evasion of tax and consequent loss of revenue by the simple expedient of consumer purchasing goods outside the province for his own consumption or consumption. The provision equalizes the burden by taxing out ofprovince purchases by provincial residents at the same rates as if the purchases had taken place in province. In this case, the statute does not apply."

8_1995canlii5717.txt,"The Respondent and the Applicant had a violent argument after which the Applicant and the child left the matrimonial home and moved to Transition House. The Applicant sought and obtained an emergency intervention order under The Victims of Domestic Violence Act from a Justice of the Peace giving her exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home and restraining her husband from having any contact with her or their daughter during the currency of the order. This order was then brought before a Queen's Bench Judge as required by s.5 of the Act for review. The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section. The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered. HELD: Order vacated.  1)An emergency intervention order is granted by a Justice of the Peace under s.3 of the Act without notice to the person whose conduct it restrains and without any representations from that person or on that person's behalf. It is an extraordinary remedy to be granted only where serious and urgent circumstances indicate a need for prompt action to protect the victim. 2)Absent such urgency, the application should be one for a 'victim's assistance order' brought to a Queen's Bench Judge in Chambers under s.7 in accordance with The Queen's Bench Rules. 3)In this case the domestic violence complained of occurred on January 28. There was no evidence that on February 1, 1995, Dolgopol was at risk of immediate harm. There was by then no element of urgency and the application for relief should have awaited the regular Queen's Bench Family Law Division chamber sittings.  4)The Court commented that it was unclear whether this rehearing was to proceed de novo or as a review but determined that the order should not stand in any event and therefore terminated it forthwith.","FIAT.

The child had no connection of consequence to the Province of Alberta.,FIAT. The petitioner sought interim custody of his only child born in 1996. Section of the Divorce Act requires either spouse to be ordinarily resident in the province for at least 1 year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding.

He was to reside with his parents in the city of Regina. In the event the court did not have jurisdiction under 15(1)(a)it would be found to exist pursuant to 15(3) as the childclearly had a closer connection to Saskatchewan than to Alberta. INTERIM CUSTODY Having found jurisdiction the issue is interim custody. Both parties make serious allegations against the other. However provision does have to be made for the residence and care of the child on an interim basis. It is a condition of this order that the child shall remain in Regina without further order from the court. It was also argued on the basis of section 15(4) that the court had jurisdiction as a result of the respondent's acquiescence.

Application dismissed; there was sufficient evidence to constitute reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrant. Overall the nature of the evidence was compelling with four separate and independent sources all confirming either that the defendant was selling drugs or that drugs were being sold at his residence; although individually none of the sources was of known or proven reliability, collectively they reinforced and confirmed each other; and the police conducted surveillance which corroborated the information provided by the sources.","The defendant applied for the exclusion of evidence found following a search conducted at his residence pursuant to a warrant issued by fax from the Justice of the Peace Centre in Dartmouth, N.S. The defendant argued that the information to obtain the warrant did not meet the test in R. v. Debot, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1140, and therefore that the warrant should not have been issued; that the search was therefore warrantless, breached his Charter s. right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, and that evidence obtained by it should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter of Rights. HELD: There was sufficient reliable evidence to constitute the reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrant. The evidence was compelling and the officer did not substitute his or her view for that of the authorizing judge. There were at least three concerns to be addressed in weighing evidence relied on by the police to justify a warrantless search. 1)The nature of the evidence, over all, was compelling. Noting the progression of dates in each succeeding paragraph of the Information, accept D/Cst. Collyer's testimony, and find that the year 2001 in the penultimate paragraph was a typographical error and was intended to read 2002. So four apparently separate and independent sources over the month and a half prior to the warrant all confirmed, with varying amounts of detail, that the defendant was selling drugs or that drugs were being sold or used at his apartment, or both. There was therefore evidence on which the justice of the peace could conclude that this was continuing activity and that it was on-going at the date of the application. 2)The existence of fraud, non-disclosure, misleading evidence and new evidence are all relevant but rather than being a separate test, their sole impact is to determine whether there continues to be any basis for the decision of the authorized judge. Here, the evidence met the standard of reasonableness."

8_2006skca58.txt,"All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement. They also agree that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause. It is clear that the subject matter of the clause is a 'Participating Interest in the Program Land or a Project Area'. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement. However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole. Accordingly, the voting agreement is not caught by subsection 14.01.","All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV of the joint venture agreement, s. 14.01 of which provides that: If a party wishes to sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its Participating Interest, the parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or disposing of any interest other than all of its participating Interest to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the Joint venture agreement; and if a party makes an irrevocable offer to purchase the Offered Interest for cash, subject to the rights of the Purchasers pursuant to Article 14(1) of the Offering Notice, it shall give written notice to the purchaser of the interest that is offered for sale and shall also state the cash consideration and other terms on which the sale and purchase is desired to be made by the Vendor to the Third Party."
8_2009nssc351.txt,"The action, originally filed in 2000, concerned allegations of breach of - fiduciary duty, trust, industry regulations/standards, contract; and claims of negligence and malpractice. These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant. The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years. The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars. There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years). While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant. There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay. After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here. On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice. There is a significant documentary record of the transactions. The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner. The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time. While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice. Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","The plaintiffs filed an Originating Notice and Statement of Claim in 2000. They claimed that the defendant RBC caused them to suffer losses on investments. Two of the plaintiffs were associated in the practice of law and one of them was a solicitor of record. RBC counterclaimed for contribution and indemnity from RBC, alleging that RBC covered the stock issues of the two companies and provided information about available gold was misleading. The defendant denied any wrongdoing, and argued that the delay was entirely due to the negligence of the plaintiff's solicitor and, therefore, was inordine. Application to dismiss the proceeding dismissed; the delay is not inordinate; the actions of RBC must be examined on the facts of the case; the court must take into account the position of the defendant solicitor and strike a balance between the interests of the parties. Although RBC did not directly or indirectly waive its right to refuse the requested particulars, it acquiesced to a slow tempo of litigation and was likely to be prejudiced by the delays."

The respondent failed to show that, on balance, an action is the preferable route. While not all of the witnesses will be ascertained quickly, the important ones can be, which is all that Rule 6.03(5)(a) requires. The hearing should be predictable in scope and length and ready to be heard within months. The issues are straightforward.

The debentureures have matured and Medusa has failed to pay the principal and interest amounts owing. The Respondent, Boone and Bough are taking steps to attempt to secure payment of their debenteures by means of an application to this Court. The application to be converted by way of a motion to convert is an application that will protract proceedings indefinitely, denying the plaintiffs their right to timely determination of their claim. In addition, the Respondent has commenced a separate action against the respondent, alleging breach of contract and resulting economic losses. In that action, Medusa will seek to have the respondent converted into an action. In another action, it will seek remedy pursuant to the Third Schedule of the 'Companies Act'. In this action, the respondent seeks to have its action converted into one action. The Court has considered all of the evidence presented, the applicable Civil Procedure Rules, the jurisprudence referred to by the parties and the able and helpful submissions by counsel for the parties. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1) Rule 6.03(3) provides a number of other factors that can go long way to make future events more predictable and more certain. 2) Rule 7.02 provides for summary judgment in favour of an action if the presumptions in favor of that application outlined in Rule 7 do not apply. In this case, the issue of damages alleged by Medusa as result of the respondent's enforcement application will be much more time consuming and costly then the application to determine the legality of the applicant's initial application. This issue will of necessity cause extensive delays in finalizing an action involving an application involving such a counterclaim. 3) The Court found that the respondent failed to meet its burden of proving the proposition on a balance of probabilities."

The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The petitioner was granted joint custody with the mother with primary residence with the father and access for the mother. The parties had separated in November 2012. The petitioner filed an Answer and Counter-Petition in January 2013 contesting the respondent's claims for sole custody, specified and supervised parenting time, the request for restraining order and costs. The respondent counter-petitioned claiming division of property under the Family Property Act, S 1997, C-8.2, joint custody of Z. and S. to be with the wife and child support for the father set aside for 6 months. The interim agreement provided that the parties would have Z. in the interim care of the mother and that the respondent would receive parenting time. The mother was to have her own home. The father was to pay child support and the parties had been locked out. HELD: 1)The mother was concerned that the father was holding her child from her and that she needed to end the relationship. She telephoned the respondent the next morning principally to try and get the child back to her house. 2)The father was in constant pain and the mother was afraid to get out of his house. 3)All communication went through their lawyers. 4)The parties had followed the interim agreement which provided that all materials would be provided to the petitioner. 5)The evidence from the parties’ lawyers was that although the father had not seen the child for some time, he was often verbally abusive, grabbing the petitioner and hugging her and saying things like “I’m sorry” and “Get out of here!” The petitioner’s counsel had accurately summarized the verbalizations in the statement of mind given by the father that the child would not be able to sleep with her for several days because of the restrictions placed on his access to the computer and the Internet. 6)The petitioner was awarded one-half of the day and one-third of the parenting time that was to be paid for by the respondent. 7)The respondent was ordered to pay $600 in child support, the cost of the settlement and the costs of the application. 8)The wife was to bring the child to her home in Warman and the respondent was to provide the other half of the household with necessities such as books, toys and books. 9)The child was to spend one day with his mother in her home. 10)The parents would have access on a shared week-on/week basis until trial could be held"
8_2017skqb249.txt,"HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel had constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The dispute concerned the exclusive right to market, licence and distribute HAL's products in Canada. The parties entered into three separate contracts in 2008 that each provided that any disputes which could not be resolved by the parties would be settled by binding arbitration. The contracts each provided an implied condition that allowed the parties to appeal an arbitrators' decision based on an error of law, which the parties clearly intended to avoid. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The language of the agreements was so clear with respect to the arbitration clauses and their finality that it cannot be overridden by vagueness or inadvertent omission. 2)Leave to appeal under s.45(2) of the Act simply does not fall into the category of the obvious or something that 'it goes without saying' in the factual matrix of this case. Such an implied term is not akin, for instance, to the implied term of good faith in contractual negotiation, or the term of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment, and if there is a contrary intention on the part of either party, they cannot be taken to have abrogated their right to appeal. 3)The agreements were not intended to be a means for an arbitrator to reach a final decision on a final, binding arbitration decision. 4)The parties referred to one, and only one, specific instance in which an appeal would be permitted, which was a very narrow issue. There is simply no other reasonable interpretation of such wording."
8_2018skqb217.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The judgment was set aside and the defendant given leave to file its statement of defence. The court found that the judgment should be set aside as a matter of right because it was in excess of the amount due. The judgment was also set aside on the merits. It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action. As well, the defendant had provided an arguable defence to the claim in that it pled in its proposed defence of non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act. The delay had not caused the plaintiff irreparable harm.","Civil Procedure – Default Judgment – AppealHELD: Pursuant to Rule 10-13 of The Queen's Bench Rules, Key's counsel applies to set aside the default judgment and seeks leave to file a defence. The plaintiff obtained default judgment against the defendant, The Key First Nation, totalling $102,703.62 plus costs assessed at $1,598.50. The default judgment was set aside on the basis that Sollows' counsel failed to exercise its authority to bind the plaintiff prior to the signing of the agreement. The Court cannot accept that a time frame of 28 days is sufficiently long for the court to prevent the plaintiff from defending the action. That is only 7 days past the date S.H. was permitted to note the action for default. Given that Key's then counsel responded to the action soon after it was entered, this delay is insufficient to deny the plaintiff its day in court."

9_1998canlii1737.txt,"The plaintiff paid its municipal property taxes as assessed for three years. On appeal it was held to be entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total amount of $420,000.

Awarding 5 months interest, that the date from which interest is calculated in this type of action is upon completion of the appeal process. An appropriate interest claim under s. 41(I) therefore only exists for the five month period between the Court of Appeal's assessment determination and the refund of the property tax five months later.","The plaintiff municipal tax payer paid its property taxes as assessed for the years 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 but on appeal was held entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total of $420,177.13.  The plaintiff sought interest pursuant to s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra on the refund from the date it made the overpayments in response to HRM's tax invoices requiring payment of those amounts on the due dates. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld the utility and review board's assessment determination which translated into $420 million overpayment of taxes. HRM paid the refund of overpaid real property taxes to Canada Trust, pursuant to S. 90 of the Assessment Act, and sought an interest rate of 8.75% being a rate equatable to the interest charged by HRM on overdue taxes (prime plus 4%)) on the principal amount for the five month period between the assessment determination in March 1997 and the payment of the property tax refund in September 1997 as well as on the unpaid interest until the date of judgment. HELD: There was no cause of action for return of any over payment of taxes until after the appeal provisions of the assessment had been exhausted. Interest could be claimed at a rate of 1% being an equalization rate on that principal amount from the time of receipt or when the assessment was recalculated. No order was provided for recovery of the overpayment.  1)Costs were to be determined on a case by case basis by way of brief written submissions.  2)The court had no jurisdiction to make the appropriate calculations and subject to any agreement the court would hear the parties as to costs."

In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed. Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision. The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case. The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.  4)There was no order as to costs as success was divided.","This appeal was taken under s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. It was from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board. It is one of a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor to assessments for municipal tax purposes. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the same basis as the grounds of appeal in respect of the 1997 assessment of Market Mall. 1) Market Mall had an excess of common area that required a reduction for functional obsolescence and that the underground parkade was functionally obsolete. The definition, 'caused by changes in demand, design and technology which resulted in loss in the utility', does not appear to apply to an add on type of construction but rather vintage building when design standards were different and building has seen its day. The present method of assessing the common area is reasonable. 2) The appeal is arrived at not as a result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but as a consequence of the failure to establish to the satisfaction of the committee the facts on which it based its case.  3) The decision is beyond our jurisdiction."

HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1)On the evidence, the court found that the accused cannot rely on the Criminal Code s.34(1) for his defence. There are too many variables and probabilities. 2)The accused would have had to commence the assault without justification and without the intention to cause grievous bodily harm and he must have used no more force than is necessary to protect himself. 3)The evidence did not support the notion that without justification the accused provoked the assault upon himself.

It is uncontroverted that Brina has disabilities that necessitate certain tools such as a computer for her to be successful in her post-secondary training. HELD: 1) The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses and there shall be an order accordingly. 2) The September 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in Brina's s. 7 expenses.

There were four grounds of appeal: 1) an application to admit new evidence on appeal; 2) a constitutional challenge seeking a declaration that the bylaw was ultra vires for uncertainty; 3) the significance of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw; and 4) the meaning of the word 'livestock' in the bylaw. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) New evidence will not be admitted on an appeal if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial. Further, new evidence will be admitted only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial. Neither of these requirements is met. 2) The constitutional challenge is not properly before the Court as notice is required when the constitutionality of a bylaw is impugned. In any event, the uncertainty on which the appellants rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist. 3) The appellants misunderstand the use of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw. 4) Whatever definition of 'livestock' is used, the definition always includes cattle.","At a June 2, 2006 trial in Provincial Court, the appellants were found guilty of breaching a bylaw of the Rural Municipality of Vanscoy No.345. The trial justice convicted them of breaching Bylaw 2-1995, which provides that no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned hamlet. The appellants did not lead evidence at trial. They did not dispute that they were keeping cattle on their property. Their defence related to points of law. HELD: The application to admit new evidence was dismissed. 1)The appellants had not given notice under the Constitutional Questions Act. Notice is required when the constitutionality of bylaw is questioned. 2)The uncertainty suggested by these appellants does not exist. Under the no livestock policy no livestock is permitted in the district. Cattle are livestock, and so cattle are not permitted in that district. The three bylaws tendered by the appellant do not bear upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue at the trial. The amendments to the zoning bylaw do not relate to any issue in this matter. The letter from Saskatchewan Government Relations and Aboriginal Affairs did not refer to proposed amendments in the letter. The proposed amendments relate only to the basic planning statement, not to the bylaw under which they were convicted. 3)In the absence of a specific definition of livestock, the word is uncertain. It can be defined so broadly as to be either meaningless or unenforceable."

The Attorney General and the Board had refused to appear at the hearing because their request for adjournment had been denied. At that hearing, the Board requested the Council to hold a'show cause' hearing. After making that request there was a procedural breakdown between the Board and Council regarding how that hearing would proceed, with the result that the Merks license was not suspended.

The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother.

The father was directed to perfect his appeal and the stay of proceedings arising from Court of Appeal Rule 15(4) was also lifted.","The applicant mother sought a lifting of the stay of execution on the judgment of the trial judge (indexed as 2013 SKQB 212 (CanLII)) which was automatically imposed upon the father's appeal from that decision.

It was not possible to conclude that the child could be bonded or attached to either of his parents in any meaningful way. The child was essentially abandoned by both his parents from the time he was a toddler until he was 10 or 11 years old.

The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993. The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price.

Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract. 2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract. The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone. There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94.

Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.  4)Farr took a calculated risk and sold the seed which alleviated his immediate cash-flow problem. Johnson Seeds waited until the last possible day under the written contract terms to call the contract in an effort to position itself to claim increased damages for breach of contract.","The plaintiff Seeds claims damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. The plaintiff Seeds purchases specialty crops from producers and contracts with purchasers, including other traders or packagers, for the resale of these specialty crops. To secure the product for resale, the plaintiff entered into contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting of the same. The contract stipulated that the plaintiff receive a fully executed copy of the contract when the contract is executed. The defendant attempts to have matching contracts for the quantum of specialty crops required with various producers with options for differing times of delivery to match the demand of the purchaser and to meet the delivery date requirements in the sales contracts. HELD: 1)The plaintiff had verbally confirmed on at least two occasions that he did have a contract with Johnson Seeds and at all times the defendant confirmed that such a contract did exist. 2)There was a valid contract between the plaintiff and Johnson Seeds. The delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract so that it could be legally binding and enforceable. 3)Johnson Seeds knew the contract was signed. The post office was legitimate agent of Johnson Seeds for the purpose of communicating the acceptance of the offer and receiving a copy. There was no doubt in the telephone conversations between the parties that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract existed and that he had assured the plaintiff that it would be delivered. 4)A contract was not issued to the plaintiff until January 1994. It was a legally enforceable contract signed by the defendant and the plaintiff had ensured that it was executed by the officers of S.S. Johnson Seeds Ltd. (Johnson Seeds). 5)Although it may have been in the reasonable contemplation of Farr that he would receive back a fully-executed copy, there was no evidence that this was the required term in the contract.  6)The contract was binding. If the plaintiff was seeking to break the contract he must be more careful before he signs any contract in writing which does not express the essential and important terms that he believes are the essence of the Contract. The formal written contract wassigned by both parties in 1993 and both parties knew at the time they executed the contract that these terms wereabsent. The contracts were not executed by Johnson Seeds employees. 7)Although the plaintiff did not receive an executed copy the contract, there is no doubt that in telephone conversations with the defendant in November and December 1993, he verbally confirmed the contract did not exist and at the appropriate time he confirmed that it did. 8)The defendant took"
b_1999canlii13927.txt,"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the Court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial in the trial proper and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so, and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The application for exclusion was dismissed.  1)It is in the interest of conducting an orderly trial that the trial judge is entitled to insist and should insist that defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial. All issues of notice to the Crown and sufficiency of disclosure can be sorted out at that time.  2)This can quite properly occur by the application of some or all of the evidence which is already before the court and on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of that evidence can be reserved by the Court pending the determination of the Charter issue on its merits and the application for s.24 remedy, if any. 3)There will be instances where defence counsel will be reluctant to foreclose an inquiry into an alleged violation. There will, however, be circumstances where no less severe order will prevent unfairness and maintain the integrity of the process.  4)In light of these observations and what has been said in the cases, one cannot see any justification for the procedure presently proposed."
b_2002nspc32.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit and impaired driving. After being involved in an accident, the accused was taken to hospital where a blood demand was given and eventually acceded to. The accused challenged the validity of the blood demand and argued that his right to counsel was violated. Accused guilty of operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit; there was no violation of the accused's right to counsel. The officer had valid grounds to make the demand, having been advised that the accused was in an accident, that someone had said the accused was either high or intoxicated, having smelled a mild odour of alcohol on the accused and the accused having advised him that he only had three beer. Even if the accused's claim to amnesia for all the events around that time was believed, there was no medical evidence to suggest that he could not understand what the officer said to him at the hospital. Although his degree of alertness may have fluctuated, he displayed an understanding of the situation by showing appropriate concern for how much he had been drinking and asking questions which showed an understanding of his situation and what speaking to counsel would entail.","The defendant was charged under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code with operating a motor vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit. He was charged with impaired driving and driving over the legal limit. Witnesses testified that the defendant lost control of his vehicle as he rounded a curve at the top of a hill in Victoria County, Nova Scotia. The defendant was the lone occupant and had two bottles of gas at the scene when he was struck. He claimed to have had three beers in the car at the time of the demand. The officer testified that he smelled liquor on the defendant's breath and he thought it might be coming from his head. The defence argued that this was sufficient proof to warrant a blood demand. HELD: The accused was granted his s. 10(v) Charter rights at time that he was capable of appreciating and understanding the rights and that he gave an informed waiver as that is understood from R. v. Clarkson and subsequent cases.  1) The accused's mental state during the time the officer assumed some control over his situation, imposed upon him the obligations arising from s. 254(3) and (5) of The Criminal Code and read him his rights. 2) There is no evidence of lack of appreciation of the right to counsel by the accused. The accused displayed an understanding of his situation through words and actions spanning a significant period of time. 3) The Court concluded that the accused had sufficient understanding of what was expected of him, of the situation, and of his driving just prior to the accident."
b_2002skpc50.txt,"An application for a DNA warrant on the basis s.487.05 (the general warrant provision) of the Criminal Code with respect to DNA warrants does not refer to a form. The applicant suggested a tape recording would avoid the potential problems in bringing the application before a Provincial Court Judge. HELD: These concerns were raised in the January 21 decision concerning potential prejudicial or negative effects, which outweigh any requirement to swear the Information before a judge. An oath taken before a commissioner or notary is as valid as it is before a provincial court judge and avoids all the possible problems that relate to personal attendance. The intention is to make protocol work as flexible as possible, not impeding the police in their legitimate role, while making sure the court maintains its independence. Form 5.01 is specifically set out in the Code. Section 487.1 does not have a form, but even if it did and used the same words 'taken before me', that would elevate form over substance in a significant way.","An application for a DNA warrant was made by the prosecutor and, pursuant to s.487.05 of the Code, an officer was required to appear before the judge to swear the Information to Obtain the Search Warrant. The Provincial Court Judge had previously swore an Information on an Ex parte application but had since changed his mind and sworn the Information on the Form 5.01 form which was incorporated into the form. The applicant now argued that the Information as sworn before the Judge elevates form over substance in the context of the concerns raised by the applicant about the potential prejudicial or negative effects of a personal attendance by the judge on this application. Granting the application, that the information is on sworn Information and it's in accordance with the Code. To ask the question whether there is any more truth in an officer's affidavit of Information because he swore it before a provincial court judge or a Notary Public rather than before a Commissioner of Oaths or a notary public, that seems to me to be the better practice. It seems to the court that the greater value is in having the information be sworn before a judge regardless of the practical issues around it that relate to the personal attendance issue."
b_2006nssc221.txt,"Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement. Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The applicant applied to vary spousal support provisions of the Corollary Relief Judgment. Although the parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation, the divorce settlement was made in part pursuant to the terms of an agreement signed by the parties. The applicant found that there had been no material change in the circumstances of either of the parties since the signing of the Agreement and that the respondent did not take advantage of any vulnerability as contemplated by the Supreme Court in Miglin (supra). HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the applicant in the amount of $4,535.00 per month. 1)The Agreement was sound when it was signed and there have been no changes in circumstances nor in the objectives of the Divorce Act. 2)There was no pressure exerted upon the applicant and no oppression during the course of the negotiations or during the signing. The rental income more than covered the mortgage payment. 3)There were no adverse impacts on the applicant's ability to obtain employment or the costs of preparing the Agreement.  4)The agreement was not unconscionable. The Agreement provided for an approximately equal division of matrimonial assets and debts. The assets received by the applicant exceeded in value the amount received. The respondent's assumption of debts far greater in value than those assumed by the Applicant was not the only factor affecting her decision to sign the agreement. 5)There had not been substantial change in circumstances in the past few years. The parties had reached an agreement which incorporated the provisions of Miglin and incorporated its contents. The onus is on the Applicant to satisfy the Court that the Agreement was not in substantial compliance with the Act.  6)The applicant must demonstrate that, in light of the new circumstances, the parties' intentions at the time of signing the agreement no longer reflect their original intent and that they have taken heed to all of the objectives and guidelines of the Act and the court has jurisdiction to inquire into the extent to which Miglin has applied."
b_2007nsca75.txt,"A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway. When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed. Appeal dismissed. At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit. It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit. Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.","The defendant was found to have exceeded the threshold on the test for granting summary judgment. The chambers judge dismissed the application, finding that the defendant had met the burden placed upon him in the application by failing to establish that there was a genuine issue of fact. The issues on appeal were whether the chambers judge erred in admitting and relying on the affidavit of the plaintiff's lawyer, whether he accepted into evidence the exhibits attached to the affidavit, and if so, if the issue was credibility. HELD: The application for summary judgment was dismissed with costs.  1)The chambers judge did not err in describing the affidavit as the second part of the test. He did not refer at all to the evidence attached to it as evidence. The onus did not shift to the plaintiffs to show that their claim had a real chance of success. 2)The affidavit was severely deficient and did not comply with the law in Nova Scotia respecting the form and contents of affidavits. The affidavits submitted by the defendants were found to be portions of the admitted and relied upon affidavits of the defendant's lawyer. 3)There was no arguable issue to be determined at trial. The only genuine issue that should be dealt with was whether the plaintiff had proven the claim that the dog that ran onto the highway had been Hogeterp's. There were no admissible documents to accompany the affidavit."
b_2010nssc125.txt,"The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","The plaintiff was charged with dangerous driving causing death. Following the laying of criminal charges, the plaintiff's employer suspended him from work without pay. They offered at their expense the use of their legal counsel to defend him in relation to the criminal charges. The plaintiff argued that the Crown's theory of the accident was fatally flawed and that there was a clear conflict of interest between the plaintiff and his employers. HELD: The appeal was allowed and his conviction was quashed and a new trial ordered. 1)The court found that the trial judge erred when he failed to strike the offending evidence, in allowing into evidence the opinion of the RCMP Traffic Analyst, the videotape re-enactment and the related still photographs. These photographs did not prove anything so it was not necessary for the defendant to object to their admission.  2)There was a lot to be gained by having the expert's report admitted into evidence. The evidence should not have been introduced by the Crown, nor should counsel have referred to the theory in summation. Defence counsel should have raised a timely objection. The court also found that some of the issues raised by the appeal court were not raised at the time of the criminal appeal. 3)A rational and justifiable choice was made to challenge the unhelpful conclusions in Cst. Thivierge's report through cross-examination rather than through an effort to have the whole report excluded from evidence."

The defendants were granted leave from the Court of Appeal to appeal the portion of the certification order dealing with alleged breaches of The Consumer Protection Act only. The certification on the basis of duty of care was upheld. As a result, a situation existed where the class action process could continue on only part of the claim until the appeal of consumer protection act issues was heard. HELD: Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules is engaged and the entire certification judgment is stayed pending the disposition of the appeal. If the plaintiffs wish to apply to lift the stay they must do so to a judge of the Court of Appeal.","The defendants sought leave to appeal the certification order of the Consumer Protection Act (CPA) pursuant to s. 39(3)(a) of the Class Actions Act. They applied to leave the matter to proceed concurrently with the appeal on the CPA cause of action. A conference call was convened to address the issue of the next steps that should be taken. A decision on the leave application was rendered on August 26, 2010 and the matter was moved forward to September 16, 2010 at which time the defendants were given the opportunity to speak to the media. They asked to be allowed to move the matter forward concurrently because there was an appeal pending in the Court of Appeal on only one aspect of the certification certificate. HELD: 1)The class action was definitely advancing and it was not known whether the class action would proceed on the basis of one or two causes of action or two. Steps could now be taken to move this matter forward. Steps had been granted in the interim to allow the Court to review the various grounds of appeal. Steps were also granted in relation to the breach of duty of care cause of actions. 2)Leave was granted to appeal on all of the remaining matters of appeal except for the portion relating to the breaches of the CFP Act which were dismissed. 3)The remaining issues of appeal were stayed pending the appeal of the certification order. 4)The Court of Appeals was ordered to lift the stay for the first time in the matter's history. 5)The plaintiffs sought leave on all remaining matters as they were preparing to file an action for certification in an interlocutory manner. Steps should be given in the event that there is a further appeal in the coming days or weeks. Steps must be taken in the meantime to move forward with the ongoing class action."
b_2011skpc30.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care and control of a motor vehicle and care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.","The accused was charged with two counts being driving over.08 contrary to s. 253 of the Criminal Code and one count being impaired by alcohol. The accused was granted leave to cross-examine on the information to obtain blood samples as a result of the breach of his rights under s. 8 of the Charter to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. The issues before the court were whether the Information to Obtain Blood samples contained sufficient grounds to warrant a search warrant, if the information was obtained in support of the warrant, whether the Certificate of Analyst and the report were accurate, if there was a reasonable likelihood that cross-examination is necessary to enable the accused to make full answer, and (ii) that cross examination could elicit relevant and material evidence of probative value that may discredit the existence of the requisite reasonable grounds for the warrant. HELD: 1) The information was not sufficient to establish that the warrant to search for blood was invalid. The officer did not depose that the driver of the vehicle was the only occupant in the vehicle and the rest of his body was slumped across the passenger's seat.  2) There was a serious breach of the accused's s.8 rights pursuant to the Charter. The Crown and the accused agreed that the accused should testify on voir dire for the purpose of the Court making determination of the validity of the search warrant and the admissibility of the evidence. The facts arising from the evidence at trial were not fatal to the warrant and there was no basis upon which the authorizing judge could be satisfied that the relevant statutory pre-conditions of s. 256 of the Code existed. 3) The oath sworn by the officer testifying concerning the events surrounding the accident constituted a technical error and is not fatal. The reviewing judge should not set aside the decision unless he is satisfied on the whole of the material presented that there is no basis for it to be issued. The oath was not signed on the witness portion of the jurat and date in jurat. 4) The officer failed to communicate to the justice that he believed the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle which could have been accomplished by writing that he observed the vehicle being struck by a power pole and not by the driver. 5) The Certificate of Analysis was not required to provide a reasonable ground for belief. The information contained in the Information To Obtain could not be substituted for or substituted for by a qualified medical practitioner.  6) The Court concluded that the oath required the officer to provide sufficient detail to permit the justice to"
b_2016skqb297.txt,"HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made. The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.","FIAT: The petitioner application for an order granting her exclusive possession of the family home, primary residence of the children and supervised access only for the respondent father. Although no reasons were given on the granting of the interim exclusive possession order, the petitioner raised concerns that the respondent had anger management problems that made her and their daughters fearful of him and addictions to pornography and masturbation that made it impossible for them to continue to reside in the same home. The respondent takes the position that this order should not have been granted in the circumstances of this case. HELD: 1) The evidence from the outset indicates that the petitioner wants the relationship to end and that increased contact between the respondent and the children would in fact be beneficial. 2) The Court cannot conclude that there is anything to be taken from this incident that demonstrates any improper behaviour on the part of the respondent. The evidence does not support this conclusion. 3) The petitioner's reasons for this application are based on her allegations that the father habitually masturbated while on the home computer as well as under a blanket while sitting on the couch watching sports or movies while the children are present. 4) The respondent has been significantly involved in his daughters' lives, well beyond the level of many or most fathers who have normal work commitments. 5) It is not in the children's best interests to restrict access to that parent by imposing a minimum supervision access order. The petitioner has provided factual evidence as background to her opinion and the starting presumption is that maximum contact with both parents is in the best interests of the child. The onus is on the parent to rebut the presumption. 6) Counsel for the petitioner is not entitled to give opinion evidence that she does not wish to give and to which the Court cannot reasonably give weight. 7) There is no evidence of the possible harm to the children if the allegations are based upon speculation, conjecture, suspicion or unreliable testimony and evidence. Any other approach invites abuse. 8) The court weighs the risk of harm with respect to access."
c_1993canlii3443.txt,"This was an appeal of a decision which denied variation of a maintenance award where a lump sum had been previously ordered. The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application. Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court, that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation. The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances. Accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to vary awards of lump sum child support made pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act.",This was an appeal from a decision of Family Court Judge Levy. Levy held that a lump sum payment made under the Family Maintenance Act could be varied after payment. The issue was whether an order for the payment of maintenance or expenses or respecting care and custody or access and visiting privileges was subject to variation. The parties were entitled to know as soon as possible what their decision would be.

A custody investigation conducted in 1990 when the mother had first commenced this application had recommended that the existing arrangement be continued. The Father now intended, however, to move with the children to Ontario to take additional education. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Judge found that the move to Ontario was a sufficient change of circumstances to permit a variation application to proceed. She therefore proceeded to consider if the move was in the best interests of the children. 2)The Judge reviewed recent authorities from across Canada dealing with whether a custodial parent should be permitted to move with the children. 3)In the circumstances of this case the Judge was convinced that the move was reasonable and was not motivated by any desire on the part of the Father to thwart the Mother's access.","This was an application for an order varying the judgment of Dickson J. of the 5th of January 1990 in which he gave judgment for divorce and joint custody to the parents of two boys born April 22, 1984 and June 3, 1986. The mother had moved from Ontario to Saskatchewan, taking the children with her. The parties had entered into a separation agreement in 1988 in which the father agreed to joint custody, residence with the mother and generous access to the mother. In 1989 the mother commenced an application to vary the judgment by granting the father sole custody of the boys, or joint custody with principal residence with mother. The father opposed the move. He argued that it would be in the best interests of the children to have them uprooted from their home in Melfort and move with them to a virtual paradise in Aurora. HELD: 1)The father was granted sole custody with generous access.  2)The mother's application was not brought as an application under the Divorce Act s.1(6) as it was not a direct result of the father's proposal. 3)Because of the generous access the mother was granted, the father was allowed to move with the boys to any city, province or country he desired. 4)The fact that existing custodial arrangements showed that the child would have all the traditional sports and recreational opportunities available to them in Aurora, as well as a New family unit, as an 'incidence of custody' was not an issue. 5)The distance of the move was not grounds to exclude the mother's access. The list of factors relevant in determining the best interest of the child included the views of the custodial parent (which he said should generally be paid a reasonable measure of respect), the medical certificate about his condition, the parenting skills and the nature of the relationship between the parties. The evidence showed that both parents were able to providegenerous access."

The parties were married in 1985 and separated in 1995. The mother was on leave from her employment. When his federal government management position was declared redundant, the applicant received a retiring allowance of $75,646 in May 1997. The respondent opposed the application on the basis there had been no change in circumstances since the judgment was granted; she had no other income than the support payments and child tax credit; alternatively, there were special provisions in the parties' separation agreement which would permit the court to award an amount that differs from the amount prescribed by the Guidelines.HELD: 1)The judgment the applicant sought to vary was made after the coming into force of the Guidelines. It did not however include a determination of child support made in accordance with the Guidelines. There was no change in the childrens' or mother's circumstances. The applicant was unemployed but was still benefiting from his retiring allowance at the time of the order which he no longer enjoyed. A variation was warranted as there had been a change in the father's financial means and circumstances.

c_1999skqb178.txt,"Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute. The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in the proceeding, there were also questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial. HELD: The tapes were admitted to their entirety and went in unedited.  1) Although custody was of central importance to the case, there are also questions regarding child support, division of the property and the abuse that was occurring in the mother's home. The tapes have the opposite effect. They speak volumes about the father's character and motivations while shedding little light on the mother. They are primarily conversations between the father and the children, either individually or all together. There is really very little involving the mother directly. The parties have been struggling since early on in their relationship. There was a petulant and protracted outburst from the father about the fact that the mother was not allowed to wear black lipstick. He was adamant that the custody and access assessor never obtained an honest opinion from the children and the Court should not avoid the opportunity to hear the children in their own words. 2) Although the father was without legal counsel at the time of the petition, he was insistent that the father had been on the phone 23 minutes while the child cried because he did not want to be at his mother's house. The mother's recognition of past problems with depression and her progress in dealing with it through medication and counselling, as well as the mother’s acceptance of the idea that she was mentally ill and incapable of controlling herself, had the effect that the tapes had on the children."

This arrangement was not to exceed one year unless agreed to by the mother.

In November 1999, the Court issued an order that it would take jurisdiction and hear the application under S. 18 of the Family Maintenance Act.

c_2004nsca135.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, with the only live issue at trial being whether the Crown had proved the absence of the complainant's consent beyond a reasonable doubt. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review. The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt. It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence.","A cocaine fuelled encounter between the appellant and the woman with whom he was living resulted in his conviction for assault and sexual assault. He appealed the conviction submitting that it was unreasonable, was based on misapplication of the burden of proof and that the judge's reasons were so deficient as to constitute an error of law. Appeal dismissed; there was ample evidence which justified the conviction; the judge applied the proper test and did not apply his or her mind to the possibility that despite having rejected the appellant's evidence, there might nevertheless be a reasonable doubt about his guilt. The appellant had been in an intimate and drug related relationship beginning in the summer of 2003. They met while getting high on cocaine and lived together for a while after the appellant moved in to her home and wouldn't leave the premises. They moved in together in the fall of 2003 and had a sexual relationship that lasted for some time before the appellant decided to take her daughter and her friend into the city. During this time, the appellant believed that she did not consent and that her lack of consent was consistently communicated to the appellant. During the trial, three witnesses testified that the appellant had threatened to stab the complainant in the face with a screwdriver, which led to a confrontation with the knife and the threat to show the daughter the syringe and the decision to go together to take the daughter and friend back to the city was similar to the one described in the earlier decision.

In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. Both parties appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract. The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation. Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant to provide banking, blending and lifting of coal at its coal preparation plant. The defendant was the successful bidder. The plaintiff sued for loss of profits, damage to the plaintiff's equipment and breach of contract claim.

At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment. It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her. In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal. Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.  2) The contract of employment was a term contract extending from May to August 31, 2004. The plaintiff was dismissed on July 12. But for her dismissal, she would have worked for the rest of July and for the month of August or 36 days. 3) In this case the plaintiff made reasonable effort to seek and maintain employment.

The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act. There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council. The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council. The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the parties is a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. 2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful. This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care.

c_2006skqb335.txt,"FIAT: The former vice-president of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan. He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour. He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application. Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart. It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart. The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart. HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed. The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.  1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit. This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility. The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents. 2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents. There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.  3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart. Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations. Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart. However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them. Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias. To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy. That is not good enough.","FIAT: Wal-Mart is seeking an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and Rule 673 prohibiting the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board as presently constituted from hearing and/or making any orders involving the applicant. The application of the Union seeks an order striking and removing virtually all of the material filed in support of the application. In the other motion the Union applies for an order dismissing the application by the applicant that the Board be struck and remove virtually all material filed. HELD: The relief sought by the Union should be granted and the application brought by the defendant corporation should be dismissed. Although there is no admissible evidence before the court, believe my account is accurate. The documents meet neither requirement. The applicant is around and about. He must be available to swear an affidavit. The critical allegations originate with him. Absent any explanation for his absence, there has no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proferred documents as evidence. Reliability presents an equal problem. Since everything attributed to the Matkowski family has an aura of self-interest, it does not generate confidence in its reliability. At no time have the allegations been tested for accuracy and truthfulness. In reality, contradictions are found within the very documents. The actions of the Unions, the interference by the Government and the presence of certain publications demonstrate that the Saskatchewan LRB is biased or, at the very least, there is a reasonable apprehension of bias against the defendant. It is argued that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings which involve the application of a member of the Board."
c_2007nsca4.txt,"The appellants applied for leave to amend their notice of appeal in regard to an order requiring them to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications. The application was opposed, inter alia, on the basis that the allegations which underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the trial judge, were irrelevant on the application and were not ruled on by the trial judge. Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make. The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","The appellants sought leave to amend their notice of appeal. Leave was required because the underlying proceeding was an application for leave to appeal and, if granted, an appeal from an order requiring the appellants to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications in which they will be the moving parties.

Although both she and her husband had good incomes, it would still take several more years to discharge the loans without prejudicing her family's reasonably frugal lifestyle. Relief granted; to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties. The bankrupt had acted in good faith and had been unable to service the loans in the early years when she did not have permanent employment.

c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accused was charged with possession of a prohibited firearm and possession of ammunition contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Criminal Code. The accused’s brother was also charged with trafficking firearms. The evidence in relation to the firearms seized was that of a sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun, a Lakefield Mark II rifle and ammunition, in a careless manner (contrary to Criminal Code s. 86(1) x 3)) and of having constructive and/or joint possession of the firearms at the accused”. HELD: The accused was found not guilty.  1) The evidence was that the Crown had obtained a Part VI authorization to intercept the private communications of named targets believed to be involved in the drug trade. 2) The accused admitted to having the gun and ammunition in his possession. He admitted that he knew the owner of the guns and that he was in possession of them at the time of his arrest. 3) The Court was unable to accept that the accused can assert a privacy interest in order to obtain the protection of s.8 of the Charter and then, when that application goes badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. 4) There was nothing to the continuity/integrity of the exhibits. 5) The admissibility of the evidence was not dispensed with.  6) An assessment that an accused is probably guilty is insufficient. Reasonable doubt is based on reason and common sense and is logically connected to the evidence or lack thereof."

The applicant’s proposed grounds of appeal were not questions of law but of fact.,"The defendant company appealed the Small Claims trial decision, which was found to be unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence and that the trial judge had improperly interfered with one of the defendant's witnesses. HELD: Leave to appeal was denied. 1)Leave to appeal should not be granted to the defendant company.  2)The essential facts are relatively straightforward. The contract was signed on May 29, 2014. The next evening, the defendant telephoned the plaintiff and asked if he was prepared to do only portion of the seeding and to'seed along side us'. The trial judge refused to allow the plaintiff to refer to exhibit P-5 because it was not a matter raised or dealt with by the appeal judge. 3)The trial judge did nothing improper in this regard.

They seek a revocation of the grant of probate and an order that the Will be proven in solemn form and related relief. HELD: 1) The respondent is removed as an executor pursuant to the Grant of Probate ordered by the Court of Queen's Bench.  2) The Court found no evidence that either of the parties had acted contrary to their obligations to administer the estate in accordance with the directions contained in the Will. 3) In the circumstances, the application filed by the respondent is effectively stating that he is not prepared to give effect to the directions in the will. The affidavit evidence of his sons, Kent and Rodney, satisfies the Court that this is something that Evan will not do.  4) The application to revoke the grant for probate is dismissed. The grant is set aside and a solemn form order is ordered.  5) In this case, the Court found that the respondent cannot on one hand attack the validity of the Will while at the same time claim right to be executrix of that Will with all of the obligations that entails. As an executrix who was given a grant of a probate, he is obligated to carry out the steps necessary to administer it and carry out directions in that Will.  6) The applicant is refusing to co-operate in proper administration.

d_1990canlii4118.txt,"In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice. The plaintiff had correctly interpreted the clause as relating to the termination of the agreement, not of his employment. The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta. The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months.

The defendant refused, and the plaintiff went into deep depression. He underwent treatment for several years and then quit work. He claimed that he could leave the company on three months notice. He alleged that this clause did not refer to termination of his employment by the defendant but rather to a period of time when the contract would terminate.

The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company (STC). The plaintiff was the former president and chief executive officer of the provincial Crown corporation.STC awarded damages against the corporation in the basic amount of $165,000. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as might have occurred in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum; and third, that all of the plaintiff's Crown corporation service should have been calculated on the premise his annual salary was $102,000 rather than $110,000 less. The plaintiff resisted the attribution on pragmatic grounds arguing that the company had not paid any salary, that there was no guarantee the company was going to earn profit, that it needed working capital, and so on. Finally, he contended that the plaintiff should have had more time to find comparable employment. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the judgment at trial set aside the contractual provisions for payment on dismissal contained in all Crown contracts including those of Crown corporations and directed instead that payment be determined in accordance with common law principles. 1)The severance terms of the contract were arrived at with an eye to the prospective employee's prospective employment. 2)The trial judge did not err in finding the plaintiff had not managed to reduce his income for the purpose of mitigation. 3)Mitigation was not allowed."

d_1995canlii4259.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","This was an appeal from a decision in an interpleader application by the Band Council to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owing by the respondent Band under a construction contract entered into with the respondent. The respondent had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specified to the various claimants. The learned trial judge held that s. 89(1) of the Indian Act was applicable and governed the issue he was required to consider. In interpreting s. 87, 89 and 90 of the Act, the learned judge found that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, a pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, or execution in favour or at the instance of any person other than an Indian. Further, the respondent did not give notice. All assignments were to be registered under the Act. Allowing the appeal in part, that the Chambers judge erred in his interpretation of s.89(1). The Act does not either expressly or impliedly confer any greater right upon an assignee of chose in action that he had before. When an Indian is in business he or she holds and deals with his business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all other Canadians. By registration the plaintiff has preserved whatever rights it acquired by virtue of the assignment and no more. Its rights are to be determined exactly as if the Act had never been passed."

Rochon were satisfied. There was an obvious mistake which required rectification. The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did. 2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other.","FIAT.

d_2002skqb80.txt,"The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion.","The applicant Credit Union loaned the respondent $37,700 upon a security of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer. The respondent's wife had apparently been the person who used the vehicle under the registration agreement but she was never the registered owner of the vehicle until she acquired it from her husband's estate. Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made the respondent aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period between September 11, 2001, to November 14, 2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The wife sought to defeat the bank's security interest upon the ground that she was at all times the person named in the registration certificate pertaining to the vehicle, had made the payments and was always in possession. All other indicia of ownership were in her favour. The Court held that ownership does not depend upon registration. There are many unregistered vehicles.

At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","At the conclusion of the Crown's case, the defence brought a motion to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, such evidence flowing from an invalid approved screening device demand, which infringed the accused's s.8 and s.9 Charter rights. At issue was whether the arresting officer formed the requisite belief necessary to make roadside demand pursuant to s.254(2). More specifically, whether the officer's determination that the accused motorist had 'consumed alcohol' was sufficient to bring it within the parameters of this section. HELD: 1)The words 'had consumed alcohol' were insufficient insufficient for the court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in his body at the time of the ASD demand. 2)Evidence of consumption manifested by physical observation and/or through dialogue with the motorist may well provide such a reasonably reasonable suspicion. The threshold is far lower than the required belief to make a formal breath demand. The wording of s.24(2) is clear and unambiguous. It does not leave a trier of fact with the necessity of drawing inferences that consumption of alcohol at some point in itself equates to having alcohol in the body. 3)There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the second count, same is dismissed against the accused."

He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","The appellant father was ordered to pay maintenance for his son pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act. The issue on appeal was whether the father had withdrawn and was unable to withdraw from his parent's charge at the time of the accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs payable by the father to the mother in the amount of $2,000 together with disbursements as taxed or agreed. The court was not persuaded that the judge erred in concluding that the child had not withdrawn and that it was his intention to further his education at a post-secondary educational institution."
d_2005nsca71.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. The court disbelieved his evidence, principally because it was found to be internally inconsistent. The court found that the appellant had attempted to portray himself as being good to the children but had admitted on cross-examination that the children had been removed from the home due to allegations of physical abuse and lack of food. There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","The appellant appeals his conviction by Crawford, J.P.C. on a charge of sexual assault. The appellant testified at trial denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant argued that his conviction is a miscarriage of justice because the judge based her rejection of his testimony on material misapprehensions of the evidence. He also submits that the judge found him to be a liar because he claimed to have been good to the children when he was responsible for physically abusing and starving them. HELD: The conviction is set aside and a new trial ordered. 1) The court found that the court misapprehended the evidence on this point by failing to give proper effect to it. 2) The judge's reasons for rejecting the appellant's evidence were based on misapplication of evidence. The judge ascribed to the evidence about the involvement of Children's Services, relevance that it simply could not have. The inference drawn from this evidence could not be more unjustified. 3) The trial judge misapplied evidence. It may consist of a mistake as to substance or in logic, but in the circumstances of this case the judge's reasoning reveals a chain of reasoning not available to the judge in law or to logic on this record.  4) In the circumstances the court concluded that the appellant must show two things: 1) that his evidence that the children had been removed amidst allegations of abuse was substantial; and 2) that it was an essential part of his reasoning leading to the conviction."

Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.","The plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle at the time of the accident when she was struck from behind. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence that there were no brake lights on the defendant's vehicle, it would still be a haphazard guess to assess whether or not the plaintiffs injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in her suffering injuries. Defence also argued that the plaintiff ought not to be successful in her application for summary judgment because she has not been able to establish that her injuries were not caused by the accident. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It is not the function of the court in determining the matter of an interim payment to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them. The plaintiff must rebut a presumption that the collision occurred as a result of his negligence. 2)There was no 'air of reality' to the defence. 3)The affidavit evidence showed a significant amount of other factors relating to the health of the plaintiff including her prior conditions which resulted in any on going inability of her to work in any capacity. 4)The plaintiff's affidavit evidence was examined without the benefit of any examination or cross- examination. 5)It was necessary for the defendant in his pleadings or by way of affidavit or other evidence to assert facts capable, if proven at trial, of rebutting the presumption the collision resulted in his negligence and the bald statement in the pleadings did not disclose the existence of an actual or probable defence and could not fend off an application for summarily. 6)Costs in the cause of the action were directed to the defendant."
d_2006nsca124.txt,"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent, who challenged the validity of a search warrant issued by her judge regarding her grow operation. The judge quashed the warrant, finding that the warrant was valid and that the evidence obtained as result of the search was wrongly excluded. The Crown appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge erred in law by misapplying the standard of review established in R. v. Garofoli for the review of an information to obtain search warrant and in failing to place appropriate weight upon the evidence gathered by the confidential informant when evaluating the sufficiency of the warrant. The court found that even had the warrant been quashed, the findings of the FLIR testing and the observations about the covered windows would not have been strong enough to overcome the weaknesses in the source's information. In this case, the court substituted its view of the evidence for that of the issuing judge, which was an error of law."

HELD: The matter will be remitted to the Rentalsman for a rehearing upon proof of service of the Notice of Hearing on all of the tenants.  1) The tenants who are named in the decision are Vernon and Ivy. There is no reference to Richie whose name appears on the tenancy agreement. 2) Even though the decision states that the Notice of Hearing was properly served, that cannot be the end of the matter given that there is nothing in the file which would indicate any directions having been given to the landlord with respect to service other than personal service. Ivy and Richie did not appear at the hearing and the decision does not even identify Richie as being one of the tenants. More is required to ensure service of and notice to all the tenants. 3) There are no notes nor is there anything in the decision which would permit the Court to conclude that the issue of service on Ivy and Richie was ever considered by the Rentalsman.

The issues were whether all the tenants had proper notice of the termination of the tenancy and the hearing, whether the landlord could give notice of termination without any cause, and whether the Rentalsmans could refuse to grant writ ofossession when there was an outstanding order from the Office of the Rentalalsman. HELD: The matter was remitted to the landlord to rehearing upon proof of service of the Notice of Hearing on all of the tenants. 1)The landlord failed to vacate the premises in accordance with s.25(1) of the Act.  2)The tenant failed to bring an application for possession. 3)The issue of service on the two tenants was not considered.  4)Although the notice of hearing was properly served, there was nothing in the file that would indicate any directions having been given with respect to service other than personal service.  5)The material available for review was limited to the notice served on the tenants and the documents filed.  6)It was impossible for the tenant to conclude that the issue of unpaid rent payments was ever considered. 7)It would be unfair to deprive the tenants of their opportunity to make their own living by failing to provide proper written notice.  8)The issues were as follows: whether the tenant must prove it would be just and equitable to grant a writ for possession; if so, what the relevance of the tenant's assertion that it did not have notice of this hearing; whether the issue was re-hearing on all tenants.  7)Costs were awarded to the tenant for rehearing."
d_2007skqb266.txt,"FIAT: The primary issue is whether the father should pay for tutoring expenses. HELD: 1) The father is not opposed to Kody receiving some additional educational assistance. However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400.","FIAT: The Court ordered a number of orders regarding child support as well as an order regarding summer access. The remaining issues were: what, if any, should the father pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children? The mother proposed that Kody be registered in the Sylvan Learning Centre during the summer of 2007 due to his educational difficulties. Although it was clear from the evidence that the mother had an entitlement to interim spousal support, the father did not have the ability to pay. HELD: 1)The child support application was made pursuant to s.15.3(1) of the Divorce Act. Section 7(1)(d) provides that the father is not entitled to retroactive child support. Although the mother and father acknowledge that they did commence making reasonable child support payments as of February 2007, it is clear that they have not taken any steps to research alternative programming. 2)Although the father will be stretched, the mother's evidence discloses that both children, but more particularly Kody, was in need of a specialized educational program given his current problems at school. The mother was required to bring this motion to obtain an appropriate sharing of s. expenses. The father was ordered to pay costs in the amount of $400. 3)The Sylvan learning centre expenses were necessary and reasonable. If the father paid this amount in addition to his s. child support amount, he would have net monthly cash flow of $1,066, while the mother would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. 4)The father was to pay his proportionate share of all Sylvan costs and fees equal to 71% of the total cost.  5)The Court ordered the father to contribute to the cost of the day-to-day care of Kody for the summer.  6)In the matter before the Court it was ordered that the costs of preparing an affidavit for each child be divided equally between the father's and mother's costs. 7)It was clear that although the father would be stretched and there was significant conflict on the evidence regarding the payment of loans by the father during this period of time, the issue of whether or not the mother refused to accept payments being offered was also at issue.

d_2009nssm48.txt,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","This was an appeal by the landlord from an order of the Director which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy, but also denied the landlord's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the tenant effectively refused to renew for another year. This was an interesting and perhaps important issue under residential tenancy law, and in particular what it means when a landlord has been directed not to withhold consent in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner. This is an appeal from an earlier court order which effectively allowed the tenant's request to convert the lease from year to month, to an earlier date, and to alleviate hardship he unconditionally undertaken to accept an early termination on any date from May 31, 2010 (his undertaking refers to 2009, but I believe that is a typo) until August 31 2010. The landlord appealed. Allowing the appeal, that the lease had not been converted into a monthly tenancy because the landlord refused to consent in a timely manner, for reasons beyond the control of either the landlord or the tenant, and because it was already too late to avoid hardship. The tenants had been operating in a state of uncertainty, not knowing the status of their tenancy, and the tenant had no inclination to give in."

The issue is whether the evidence of the Crown is sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the offence of common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Court did not know who to believe and he was not found guilty of this offence. The evidence established that the accused had jumped, slipped or fell from the complainant's grasp while removing the baby from the Jolly Jumper. The complainant went to slam the door in frustration at how matters had unfolded to which he reacted with a blow. None of the material witnesses testified which undermined credibility. The accused bore no onus whatsoever in that regard. The determination of credibility does not involve the Court opting for one version of events or the other. Rather, the Crown must prove that its evidence is credible. Even if the Court prefers to use the Crown, it must still consider whether the case for the defence raises reasonable doubt. The credibility of material witnesses needs to be considered, in that context. The Crown's evidence was not credible. It was also not credible in that there were no other witnesses in the bedroom at the time."

Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so. While a dismissal of the criminal appeal is a serious remedy, since it means it will never be heard on its merits, the appellant has made it clear that she cannot provide certified transcripts unless the court orders the respondents to pay. The court has already declined to do so. There is no suggestion a further extension of time will result in the appellant perfecting the appeal.","The appellant appealed the June 29, 2011 decision of the Criminal Appeal Court which held that she had committed the act of public mischief when she reported an offence of assault with weapon to an RCMP officer, causing him to enter an investigation, when the alleged offence had not been committed and she was not criminally responsible with respect to this charge. The appellant applied to have the respondents pay for the preparation and certification of the 1,700 pages of transcript she wanted to put before the Court on her 2nd and 3rd appeals. The respondents' motions to dismiss her Criminal Appeal and to have them pay to certify the transcripts were granted. HELD: The Court dismissed the appellant's two appeals for failure to perfect.  1) The appellant had not filed her materials on time. The personal circumstances she describes are difficult. But there is no suggestion they will change. She is complying with the filing she is required to do in order to get her appeal to the point where it can be dealt with by this Court.  2) The Court also dismissed the respondent's motions to have all of the transcriptions certified by the Court for the purpose of compiling a complete transcript. It would be unsafe to rely on uncertified transcripts. The suggestion at the end of the hearing that perhaps she could ask legal aid to pay for these pages is not realistic. 3) The respondents were ordered to pay the cost of certifying the transcripts."

MLG was unable to explain how cross-examination would assist the Court.

d_2016skpc75.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay. As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered. The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay. The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable.","The accused, charged with 56 offences, including conspiracy to commit the indictable offence of fraud by printing and/or cashing forged cheques, being in breach of s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, defrauding or attempting to defraud contrary to section 4(1) of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession of a counterfeit mark, contrary to s. 553 of the Code. The accused sought a judicial stay of proceedings alleging that his right to a fair trial had been infringed. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)The accused had not established on a balance of probabilities that there had been a breach of his rights to be tried within a reasonable time.  2)The Court distinguished between the interests of society as a whole and those of the general public. It found that society had an interest in seeing that the least fortunate of its citizens who are accused of crimes are treated humanely and fairly. In this respect trials held promptly enjoy the confidence of the public. As the seriousness of the offence increases so does the societal demand that the accused be brought to trial. In some cases, however, the accused has not established that there has been an unreasonable delay in the trial process. 3)Individual rights and FreedomsThe accused has no interest in an early trial and society's interest will not parallel that of the accused."

Allowing the appeal in part, that the Court of Appeal should return a direction in the direction of the Chief Justice of the court of appeal to review the 679 application. In this case, the appellant was not in custody and the decision was misinterpreted. The Crown relied upon its submission that the appellant, who was on parole when the application for release was made, was in custody within the meaning of s.679.

The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence.

The Crown alleged that Brooks consented to the possession of the drugs in the trunk of the Lincoln because she was a party to a designated substance offence. Brooks denied having any knowledge of the substance offence and asserted that the drugs were not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. HELD: The Lincoln was found to be owned by Brooks.

She had stayed overnight in Calgary and was with her husband in hotel. It appears from the affidavit that she was loading our luggage in to the Lincoln that it was not their first overnight stay. It is quite impossible to conclude that Brooks is the owner of the vehicle. It has not been questioned that she has an interest in it. 4)The affidavit deposed that she saw something on the floor of the front seat that indicated something that might have been used to commit the offence and that she exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied that the property was not meant to be utilized. 5)Compromised testimony of the RCMP officer was not adduced at trial. 6)There was no evidence to rebut the affidavit."

HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","The plaintiff sought damages for injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The plaintiff's affidavit asserted that she was in the produce department of the store at approximately 3:45 pm. She was bandaged, given painkillers and advised to rest and see her family doctor if her injuries did not improve. Some of the injuries she claimed occurred as a result of her slip and fall appeared to have been in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff. 2)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water or produce on the floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. The defendant did not know the water was there but did know that water and other substances could be on the Floor of the Produce Department and also knew that reasonable steps must be taken to safeguard against the very type of accident experienced by the general public. 3)There were no errors by the defendant in law enforcement. 4)The plaintiff met the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water in the store. Her injuries appeared to be at least in part in part caused by the defendants' negligence in maintaining a clean and hygienic cleaning regime. 5)The defendants did not file separate affidavits or admit liability. The affidavits were inconsistent with the physician notes and medical reports filed in evidence and with information elicited during cross-examination. 6)Costs were awarded to the plaintiff for the costs of the appeal."

The refusal charge was dismissed and the appellant was convicted of impaired driving. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The evidence of impairment was too weak to convict the appellant. The officer told the accused that if he passed the ALERT test, he would be sent on his way.

e_2004nspc8.txt,"The defendant applied for a stay of proceedings on the basis of a violation of his right to be tried in a reasonable time. There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial. Stay of proceedings granted. At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.","This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter. The accused was charged with exceeding the Breathalyzer and impaired driving. He was arraigned on the information and requested the first available date for trial. The Defense had verballyized an intention to raise s. 8 and s. 9 Charter motions and lead evidence. HELD: The application was stayed.  1)The length of the delay was well outside the 8-10 month guideline established by the Supreme Court of Canada. 2)The applicant asserted his right to a speedy trial by requesting a first available trial date. He retained counsel and was prepared to fight the merits of the case at trial. It cannot be said that he deliberately or otherwise was attempting to escape trial on the merits. 3)Prejudice to the accused may be inferred. The length of delay is likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered given the passage of time that has occurred since the charges were filed. 4)There is no evidence before this court that institutional delay of 13 months is the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges and the technical nature of breathalyzer law, the fact that the Defense has verbalized an intent to raise ss. 8, s.9, and S.9 Charter motions (and lead evidence) can lead to delay or otherwise cause delay. 5)There was no evidence that the applicant waived any rights, explicitly or implicitly. The applicant retained and instructed counsel, entered his plea at arraignment and set the matter for trial and it is done by balancing the interests the system is designed to protect against.  6)There could be no greater frustration imaginable for innocent persons charged with an offence than to be denied the opportunity of demonstrating their innocence for an unconscionable time as a result of unreasonable delays in their trial. Where the Crown demonstrates that there was no prejudice to any accused flowing from the delay, such proof may serve to excuse the delay. 7)The court must do is to determine judicially whether the delay is unreasonable. There is a community or societal interest implicit in s.11(b). That community interest has a dual dimension. The longer the delay the easier it may be for the court to infer prejudice. 8)This is an aspect of fundamental justice guaranteed by s.7 of The Charter. 9)Individual and societal interests at play"

e_2004skpc82.txt,"The accused youth is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions. However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.","The accused was charged that he did operate a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug, contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges.  1)The accused did not show any signs of impairment. His blood alcohol concentration was at or near.08. 2)The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong smell of alcohol and a flushed face. 3)The Court concluded that in the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for these tests, the proper method of application and to comment on their relative reliability, it was not appropriate for the court to rely upon them on the issue of guilt or innocence to the prejudice of the accused. 4)On the Crown evidence, the accused was operating his vehicle in light traffic. He was exceeding the speed limit and had failed to signal lane changes, which he made in an abrupt manner as he passed the only other vehicle in the immediate vicinity. The vehicle wandered somewhat within its lane, but did not stray into the other lane of traffic. 5)Although the accused's response in stopping was delayed, he braked abruptly and the opportunity to make the observations was only during roughly 2 minutes. The accused suggested that his blood alcohol consumption may have been the result of some recent marijuana use and that his eyes were not flushed. 6)The court found that the accused had not shown any symptoms of impairment contrary to the standard of care prescribed by s.253(a). 7)There was no evidence offered as a reasonable explanation for his failure to comply with the sobriety tests. The Court found that it was unlikely that he had any problems with balance, but rather that he was moving in slow and deliberate manner. 8)The evidence of impairment was not offered as an explanation for the failure to provide a reasonable inference as to impairment based on the evidence. 9)It was not reasonable to expect the accused to be acquitted on the basis of the evidence offered by the Crown. 10)In assessing credibility, the Court held that the Crown must carefully review all of the reported tests and observations which inferentially support or negate any impairment of a person's mental and physical capabilities, and then be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom establish a reasonable impairment to the degree prescribed by ss.253 and 255 of the Code."

HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict. 2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant. The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered. The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct. The offence of dangerous driving was established and the accused was found guilty. 4) The accused was found guilty of two counts of assault.",The accused was charged with two counts of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and one count of attempting to strike the complainant with a motor vehicle thereby committing aggravated assault.

e_2005skpc8.txt,"The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged that he committed a sexual assault on the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1) The complainant was employed as clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and although she testified that she knew the accused in 1999, it was much more likely that she met him in the spring of 2002 after he assumed his duties as Justice of the Peace in the same building. The Court found that the accused had not been detained and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been infringed. 2) The accused gave an honest and straightforward fashion. She was vigorously cross-examined. While her recollection was not perfect and her evidence was not consistent on every point, believe that she did her best to relate her evidence as accurately as she could.  3) It was necessary that certain findings of credibility be made in this case. The evidence of T.D. was examined. The accused's evidence was that he did not take the complainant's hand and guide it to his groin, that he squeezed his penis for a second and that she expected him to remove his hand from hers. He did not specifically tell her to stop making the comments but she did recall that he asked her if she wanted to have oral sex. She did not respond. 4) The Court of Appeal was of the view that, on the evidence that accept, the Crown has proven the elements of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt."
e_2006skqb231.txt,"The plaintiff applies for certification pursuant to The Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight from the Dominican Republic to Regina. The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties. The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action.

The flight was delayed for about an hour and half at the Punta Cana airport as a result of several evolving mechanical difficulties referred to by the pilot as 'creeping delay'. The defendants opposed the certification application on the basis that none of the five criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act had been met by the applicant. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1)The test to be applied in certification applications is similar to those used in applications to strike statement of claim as disclosing no cause of action. All allegations of fact pleaded are to be accepted as true and secondly, pleadings will only be struck if it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs cannot succeed. The court should be reluctant to deny plaintiff his or her day in court. 2)Although no specific case law was provided to the Court with regard to the Montreal Convention of 1999, there is ample case law with regard its predecessor, the Warsaw Convention, as to its exclusive remedy for passengers. Those cases include Connaught Laboratories Ltd. v. British Airways, 2002 CanLII 4642 (ON SC), 217 D.L.R. (4th) 717 (Ont. S.C.J.), and Wirth v. Airline Pilots Association (1) which involved a claim against a commercial airline and package tour operator arising from a crash landing. Although the plaintiff was given until March 2006 to file a case law on the narrow issue of the meaning of 'bodily injury' within Article 17 of the Montreal convention, it was given the opportunity to present further oral argument.  3)The generous approach to be adopted on this application is specifically spelled out in S. 4(2)(a). The court may adjourn the application for certification to permit the parties to amend their materials or pleadings or to permit further evidence to be introduced. 4)Although the onus is on the plaintiffs, on certification application, to satisfy the Court that the pleadings disclose cause of actions, it is not very high onus."
e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. The only evidence led in the voir dire at the trial was that of the police officer who had stopped the respondent in a routine traffic stop of vehicles entering Saskatoon from the east. After the officer determined that he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe the respondent was operating his motor vehicle while impaired, he arrested the respondent, read the respondent his right to retain counsel and gave the requisite police warning. The Certificate of Analysis was excluded. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge failed to address the real issue of whether the respondent had a waiver of the right to counsel by virtue of the lack of Prosper warning. In reviewing the evidence that was before the trial judge, the judge could not have reasonably reached the conclusion he did. Not only does this case have no comparison to the facts in R. v. Prosper, the evidence falls far short of proving that the Respondent was frustrated. Impatient, probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about 5 minutes. The police will be required to tell the detainee of his rights to reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and of the obligation on the part of police during this time to refrain from having them participate in any process that would incriminate him.  2) The respondent has not waiver of his right of free legal advice. The Crown has not shown that the respondent gave an unequivocal waiver when he changed his mind about seeking legal counsel. 3) There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. The failure of the Crown to disclose the existence and availability of the applicable systems of duty counsel and Legal Aid in the province to the respondent is a serious breach of that right. 4) The Court must examine the evidence to determine whether the Crown has met the burden of establishing that the respondents gave an unambiguous waiver when they changed their mind. The waiver must be free and voluntary and it must not be the product of either direct or indirect compulsion. 5) The evidence shows that a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer to inform that detainee that he has a right to consult with him/her on any potentially incriminating process until he has had that reasonable opportunity."
e_2006skqb534.txt,"The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.","HISTORICAL REVIEW: The respondent applies to vary child support orders and/or the alleged agreement struck by the petitioner and the respondent in or about July 2003. The respondent seeks to vary pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act and s. 10 of The Family Maintenance Act. In addition to a variation of the amount of child support, the respondent asks that the variation order apply retroactively to July 1, 2003.  1) There is no evidence that an agreement was struck. The petitioner and respondent agreed in 1999 that the respondent would continue to have joint custody of the children. However, in 1997 the respondent made an informal adjustment to monthly child support to become $380.00 per month. This became the prevailing course of conduct without the formality of either court order or formal agreement. 2) The petitioner did not engage in blameworthy conduct. The annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 3) There was no agreement or obligation to disclose the tax return on June 30, 2004 and each June 30 thereafter as the respondent alleged. 4) The respondent was content to accept $380 per month as fair level of support for both children.  5) In a situation where there has been a change in circumstances the petitioner must be presumed to have fulfilled her support obligation towards her children, it will be open for court to vary an existing order retroactively. The consequence will be that amounts that should have been paid earlier will become immediately enforceable.  6) The court cannot find any reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that he accepted less than the respondent accepted."

The Court put significant weight on the offender's continued disregard of court orders and fact that the number and severity of the assault incidents is increasing."
e_2008nssc216.txt,"The applicant school teacher asked to be discharged from $20k in student loan debts under s.178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. He had filed consumer proposal in 2001, which he completed successfully in 2006. He earned $50,874 (gross) per annum; was at the top of his pay scale; had two young children; and his wife worked half-time position at Aliant, earning $16,272 year. There were daycare costs when the wife worked, and the applicant's transportation costs were high (but reasonable). The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards. The applicant did not have any credit either. Their home had little, if any, equity. The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan. Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability. If the application were refused, he would have to consider bankruptcy.",Applicant asks for an order under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act that does not apply to his outstanding student loan debt. The application is opposed by the Attorney General of Canada. HELD: 1) The applicant has and will continue to experience financial difficulty to such an extent that (he) will be unable to pay his liabilities for the loan. The debt in effect can either be cancelled or affirmed. 2) Using the Superintendent's Standards he may have a monthly surplus of about $170. It would take many years for him to contribute enough to significantly reduce this liability.
e_2009nssc204.txt,"An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment. The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","The appellant was a student at St. Francis Xavier University when he sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the professor did not take the content of the attachment as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to the professor to cause his death, contrary to s.264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The appellant did not have a lawyer when he stood his trial in May 2008 in Provincial Court. He was found guilty and was sentenced immediately following the conclusion of his trial to an 18 month suspended sentence, and placed on probation with conditions. Counsel was retained and an appeal commenced from conviction and sentence, alleging improper admission of evidence, unfair and prejudicial cross-examination of the appellant and a failure to give due consideration to a conditional discharge. New counsel took over carriage of the appeal. The trial judge did not address any of the instances of prejudicial or hearsay evidence that came in through the witness."
e_2009skca40.txt,"This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","This was an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant sought to set aside the transaction under various heads of contract law including duress, undue influence, unconscionability, equitable fraud and mistake. The facts briefly are that the appellant, a widow, agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including a residence and some grain bins, to the respondents, the Clements, by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000 allocated $100,000 for the land and $20,000. The terms were indeed favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over 7 years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and property taxes until December 31, 2006. The issues raised were factual and the standard of review in H.L. v. Canada had been met. The trial judge concluded that the plaintiff, when she entered the contract, had full capacity. She saw no reason on the evidence to doubt her competence and that is fully supported by her testimony at the trial when she was in her late 80's."
e_2010skca79.txt,"The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. The appellant appealed his convictions and his sentence, arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter was too severe. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons.  1) The issues identified by the appellant do not operate to make his convictions unreasonable. The trial judge warned the jury about the dangers of eye witness identification evidence. She underscored that an honest and apparently convincing witness can be mistaken on identification issues. 2) When the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not in any way left with the impression that, if the appellant could have outrun the Constable, this would suggest that he was the driver of the Tempo.  3) The appellant's argument that the trial judge left the jury with an erroneous sense of their significance was not supported by the fact the appellant had been driving the vehicle at the time of the offence or by any of the other grounds raised by the appeal. The appeal court was unable to conclude that the appellant's convictions were unreasonable in light of the evidence such as the foregoing."
e_2011skqb134.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of using credit card data to fraudulently obtain services contrary to s. 342(3) of the Criminal Code, one count of fraud over $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1) of the Criminal Code for defrauding Sasktel of telephone services and one count of fraudulently personating various persons with intent to gain advantage for himself contrary to s. 403(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences. The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names. He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services. The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44. The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items. The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18. The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail. He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders. In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities. He plead guilty. HELD: A fit sentence in global terms for these offences would be 8 years and 6 months. The accused was given credit for 4 years and 9 months for the time he spent in custody. The accused was sentenced to 2 years and 3 months for the s. 342(3) offence, 1 year and 6 months consecutive for the offence under s. 380(1) and 2 years concurrent for the personation offence under s. 403(a). The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","The accused was charged with two counts of fraud. The Crown stayed the count and imposed a global sentence of eight years and six months. The accused plead guilty to three counts of theft. The sentences were varied to correspond to the gravity of the offence, the time actually served on remand. HELD: The global sentence was reduced to four years and nine months from the total of 10 years and 9 months. 1) The accused pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud Saskatchewan Telecommunications of services and goods of a value exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and one count for fraudulently obtaining goods and services by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means. 2) The offence was very high because of a number of aggravating circumstances. There clearly was pre-meditation and careful planning in advance. Several other people were implicated in the criminal enterprise. The two schemes were pursued over a lengthy period of time and involved scores of transactions. There were many individuals and businesses subjected to embarrassment and anxiety. 3) The Court gave the accused a credit for time served of 1,336 days for that period. 4) The credit was one for one, or put otherwise, the amount actually served by the accused. The credit should be one for both, or two, or less, and the global sentence should be reduced accordingly.  5) There was a credit of 4 years, 9 months and the credit remained with me despite s. 719(3) and (4). The discretion to grant the credit was with the Court despite s719(4) and(4), because the offences were committed and the charges brought before the enactment of the section.  6) The Crown did not meet the criteria for a fit global sentence as it had not satisfied the criteria set out in the Code. 7) Denunciation and deterrence, both of the accused and others, must be emphasized and obtain a priority. Any other approach would be counterproductive."
e_2011skqb244.txt,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","The appellant appealed his conviction for impaired care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit of.08 contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count, namely that the central Crown witness provided exculpatory evidence, which the learned trial judge did not accept. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction was upheld. 1)The trial judge made express findings of credibility concerning the evidence of the two police officers who were notified of the appellant's symptoms of impairment prior to being informed of his right to counsel. The observations were not part of conscripted evidence which would place the administration of justice into disrepute in a Charter analysis. 2)Although the appellant was acquitted of both charges, his conviction was based substantially on an express finding of impairment. There was nothing in the record to indicate there was any inherent improbability in his evidence or any other basis which would justify interference by the Crown with the findings of impairment on the charge of impaired driving. The learned judge made no errors in his considerations concerning the credibility of the witnesses."
e_2011skqb444.txt,"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and common assault. The Court found that the accused’s actions were done in self-defence. Given that the video evidence and the testimony of corrections officers, it was not legally necessary to establish that the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the injuries caused to the victim fell within the definition of wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life. The accused”s position in the trial was based on the concept of “parties to the offence”, “principal offender” and secondary offender. The three elements of s. 34(2) have both subjective and objective components: (1) the accused reasonably believed that he was assaulted; (2) that he caused the injuries to Dorion; (3) that his belief in himself was objectively reasonable on the basis of the situation that he perceives; and (4) that knife believed on reasonable grounds that he could not otherwise preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm at the hands of Dorion. In all of the circumstances, the Crown established that bodily harm was objectively foreseeable by the accused as a consequence to the plot to which he was a party. The court reviewed the various pieces of evidence and concluded that the existence of an actual assault was not a prerequisite for the defence under s.34(2). All three elements must be established: the subjective perception of the accused, the objective foresight of specific wounds, and the fact that his group moved in unison with the purpose of attacking the victim."
e_2012skpc161.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","The accused pleaded guilty to aggravated assault thereby endangering the life of the victim contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence that he report to his youth worker, contrary to ss. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The Crown applied under s. 42(9) for a determination that the aggravated assault be designated as a serious violent offence. The accused was sentenced to a secure custodial sentence of 24 months to be followed by a period of probation with credit for pre-sentence detention, 6 months of community supervision and 6 months community supervision. On the sentences imposed, the accused was ordered to provide a DNA sample to be included in the DNA database and on the sentences set out in s. 487.051 of the YCJA, the young person was prohibited from possessing firearms, having completed his Grade education and appearing before the Youth Justice Court whenever required to do so by the Youth Worker or the Youth Court Worker; he was to receive credit for 12 months on the offences of breach of undertaking, breach of an undertaking to keep the peace and be of good behaviour, failing to obtain a probation order, or receiving a weapon prohibition order contrary to either s. 138(3) or s. 137. The defence did not oppose the application for a DNA order or weapons prohibition order. HELD: The accused is a young person with a high risk of re-offence, who has extreme and violent offending and is at high risk to offend again. Given the accused's extreme violent response, it is clear that this young person would be best served by a sentence of at least one year, followed by periods of probation and then, in the context of a weapons offence, by a concurrent sentence of probation, which would follow his sentence of 12 months. A period of custody was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. The Court found that the accused had little confidence that he would succeed in his rehabilitation and reintegration into society. As a result of the assault, the victim will be permanently disabled by the time he is sentenced; the accused will be required to participate in programming for substance abuse, as recommended by Dr. Quinn and the youth worker; he is prohibited from having contact with any of the co-accused's children during the time they are in detention; he will be unable to run his business during his time in detention and he will suffer from memory loss."

The plaintiff is chartered accountant who was partner with the defendant. 2000 merger agreement signed by the plaintiff indicated that the Courts of Saskatchewan would have exclusive jurisdiction to determine all disputes between the parties. After the merger, the plaintiff signed new partnership agreement that said arbitration would apply to any disputes between partner and the partnership. HELD: The action was stayed pending arbitration. The plaintiff's statement of claim does not rely on the 2000 merger agreement, the claim is based solely on the new partnership agreement and alleges breaches of the partnership agreement. The partnership agreement clearly states that disputes are to be resolved through arbitration.","FIAT: The defendant seeks a stay of the action pursuant to s. 8 of The Arbitration Act, 1992. The plaintiff was a chartered accountant. He joined the partnership of MNP and became subject to the partnership agreement until June 1, 1999. In 1999, MNP gave notice to the plaintiff that his partnership arrangement would be terminated effective September 30, 2009. On May 10, 2011, the plaintiff's solicitor sent a letter to the C.E.O., which served as formal notice to Laidlaw that he required his dispute with Meyers Norris Penny LLP to be referred to arbitration. In November 2011 the plaintiff commenced claim against MNP. Relevant portions of the claim are: 6. Effective September 1st, 2000, the respondent was admitted as a principal partner of the MNP, subject to terms and conditions of the Partnership Agreement. The merger agreement provided the courts of Saskatchewan would have exclusive jurisdiction to determine all disputes and claims arising between the parties. The MNP filed a motion to stay the action pending the commencement of arbitration of that proceeding. HELD: The action is stayed pursuant to ss. 8(1) and s. 24.1. The parties agree that the arbitration agreement is invalid and the subject matter of the dispute is not capable of being the subject of arbitration pursuant to Saskatchewan law; the motion was brought with undue delay; the matter is proper one for default or summary judgment.  1) The parties acknowledge that the Partnership entered into and is bound by the terms of the November 7, 2000 agreement which are listed on Appendix D, which is attached to and forms part of the agreement. The issue must be decided by the courts, not the arbitrator. 2) There are no other provisions in the Act that apply to this situation that may result in the refusal of the stay of proceedings. 3) The Court does not have to deal with the issue on the question of relevance.

e_2013skca1.txt,"The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The chambers judge dismissed the application and certified the action as a class action against all defendants. The proposed appellants sought an order pursuant to Rule 173(c) of The Queen's Bench Rules striking the within action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and non-client. Consequently, no common issue existed upon which a certified class action could reasonably be certified. The respondents also objected to the certification on the grounds that it conflicted with the Ann's test and the tax opinions provided by the respondent were not to be given to prospective investors. They also argued that the Chambers judge erred in law by failing to properly apply the Anns test, which requires a review of the underlying documents and agreements. Dismissing the application with the exception of the tax opinion, which was not filed by the respondents, was prima facie destined to fail and not of sufficient merit to warrant the attention of the Court of Appeal. The Chambers judge made no errors in law or in his interpretation of the facts, nor in his analysis of the interplay between the rules and the commonality rules of the Class Actions Act."
e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent seeks to expunge child support arrears that have accumulated as a result of his not paying child support for many years. He is 72 years old and practising internal medicine and rheumatology in the United States. The petitioner is on long term disability. She is on a long-term disability. The respondent is paying $1,683 in monthly child support pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines and $249 per month in s. expenses. HELD: 1) The respondent will have a few lean years until he has paid off the remainder of child support. He wants to prepare for his retirement. Almost every dollar that was applied to child support was taken from the respondent by garnishment process or the interception of federal government monies directed to him. He did not pay child support willingly it had to be snatched away from him.  2) Considering the respondent's pattern of non-payment, the onus is on the respondent to establish on a balance of probabilities that he cannot now pay and will not in the future be able to pay the child support owed. He does not accept that assertion. His child support obligations have mounted considerably over the years and, in some cases, it might be appropriate to reduce them because of the passage of time. It is repugnant to even suggest that child support should be reduced. It has not changed. The law as it pertains to the imputed income of a payor remains unchanged. Income was imputed to the respondent in the amount of $177,000 and he was ordered to pay $2,745 per month for an annual surplus of $109,912. 3) The Court cannot find that the respondent does not have the ability to pay. Considering the above the respondent made his mistake that his child support obligation ceased as at October 2004, it has been calculated to be $183,746. 4) The petitioner has struggled for 25 years to get the father to pay support. She was not very successful. She had to resort to welfare to provide for the children. 5) The father is putting money away for retirement. He has been collecting child support since 2001 and he has spent money that he did not expect to be paid. He cannot afford to spend time in debt to support his children. The court cannot attribute this to the father. The father's conduct is blameworthy. It does not change the fact that he has been paying support for the past 12 years and he does not appear to have made any effort to"
e_2016skpc30.txt,"HELD: The accused was granted a curative discharge. The court found that the accused had met the required onus of this type of application in accordance with R. v. Ahenakew. The accused’s conduct over the past 18 months satisfied the court on the balance of probabilities that hers was an exceptional case and that a curative discharge would not be contrary to the public interest. The court imposed numerous conditions on her, including that she could not have or consume alcohol and should report to a probation officer, receive addiction counselling, participate in AA meetings and provide proof of her attendance to her probation officer. Her driver’s license was cancelled and she was prohibited from driving for two years.","The accused entered guilty plea to one count of driving a motor vehicle while her blood alcohol content was over 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and asked to be granted a curative discharge pursuant to s. 255(5) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The Court found that the accused was in need of treatment to deal with her alcohol consumption and addiction. She had two prior convictions for drinking and driving and had been through the Impaired Driver Treatment Centre in 2010. Pursuant to the terms of her probation and licence, she was prohibited from driving on any street, road, highway or other public place for two years, commencing today. The surcharge of $100 was ordered to be paid on or before June 30, 2016."
e_2017skqb219.txt,"HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent. They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.","The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother of the two children. The grandmother argues she is person of sufficient interest with respect to the children. She seeks an order that she and the father have joint custody of the children but her home be the children's primary residence. The father is not opposed to the grandmother having reasonable and liberal access.HELD: 1) There is an interim order designating the grandmother as a personof sufficient interest on an interim basis. This designation was made pursuant to s. 6 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 and is equally applicable when a family member pursues custody. 2) It is clear there were concerns regarding the father's use of alcohol and drugs. However, the grandmother testified that she had always been his primary caregiver. 3) The father has always been in the grandmother's home. It is also clear from the photographs that the father is involved in many activities with the children that the grandmother is also his primary caretaker. 4) In relation to the issues of access and custody, the court must consider a variety of factors including the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and quality of the relationship between the father and the children, how the relationship with the child was represented to the world and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. 5) There are five people currently residing in the home. The Court of Appeal was dealing with a request by a third party for interim custody. He sought a declaration that he was the father of the three boys and that his access to the boys should continue to occur every second weekend. He was absent for approximately four years. The parties could have obtained an order for substitutional service on the grandmother."
