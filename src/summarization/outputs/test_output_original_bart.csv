0,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Conclusion Document : ,"This was the second bankruptcy for the same bankrupt. The sole unsecured creditor was Revenue Canada with a proved claim of $89,000 for unpaid income tax and unremitted G.S.T. It should come as no surprise that Revenue Canada was also the major creditor in the first bankruptcy. The bankrupt had a horrendous record for non-payment of his tax obligations which stretched back at least 15 years. The objecting creditor calculated surplus income at $750 and requested a four year conditional order providing for monthly payments of $750. HELD: The bankrupt can accommodate a payment of $500 per month for three years without jeopardizing his ability to pay toward his current tax obligations. An order will be made requiring the bankrupt to pay to the trustee the sum of $18,000 by monthly instalments   until paid in full. Judgement interest will accrue on any payment in arrears. The right of prepayment exists. Since the bankrupt denies any knowledge of his obligation to make regular instalment payments on his self-employment income the court would be remiss if did not offer the court's assistance to educate him.","The bankrupt was self-employed and failed to pay his taxes, owing Revenue Canada $89,000. The trustee calculated surplus income at $435 per month and recommended a conditional order of discharge requiring the payment of $7,800. Revenue Canada objected, requesting a conditional order for monthly payments of $750 over 4 years. HELD: Conditional order of discharge granted. The court found that the bankrupt was 43 years old, in good health and with no dependents. The bankrupt was also a self-employed contractor with an 'enviable' income. Following a review of the bankrupt's financial material on file, the court ordered the bankrupt to pay $500 per month for 3 years, to make regular installment payments on his self-employment income and comply with tax filing requirements."

The applicant sought an order pursuant to ss.87 and 251 of The Land Titles Act cancelling the existing Certificate of Title in the name of the deceased and issuing a new one in their joint names with a right of survivorship. The deceased was married to the respondent and died intestate. The respondent did not present any evidence disputing the facts as set out on behalf of the applicant. She did, however, oppose the requested order. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the estate in any event of the cause. 1)It is well settled law that applications for vesting orders under s.87(a) of the Act should be made when (i) the facts are not in dispute, (ii) there is no question as to the reasonably convenient remedy or relief sought, and (iii) there are no other available or procedure for giving relief. In Re. Ralph Estate (1954), 12 W.R.W. (N.S.) affirmed the principles to consider under s87(b) as well as in Re. McFee (1997), CanLII (1956). 2)The applicant was awarded costs of the application against the respondent.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.87 and s.251 of the Land Titles Act cancelling the existing certificate of Title in the names of the deceased and herself as tenants in common and directing the Land Titles Registrar to issue a new title in their joint names with right of survivorship. The deceased and applicant who had been living together purchased residential property in 1997. Their lawyer prepared a written agreement for the sellers and purchasers as well as the mortgage describing the purchasers as joint tenants. The sellers, unrepresented by legal counsel, prepared the transfer of the property and title issued without the words 'joint tenants'. The error describing the purchasers went unnoticed by their lawyer. The respondent had been married to the deceased when he died intestate in 1998. As the title stood an undivided one-half interest was owned by the estate and would devolve to the respondent pursuant to the Intestate Succession Act. HELD: The Land Titles Office Registrar was to amend the existing certificate of title by inserting 'joint tenants' after the names of the registered owners. 1)The requirements set out in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Rochon were satisfied. There was an obvious mistake which required rectification. The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did. 2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other."
2,Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Reason Document : ,"Three separate actions were commenced following the death of the respondent professor in 1997. The first involved a Proof in Solemn Form action. The second action was commenced by Dr. Gurpreet Sandhu, who claimed to be the son of the deceased professor and sought entitlement to his late father's estate. The third action was taken by Inderjeet, the wife of the late professor. Following certain pre-trial communications among counsel and discovery examinations of important witnesses, it became obvious that there were circumstances surrounding the wills and death which might reasonably be considered suspicious. By consent, proof in solemn form would be required, with the case to be tried by a Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, sitting in Probate. Jurisdiction to hear such a case flows from the Probate Act, and is based on the historic statutory, common law and equity authorities of the probate court, a pre-confederation court modelled on the English Probate Court. With respect to the relief claimed by the second and third actions, respectively, pursuant to the Testators' Family Maintenance Act and the Matrimonial Property Act, the matter was reserved to the Court of Queen's Bench. These matters cannot be combined into one action or proceeding. They may be heard together with the consent of all parties and the approval of the presiding judge, acting in both his Probate and Supreme Court roles, but they remain separate, jurisdictional proceedings. To put these claims in context, one must recall the extraordinary life of the subject professor. The evidence at trial could often be compared to the novel or Truth and Lies character in the film The Butler's Run. HELD: The Court held that the evidence placed before the hearing might be applied to all three proceedings and that a single hearing of all issues was necessary to avoid repetition of viva voce testimony and duplication of effort.","A wife claimed part of the estate of her estranged husband. The Court considered the applicability of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act, the Matrimonial Property Act, and the Pension Benefits Act. Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate, that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed. To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator. This involves a very broad judicial discretion. Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance."
3,Issue | Conclusion | Reason Document : ,"This was an appeal by the Director of Assessment from a decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board. The Board had previously held that it did have jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The Director argued that the Board did not have jurisdiction because the respondent had failed to serve notice on the municipality clerk as required by s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act. Dismissing the appeal, that although the Board had not complied with the statutory requirement respecting service on the Municipality, that party expressly waived its right to notice by notice required by the Act. That principle of waiver was recognized by the Court in Accept Accept Limited v. Fisher Limited.","The appellant appealed a preliminary decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board which held that it had jurisdiction to hear an assessment appeal where, although the appellant failed to comply with the service requirement of s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act, the party not properly served waived the requirement. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that where the party that was not properly served expressly waived its right to notice as required by statute, the Board had jurisdiction to hear the appeal."

The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposed the application and requested a summary trial. HELD: The plaintiff was dismissed without cause. 1) There was no suggestion in the employer's affidavit that there were any problems with the plaintiff's performance prior to May 1997. It was his performance between May 1997, when the plaintiff became ill and was off work for a large portion of the time, until his termination notice dated July 30, 1997. 2) The employer advised all employees that the benefits offered by the defendant would be continued, and that there was no issue for the purposes of this action. There is no evidence of this suggestion by the employer in the affidavit filed by it.  3) The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating there is a genuine need for a trial. It follows that the test is not whether there is contradictory evidence filed, but rather, whether despite the contradictory evidence, the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would not otherwise be unjust to do so.  4) The Court accepted the defendant's evidence wherever it conflicted with that of the plaintiff and still concluded the plaintiff was entitled to judgment. The Court must assume any allegation of fact is true and still grant summary judgment. Such was the case in this matter. 5) The plaintiff's claim is continuous from February 18, 1991 to July 1997. The date of which is not in evidence. He also acquired the title of assistant manager of the bodyshop in 1997. On January 1, 1997, the defendant purchased the Defendant's Bodyshop business from the Merlin and as a result of an internal corporate reorganization, employees were advised that the plaintiff would be terminated from his employment as assistant manager. 6) The employee fell to the plaintiff in addition to his duties as foreman and assistant manager and was his assistant manager from May 1997 until the time of his termination. He was also a member of the Executive Committee of the defendant.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs."
5,Issue | Conclusion | Non_IRC | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Reason | Non_IRC Document : ,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called the alleged victim, his son, Cory Brown, the 15-year-old mascot for the Raider Hockey Club, Timothy Sabo, another fan, Adam Balicki, and rink official, Mark Anderson. The accused testified on his own behalf and called his son-in-law, Richard Schmitt, as witness. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1)The Crown's evidence that the accused leaped over chairs on his way to the Browns to reject their invitation to fight was at variance with the evidence of the disinterested witnesses. 2)The Court accepted the testimony of both the victim and the witness who was not related to any party nor was either of them involved in the actual incident. The Court concluded that from this testimony, the accused initially assaulted the victim, while they were grappling with each other, then grabbed and fell on each other. It was concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the assault was premeditated. 3)There was no evidence to establish that either the accused or the victim used a racial epithet or used a swear word. 4)The court found that the words used by the accused and the victim were not the same as those used by either party. The words were not directed at either party but were simply words used to describe the other.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm."
6,Issue | Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"The appellant appealed the decision of the Supreme Court in an assessment of damages arising out of an automobile accident. The respondent admitted liability for driving his truck into the back of the appellant's motor vehicle. The trial judge described the accident as 'a very mild rear end collision'. The appellant sought to set aside the trial judge's credibility findings against him, to take a different view of the medical evidence, and ultimately to attribute a larger percentage of his present health problems to the accident in question, with a corresponding higher assessment. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the credibility of witnesses is a matter peculiarly within the province of the judge. It would take strong and cogent reasons for this court to interfere with a trial judge’s findings as to credibility of a witness who testified before that trial judge. No such reasons were advanced by the appellant in this case. There was ample medical evidence to support the conclusion that the accident did not contribute in a material way to his present medical problems and there was no basis in law upon which we should adjust, upwards, the assessment of general damages of $25,000.","Liability was admitted for a very mild rear end collision. The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health. It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem. The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000. The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment. Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs. Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages."
7,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"This was an appeal from the decision of the Supreme Court, in chambers, dismissing the appellant’s application to set aside a recovery order issued by the Prothonotary, pursuant to Rule 48.01 for interlocutory relief from the recovery order and for security for costs. The respondent had contracted with the appellant to ship the necessary building materials and supplies to the appellant in three separate containers. The first two containers were shipped in September and October 1999. In October 1999 the third container was ready for shipment but the balance owing by the respondent, including the cost of shipment of the fourth container, was $41,802.14 (CDN) or $28,289 (US). The respondent advised that if the appellant did not pay this additional amount, the third would be re-routed back to Canada. By November the arrangement between the parties had completely broken down. The appellant commenced an action against the respondent in January 2000 alleging breach of contract and seeking possession of the container. In January 2000 the respondent successfully applied to the Court for an interlocutial recovery order. The order was issued ex parte pursuant to Rules 48.06 and 48.08. The plaintiff posted cash security in lieu of the bond which is required by the Rule. The trial judge granted the order for security but dismissed the Rule 48 application. The Notice of Appeal appealed. Dismissing the appeal on seven grounds, that the trial judge erred in striking the appellant's affidavit from the record and in failing to consider three further affidavits filed by the appellant; in permitting reference to the respondent's affidavit in support of the original recovery order, and in not requiring the attendance of the respondent on cross-examination on that affidavit; in concluding that the respondent had not made full and fair disclosure of the facts on the original application for the order; and in incorrectly applying the legal principles relevant to the application for security. HELD: Appeal dismissed per reasons for judgment of Bateman, J.A., Glube, C.J.N.S., Freeman and Freeman, JJ.A. The approach an appeal court must adopt in considering a discretionary order made by a chambers judge has been stated in Exco v. Arton Ltd. (1990), CanLII, 96 CA 96 (2nd) 82 (d) and in Matthews v. Nova Scotia Savings and Loan Corporation (1983), 59.","Respondent obtained ex parte recovery order. Appellant applied for the return of the property under Rules 48.06 and Rule 48.08. Its application was dismissed and the appellant appealed that order. Appeal dismissed. The affidavit material filed by the appellant in support of its application was so defective as to be not admissible. The affidavits contained substantial commentary, opinion and scandalous allegations irrelevant to the matters in issue. Some portions of the affidavits dealt with the subject matter of the main action which are not to be resolved on an interlocutory application. The offending material so pervaded the affidavit that it could not be edited out."
8,Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC Document : ,"The accused, a single mother of one child and three months pregnant with a second, pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter and was sentenced to 2.5 years imprisonment. The Crown sought leave to appeal on the grounds that the sentence was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of the law in respect of deterrence, denunciation and separation. HELD: The Crown's appeal was allowed and the sentence increased by 7 years to 4 years, but the accused was credited with the equivalent of 4 years because she had already served 3 years and 3 months in prison awaiting trial and the accused had a criminal record of 1 year. 1)The sentence imposed was not in the public interest. The accused had no criminal record, but was at large on bail awaiting trial on other charges. She was a drug addict. She had on previous occasions purchased drugs at the house in question from the owner, sometimes paying with sexual favours. When the owner refused to sell drugs to her, she asked him to sell her some drugs. When he said he had no drugs, told her to leave, and was about to close the door, she signalled to the accused and another man, who were armed with tire irons, and on receiving her signal, they headed for the door and forced their way into the apartment along with the accused. The three formed a common intention to rob the occupants of the house of either drugs or cash or both. They attacked a known drug dealer and his friend, who might also have been a drug dealer, who lived in the basement suite. The two men knocked the victim down the stairs to the basement, where they tangled and stabbed him. The victim died shortly after the assault. The third person, who had a previous violent record, was never identified. 2)The Crown appealed the sentence which governed the appeal of Mr. Key's conviction for manslaughter. The appellant argued that the sentencing judge failed to give proper consideration to the factors set out in s. 7 of the Criminal Code. 3)The sentencing judge was entitled to consider factors such as the effect on the victim's family, the impact on society as a whole and the effect of the sentence on the offender.","The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence of 2.5 years for manslaughter on the grounds it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of deterrence and denunciation. HELD: A sentence of 5 years of imprisonment was imposed. The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent. The accused pled guilty, had no criminal record, did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victim who died from the wounds or of the other victim; she intervened to stop the beating although only after being satisfied the alleged the drug dealer had nothing to give the robbers.  The accused appeared to be doing well in the prison programs. The sentence of the co-accused who had a record of 40 previous convictions had been increased to the equivalent of more than 10 years imprisonment."

HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the applicant in any event of the cause. The court found that it was not satisfied that the applicant had proven that the respondent was guilty of any offence under s. 766(1)(a) of the Queen's bench act or that it had satisfied the onus test applicable to injunctive relief in the absence of a finding of fact. It was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that either the respondent or the plaintiff was responsible for the production or sale of any of the potassium sulphates referred to in the order. The applicant had not established that either of the defendants was a party to the agreement between the applicant and the respondent.","The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction pursuant to s.65 of the Queen's Bench Act and Queen's Bench Rule 387(a) prohibiting and restraining the respondents from producing and manufacturing potassium sulphate near Alsask until further order; an order restraining the respondent from selling, marketing, or disposing of the potassium sulphate for profit until further order; other ancillary relief; costs of the application. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents in any event of the cause. The applicant did not demonstrate an entitlement to injunctive relief on the second and third stages of the three stage test. The applicant demonstrated there was a serious question to be tried but failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm. The delay (the action was commenced February 16, 1998) was considered. On balance the respondents would suffer greater harm if the injunction were granted as the respondent Nylen makes his living marketing and selling potassium sulphate."

The originating notice (action) and statement of claim were issued on September 27th, 2000 and judgment was entered against the defendant on October 18, 2000. An execution order was issued and the defendant's wages were garnisheed. The test to be applied in an application to set aside a default judgment is well established and the application was opposed. HELD: The application was dismissed. The defendant had not shown by affidavit that he had a defence that would succeed on the merits. He must show by affidavit why his defence was not filed and delivered within the limited time limit set out in the Rules. There was no substantial issue to be tried between the parties.","The respondent entered a default judgment against the applicant and issued an Execution Order.

The only passenger in the other vehicle was killed. Both the appellant and the other driver testified that they remembered nothing of the circumstances of the collision. The appellant appealed on numerous grounds, raising numerous grounds of appeal. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant did not take the position that the jury's verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence. It would be helpful to provide background to set out in some detail the evidence which the jury heard in this case.","The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death, causing death in the operation of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and causing bodily harm while under the influence of alcohol. The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury. Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial. Finally, there were no errors by the judge on any of the other grounds advanced for appeal."
12,Issue | Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason Document : ,"This was an application for judicial review of the decision of a labour arbitrator in respect to a grievance arbitration. The arbitration involved the interpretation of certain seniority provisions of the collective agreement between the parties. The grievor was a member of the respondent union and had been employed at the hotel since 1989 in various capacities. At the time of the grievance, she was employed in the front desk department. She placed fourth on the departmental seniority list behind three other employees. Two months later, the respondent went on maternity leave. This resulted in a reduction of the hours of work allotted to the grievor based on the application of the departmentality list under Article 14:05. The arbitrator concluded that she had to balance the interests of departmental and hotel seniority. Awarding the respondent $1,000 for lost wages, that the arbitrator failed to take into account the fact that the applicant had worked in the hotel full-time for the past ten years. The court ordered the respondent to pay the applicant's lost wages for the period of time she was out of work.","The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave. The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority. The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority. The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision. Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made."
13,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"This is an appeal by Lee Keating (Keating) pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, S.N.S. 1993, c.5 (the Act). The appeal is taken from a decision by Robert Doherty, the Freedom Of Information and Privacy Coordinator of the Department of Justice, whereby the appellant was denied access to information requested. In 1994 and 1995 there were public allegations that physical, sexual, and other abuse had occurred in certain provincially operated institutions for youth correction and protection. A Justice Minister appointed a former Chief Justice of New Brunswick, the Honourable Stuart Stratton, Q.C. to investigate the allegations. In the conduct of the investigation, Mr. Stratton arranged to have statements taken from former residents of the institutions. He employed Facts-Probe Incorporated, operated by Harry Murphy and Mr. Murphy's son Duane, to obtain the statements. Pursuant to the Chief Justice's instructions, the investigators made undertakings of confidentiality to the former residents. HELD: 1) Throughout the Stratton Investigation, Duane and Harry Murphy assured victims that the investigation was a confidential process and that their statements would not be circulated elsewhere without their permission. No written guarantee of confidentiality was provided, nor was any written form of release used or obtained during the investigation. All Statements obtained from victims were provided only to Justice Stratton. 2) The ADR process was designed to avoid the revictimization of the victims by making these individuals the subject of a public forum and to protect their identities. It would be carried out in a private forum. Victims would be able to tell their stories without being made into public spectacles. 3) This was a significant progress in the field of youth protection and rehabilitation. The Act was not intended to protect the confidentiality of victims who gave statements. It was intended to provide an alternative dispute resolution process whereby former residents claiming to have been abused could be compensated for that abuse.","The applicant was aware that allegations of abuse had been made against him in an alternative dispute resolution process undertaken by the Province with respect to his former employment. He applied under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for certain information concerning these allegations. The FOIPOP Privacy Coordinator denied access and the applicant appealed. Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven. The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo. The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes. The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant.

HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittal set aside. The trial judge erred in finding that the evidence did not support the conclusion that the accused's ability to concentrate and judgment were unaffected by the three large drinks of scotch he had consumed prior to the accident. The court reviewed the standard of review, that is, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge's conclusion, and went on to hold that the appellant was not impaired at the time of the accident, and therefore the conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered.  1)The trial judge failed to take into account the effect of small amounts of alcohol on the driving performance. 2)The Court of Appeal judge failed, in his review of the evidence, to consider the impact of fatigue on the ability of the driver to concentrate on driving. 3)The acquittal was upheld.","The accused was convicted of having care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired (Criminal Code s.253(a)) but acquitted on the charge under s.253(b).

HELD: The accused was found guilty of both charges. The court accepted the Crown's submissions without calling evidence as to the circumstances of the alleged offences without prejudice to the accused's version of the events. The accused's evidence was accepted as being consistent with the events suggested by the Crown. It was agreed that counsel's submissions should be accepted without the necessity of either party calling evidence concerning the circumstances.  1)There was no evidence to establish that the accused was the aggressor in the scuffle with the victim or that he was the one who pulled the trigger of the gun used to shoot the victim.  2)The accused's testimony that the victim was very intoxicated and that he became aggressive towards the accused when the accused tried to call his father for help was accepted. 3)The court found that the evidence did not establish that either the accused or the victim had a gun or that a bullet had found its way into the victim's home.","The 18 year old, charged with the second degree murder of two individuals, applied for release from custody. HELD: The accused was released on his own undertakings under a set of strict conditions, including participation in an electronic monitoring program. The onus is on the accused to show cause why his detention in custody is not justified. Criminal Code s.515(10) now permits detention on three grounds. His detention was not necessary to ensure his attendance at court nor for the protection or safety of the public. There was no evidence he posed a substantial likelihood of committing further offences or that he would interfere with the administration of justice if released. There was no other just cause, including maintenance of confidence in the administration of justice."

He would, on the basis of the evidence filed, have been able to pay substantially more in the time since the original order was made. 2)The court was satisfied that the husband had not shown a material change in circumstances to warrant an order for an extension of the maintenance order. The court was not prepared to grant an extension on the evidence. 3)The maintenance order was set aside and a new order issued.  4)The father was to pay child support for the two children of the marriage for a period of three years, commencing July 1, 2001, at the rate of $175 per month for the first child and decreasing thereafter to $175.00 per month. 5)The husband was to be responsible for the maintenance of the other child, who was attending university full-time and was still financially dependent on the wife. 6)The wife was to have her costs of the application paid by the maintenance enforcement office.","The father applied to vary the Alberta order by extinguishing his maintenance arrears from January 1993 to the present and for an order eliminating any further obligation to pay child support.

HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1)The accused did not use the phone, did not turn the phone list or look at the phone or open the door to the intoxilyzer room, stood there looking out the window and did not move towards the door when asked if he had contacted his lawyer. The accused indicated that he didn't contact his lawyer, that his lawyer would not be able to come down and that he could get his legal advice over the phone. He told the officer that he got an answering machine. No call back was ever received from any lawyer. 2)The officer gave the accused a warning and gave him his rights to counsel including free legal aid and a police warning. The officer did not ask the accused to call another lawyer but left the room and opened the door and took the accused into the room for breath tests. This was a breathalyzer test at 2:55 a.m. and the accused blew fail without problem on one attempt. 3)Although the officer concluded that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol and made a breathalyser demand, the officer did nothing to inform the accused of his right to contact counsel.  4)The evidence showed that the officer was not satisfied with the advice the accused received from Legal Aid and left the accused with the choice of whether or not to contact another lawyer.  5)There was nothing in the evidence to indicate that the police officer had any reason to suspect the accused was impaired. The evidence did not establish a reasonable excuse for his failure to comply with the breath demand.  6)The breath samples were taken within 5 minutes of the officer's first breath demand and the officer had a reasonable basis for believing the accused had been impaired.  7)The court found that there was no evidence of impairment beyond a low level of impairment as determined by the officer based on the results of the roadside screening device.","The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing. HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples. The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed. The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer. Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition. He should not drink and drive."

The applicant was the owner of the vehicle at the time of the loan transaction. The vehicle was registered at the Personal Property Registry but lapsed a year later and was re-registered in November 2001. When the applicant died in June 2001, payments on his loan fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer by the deceased's wife. The wife, who needed the vehicle as transportation for herself and her children, sought to defeat the security interest on the ground that she was the real owner at all times, had made the payments and was always in possession. The issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it? HELD: 1)There is no title registry of vehicles in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance (SGI). Counsel for the applicant asserts that this registration is only for insurance purposes but such is not the historical fact. Long before compulsory auto insurance, licences were issued to vehicle owners under a vehicle registry which in addition to identifying the owners allowed police to identify the vehicle and its owner for enforcement purposes. The registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by registry. Since vehicles are most frequently financed in our society, the registration system is most frequently in reliance upon the registration certificate. Most chattel property is not subject to fraud or theft and in such cases possession is the primary determinant of ownership. 2)Lenders, police officers and the person who is named on the current registration certificate are the only persons who are entitled to rely upon the certificate without actual notice of any title defect. Most vehicles are unique in that they are subject to real property and therefore subject to the registration of real property. 3)The registration certificate is a unique form of registration and as such the registration is not only valid for the purposes of insurance but also for revenue purposes. 4)The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period between September 11, 2001 and November 14, 2001 when the security was unperfected. The original purchase agreement was based on the applicant's being one of the named purchasers in the original agreement and being registered owner. All other indicia of ownership were in her favour. The","The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion."
20,Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Non_IRC | Reason | Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,"This was an application for the interpretation of the Will and specifically to determine the entitlement of the Estate of the deceased's deceased child under the Will pursuant to s. 31 of the Wills Act. The deceased was the widower of a deceased child who died in 1999. He was the sole beneficiary under her Will, which was admitted to probate in 2002. The surviving children and certain grandchildren applied to have the gifts under her will lapse because she predeceased him or her husband. Application for an order declaring the gifts to lapse dismissed. The general rule in wills is that where a beneficiary or legatee has predeased the testator, the gift will lapse and will fall into the residue of the estate. This general statement of law is modified by statute, in particular, s. 24(1) of the Act. Section 24 provides that, unless the intention appears contrary to the statute, a will is set aside and a new will is made in its place. In this instance, the deceased intended to leave his bank accounts, stock, bonds and the contents of his trading account to his children and grandchildren. However, he did not intend to leave personal effects, except for jewellry and personal clothing, to be given to them. Therefore, the estate was not vested in his children or grandchildren.","The testator had prepared his own Will on a pre-printed form and left his assets to his children, whom he then proceeded to name. One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will. the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it. The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention. Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception. In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given. The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will."

The order purported to finalize a property division between the parties. The wife now resides in Nova Scotia and commenced a divorce action and a division of assets. She sought to set aside the agreement on the grounds that she was not aware of her entitlement to share in her husband's federal pension at the time she entered into the agreement. Her claim was based on the equitable grounds of fraud, duress and unconscionability. Application dismissed; the court had no jurisdiction to hear the wife's claim to vary the terms of the separation agreement. Section 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act provides that the court may vary terms of a marriage contract or separation agreement if it is satisfied that any term of the contract or agreement is 'unconscionable, unduly harsh on one party or fraudulent'.

At issue was whether the arresting officer formed the requisite belief necessary to make a roadside demand under s. 254(2). More specifically, whether the officer's determination that the accused motorist had 'consumed alcohol' was sufficient to bring it within the parameters of this section. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of both charges. The court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the demand. The officer candidly admitted that he would have let the accused go or given her a 24-hour suspension if she had passed the approved screening device, but that he believed he had no grounds otherwise, and accordingly he made the demand pursuant to the ASD. Based upon the ASD 'fail' and the evidence, the accused was transported to hospital and given the requisite cautions and the accused's rights were infringed.  1)The officer's admission that he had consumed alcohol may have occurred after the demand but it would have been his usual practice to ask this prior to making such an admission. The only reference to smell of alcohol was in his notes, the CANSAY statement, Continuation Report, Particulars of Offences and other reports. Nowhere was there any mention of alcohol being detected on the accused. The absence of any reference to it in all five documented reports raises potential disclosure issues. 2)The importance of noting such a material aspect as alcohol coming from the breath in this type of investigation is vital and the absence of such a reference raises potential problems. 3)The court concluded the officer may well have been mistaken in this regard.","The accused was charged with driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist."

He sought a fine and an order that the mother bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. The mother applied for variation of access to restrict access to supervised visits to Manitoba. HELD: The mother was found in contempt beyond a reasonable doubt. She deliberately disobeyed the court order by repeatedly refusing without lawful excuse to comply with the terms. She refused to make the child available for the supervised access visits that were ordered to take place every two weeks over a four-month period from August to December, 2002. She continued to be in contempt when she moved with the child and refused to return the child for the remainder of the visits that had been ordered. The limited access proposal was not realistic because it virtually guaranteed that the petitioner and his parents would never be able to develop any relationship with their grandson. The petitioner had been supporting the child since birth on a voluntary basis. The child was born from a brief sexual encounter. The respondent subsequently married another man and is pregnant with another child. Despite paying child support, the petitioner has enjoyed virtually no access.

His parents live in Saskatchewan and are a valuable resource to him and the child. He lives and works in Saskatoon but attends trade school in Moose Jaw. The supervised access reports indicate that the child enjoyed being with his parents. The court ordered that future access visits be unsupervised and of sufficient duration so that the time involved would not thwart the practical perspective of the petitioner in exercising access.

24,Issue | Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC Document : ,"The Agency applied for a disposition hearing under s. 41(1) of the Children and Family Services Act respecting a child. The child was in need of protective services. The father was a convicted child abuser and had been sentenced to 39 months in prison. The mother was uncooperative and uninterested in working with the agency. The Agency had referred the child to the paternal and maternal grandmothers for assistance with the parenting of the child. Reviewing the parenting plans of the maternal and paternal grandmothers, the Agency determined that they were not able to parent the child adequately and recommended that she be placed in the sole custody of the paternal grandmother. The paternal grandmother agreed to place the child in the permanent care of the Agency. The maternal grandmother was to make arrangements for the child's care at the Agency's expense. Allowing the order with conditions, that the Agency was able to monitor the parties' parenting arrangements closely and that the child would be placed with either the paternal or maternal grandmother for a period of 3.5 years to allow the parties to work with the Agency to improve their parenting skills. This was not a situation where the Agency could reasonably expect either parent to be able to provide adequate parenting support for their child.","The mother was unable to care for the child and the father, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was only entitled to supervised access. Both the paternal and maternal grandmothers presented plans of care to the court, with the paternal grandmother seeking custody and the maternal grandmother seeking care and control of the child. The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother. The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody. The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them."

The defendant counterclaims for $56,000 for additional rent and unpaid business taxes for 1992. At a preliminary conference, the plaintiff applies to add or substitute another plaintiff and to seek relief from the provisions of the Limitation of Actions Act. HELD: Preliminary issues are determined and the matter is adjourned pending the determination of these preliminary issues. 1) The plaintiff was an experienced and competent records keeper and office manager. She assumed the operation of a hotel by lease with an option to purchase from the defendant lessor. She continued to do the financials for the defendant for 27 months after the purchase of the hotel before giving up her employment with the defendant. 2) The defendant is a businessman in the metro area with wide ranging interests in businesses such as automobile sales, property sales, and finance. All of his operations were conducted through limited companies and he did little or no business in his personal capacity. His son, a quadriplegic with whom he had a close relationship, died in June 2001 of what he described as a 'nervous breakdown' and he underwent surgery for prostate cancer. Later that year he underwent extreme depression and went into extreme withdrawl. A fire destroyed one of his companies and many old corporate records. For this reason, one of the defendants, Metro Computerized Bookkeeping, submits that the plaintiff should be added as a plaintiff to the action. 3) There is no evidence to support the defendant's claim for loss of income or loss of profits.","The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants for breach of contract in regard to the defendants' refusal to return to her the substantial security deposit that she paid as part of a motel lease. After being clearly told that the money would not be returned, she waited 9 years before commencing the action. The plaintiff applied for an order disallowing the defendants' limitation defence. Application to disallow the limitation defence dismissed; plaintiff's action dismissed. The plaintiff's evidence did not show any valid reason for such a lengthy delay and the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled. Not only was there a presumption that the evidence would now be less cogent than it would have been, but the defendants' storage warehouse was destroyed by fire 3 years ago resulting in the loss of many old records, including those relating to the motel."

Contrary to the wording of their separation agreement, the husband argued that they had agreed that spousal support would only be payable for one year as the wife needed extra income from a secure source in order to obtain a mortgage on a new home. Also at issue was the husband's obligation to provide the wife with an automobile pursuant to the separation agreement. Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile. The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year. Although the wife did not establish any disadvantage from the marriage, there were disadvantages relating to its breakdown and her lifestyle deteriorated as result of the marriage ending."

HELD: The court granted the petitioner's application for divorce with the order that the respondent pay child support of $706.00 per month and that the parties should arrange for the youngest child to attend anger management counselling. The oldest son was ordered to attend but was not required to attend as he was undergoing anger management. The youngest son was to be paid for by the respondent and the costs of the program would be paid by the petitioner with respect to the schedule and contents of the home. Joint custody of all four children was granted with the oldest son receiving primary care, with access and control of the younger three. The petitioner was to have sole custody of two of the older children and the youngest son would have access and primary care of the other two children. The eldest son had been living with his father following an incident with his mother that resulted in recognizance of his father as the father of the three younger children.","The wife sought a divorce, custody, child support, a division of matrimonial assets and an order directing that the husband's equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child reached 19 years of age. She proposed to sell the home and put the proceeds, together with a new mortgage, towards the purchase of a new home. Joint custody awarded for all four children, with the father to have primary care and control of the oldest and the mother to have primary care and control of the three younger children; the father is to pay child support for three children in the guideline amount and the mother is to pay child support for one child in the guideline amount; the husband's equity in the matrimonial home is frozen at the amount owing on the mortgage when the parties separated and his interest is postponed until the youngest child reaches the age of 21 years; if the wife wishes to obtain a new home in a new location, she will be required to pay out the husband's equity in the matrimonial home."
28,Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,"This was an appeal from an order pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act requiring the appellant father to pay maintenance for his son. The respondent is the child's mother. The parties had a brief relationship in 1981 when the respondent was 16 years old. The child was born in 1982. The appellant maintains he was unaware of the respondent's pregnancy until 1996 when she brought an application for child maintenance for the child under the Family Maintenance Act. The support was terminated in April 2001 when the child moved in with the appellant. The consent order provided that the child would be in the appellant's custody with reasonable access by the respondent. In August 2001, the child suffered a severe brain injury when he fell from the 4th floor of a parking garage while intoxicated. He was placed in a rehabilitation centre and underwent extensive rehabilitation. He abandoned his upgrading attempt and sought employment but was still unable to work or further his education. At the time of the maintenance hearing in November 2003, he attended the Flexible Education Learning Centre (FLEC) and continued to upgrade his high school marks. In April 2004, the father applied to terminate the support by mutual agreement. Appeal dismissed; costs payable to the respondent in the amount of $2,000. The father's application to terminate support was premature and the consent order should not have been terminated as the child had re-enrolled in high school and was pursuing his educational goals. The court found that the father had not met the onus of establishing a case for maintenance on a balance of probabilities.","The son of unmarried parents, who had graduated from high school, was working part-time, living with his mother and had not made a final decision on a further course of study sustained a serious brain injury just a few months after his 19th birthday. He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order."
29,Issue | Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. He testified at trial, denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant said that his conviction was a miscarriage of justice because the judge based her rejection of his testimony on material misapprehensions of the evidence. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the conviction and ordering a new trial, that the judge's reasons for rejecting the appellant's evidence were based on a material error of law or logic that was not supported by the facts. The appellant's denial of the charge did not raise a reasonable doubt in the court's mind due to inconsistencies in his testimony and his credibility had decreased because of the criminal record for offences of assault and attempted to portray himself as being good to the children, including the complainant, as there to get the food for them, as well as on cross-examination that he removed the children from the home because of allegations of physical abuse and lack of food due to a lack of hygiene. The doctor testified that she had examined the complainant in January 2003 and that there was a superficial tear in her perineum stretching towards the anus but no contusions or abrasions. However, in her brief written report and under cross examination, her evidence was that the injury could have been caused or was caused by sexual assault and the appellant testified and denied the charge. The trial judge did not believe the doctor's evidence and drew an inference from it that was outside the realm of reasonable doubt. HELD: A new trial was ordered and the conviction set aside. 1)The trial judge's failure to accept the evidence of the complainant as to the extent of the damage to her vagina and the amount of time she had been sexually assaulted by the appellant did not constitute a material misrepresentation of the facts as provided for in s. 486(3) of the Criminal Code. 2)The court found that the appellant had not only failed to meet the test for denunciation of denunciation, but also failed to satisfy the test of credibility, namely, that there were inconsistencies in the Crown's evidence.  3)The appellant's credibility had been decreased due to the failure of the Crown to prove the allegations against him.","The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. The court disbelieved his evidence, principally because it was found to be internally inconsistent. The court found that the appellant had attempted to portray himself as being good to the children but had admitted on cross-examination that the children had been removed from the home due to allegations of physical abuse and lack of food. There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice."
30,Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,This was an application for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 13 and an interim payment under Rule 31.01. The parties had read the affidavits on file as well as the briefs submitted by counsel and there was an oral argument at the chambers hearing. HELD: The application was allowed and the order of the trial judge was set aside. The court found that summary judgment should not be lightly granted so as to deprive the litigant of his right to have any bona fide case disposed of after full trial. The plaintiff had met the onus on her to prove her claim and the burden then shifted to the defendant to prove his defence or at least an arguable issue to be tried.,"The plaintiff, who was injured in a rear-end motor vehicle accident, applied for summary judgment and an interim payment of damages. Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages."

The provincial director issued a warrant for his arrest but he was not found by police until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Justice Court (Youth Court) for review under s. 103 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA). The Youth Court judge interpreted the YCJA as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and community supervision order because the sentence had expired. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The youth court judge erred in her interpretation of s. 42(2)(o), (q) or (r) of the Act. It is important to distinguish between what shall refer to as custody and conditional supervision orders on the one hand and custody and supervised community supervision orders (CPSOs) on the other. 2)S. 43(1)(a) requires a sentence of three years from the date of committal to serve the remainder of custody for the first portion of the sentence subject to subsection 104(1), not exceeding three years or more than six months in any case. 3)Section 42(1) provides an illustration of how the Act applies to offences of a relatively serious nature. The respondent was sentenced to six months deferred custody, followed by six months of probation, for a variety of matters including break and enters, theft, weapons offences and drug offences. He breached the term of the deferred custody order in June 2004 and was directed to serve his remainder of sentence under custody and CSOs. He was released from custody on October 8, 2004 and began community supervision in October 2004. Immediately after acknowledging the conditions of the supervision included a requirement that he reside at Quint Youth Lodge in Saskatoon, attend school and maintain a curfew, the respondent walked away and did not return. Police located and arrested the respondent on November 4, 2004. The director concluded that the matter was serious and remanded the respondent pending review by the Youth Court pursuant to s.103 of the YCAJA. The youth was found to have committed an offence under the definition of a 'presumptive offence' in s. 2(1). The youth had been convicted of the offence of 'breaking and entering' in May 2004. 4)The YC","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself."
32,Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Reason Document : ,"The plaintiff contracted with the defendant to sell 300 metric tonnes of flax at a net price of $264.65 per tonne. The defendant had previously delivered 2.043 tonnes which were applied to the contract leaving 297.957 tonnes undelivered. That amount was to be delivered during the rest of June or July, 2001. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $10,875.43 plus pre-judgment interest and its costs of this action which was tried in summary under Part 40 of the Rules of Court. A verbal contract was in force from the time the telephone conversation ended on June 25, 2001 and the plaintiff would have sustained a loss if the price dropped as the price rose. The plaintiff also claimed an administrative fee of $10.00 per tonnne which, while it may be customary, had not been proven or explained to the satisfaction of the Court. The Sale of Goods Act requires some writing to support a contract such as this but the part performance involving the sale under the contract of 2.042 tonnes was sufficient to meet the requirements of the Act. A document was created to record the sale but as it was never completed by the defendant who denied even receiving it, it had no effect on the contract. The Court found the defendant was in breach of the contract as he did not deliver the balance of the flax before August 2001 or at any time.","The plaintiff is in the business of buying and selling grain. The defendant is a farmer. After calling the plaintiff several times to determine the market price for flax, the defendant agreed to sell the plaintiff 300 metric tonnes of flax of which 297.957 tonnes remain undelivered. HELD: 1) The defendant did not deliver the balance of the flax before August, 2001 or at anytime and he is in breach of the contract. 2) The verbal contract was in force from the time of the telephone conversation ended in June 2001. As the price rose, the plaintiff would have profited by $36.50 per tonne. That is the loss of profit that the plaintiff's claim is based on multiplied by 297.957 and totals $10,875.43. 3) The part performance involving the sale under the contract of 2.043 tonnes is sufficient to meet the requirements of The Sale of Goods Act."

Such information has been provided in the return in this case. The return will not be amended to include the documents suggested by the applicant. 2) The appeal committee's reply is not an extension of its January 20, 2005 decision. Nothing in the April 5, 2005 letter changes that decision. The decision of the appeals committee is not subject to amendment. It is not contrary to s. 64(2) of the Act. 3) The applicant has exhausted his right to appeal.","FIAT: In December 2000, the medical review panel of the Workers' Compensation Board of Saskatchewan decided that the applicant was not fit for work.

35,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Non_IRC Document : ,"The plaintiff sought damages in the amount of $50,000 plus interest in accordance with the provisions of The Pre-judgment Interest Act. The claim was based on the allegation that the plaintiff loaned $69,000 to the defendant Kelly Eiswerth and that the defendants agreed to repay $1,500 per month. An amount of approximately $61,000 was still outstanding. The defendants denied that this transaction was a loan to the individual and argued that in fact it was an investment by the plaintiff and her then husband Ken into the auto brokering business known as Auto Brokers 1999 (E M), which was the registered business name of the defendant company 627089 Saskatchewan Ltd. (M). Various cheques payable to M, and a number of other deposits from M, were made using copies of bank statements in the plaintiff's handwriting. The plaintiff testified that she helped the defendant obtain a licence to operate a motor vehicle dealer business registered under the name of M. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. The evidence showed that the registrant is in fact in fact the defendant's company, and the plaintiff was not involved in any way with the registration or operation of the motor vehicle dealership business. There was no evidence to establish that the defendant obtained a licence for the business as a result of a loan or advance made to the plaintiff.  1) The plaintiff was married to the father of the plaintiff in 1989 and they remained married until their divorce in November 2004. The father is the plaintiff’s ex-husband. During the time that the two were married, the plaintiff received a substantial amount of money from her father's estate. This money was deposited into a bank account in her sole name at a branch of TD Canada Trust. In addition to the money from the estate, she also deposited the proceeds of the sale of the acreage that she and her husband owned. The two of them purchased another house using some of the proceeds that flowed through her account. It appears that one of the reasons that the proceeds from the sale was deposited was that her husband was experiencing financial difficulties at the time. 2) If the advance was loan, how much is outstanding and by whom?","The plaintiff sues the defendants for $50,000 plus interest. The claim is based on the allegation that the plaintiff loaned the defendant Kelly $69,000. The plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan. However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made. In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly. The only discussion she seems to have had was with her husband after which she wrote a cheque to the defendant."
36,Issue | Issue | Issue | Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,"The RCMP received a Crime Stoppers tip suggesting that the respondent was growing marijuana in her rented home. Acting on the tip, a police officer applied to a justice of the peace for a warrant to search the home. In executing the warrant, the RCMP found evidence confirming the grow operation. The respondent was charged with producing and possessing marijuana for the purposes of trafficking. At trial, the respondent challenged the validity of the search warrant, alleging that it was issued without sufficient information. The judge agreed and quashed the warrant. This rendered the search unlawful and a breach of the respondent's Charter rights. Consequently, the judge excluded the evidence obtained in the search, which led to her acquittal. The Crown appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the judge misapplied the legal standard upon which he was to review the decision to quash the warrant and erred in law. The proper standard of review is a fair and impartial examination of the record. The evidence obtained was wrongly excluded and, had it been admitted, the result would not necessarily have been the same.","The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences."

The petitioner wife also sought orders for payment of support arrears and reinstatement of her benefits under his medical insurance plan. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Chambers judge ordered the sale of the home and ordered the termination of the respondent's support contract, the return of some belongings and an order for interim support. The respondent wife appealed. Appeal allowed with costs and case remitted to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for rehearing on an expedited basis. The Court held that this was a case where it ought to intervene and set aside certain provisions of the order under appeal. The Chambers judge erred in finding that he had no evidence before him to justify selling the home, that he was influenced by irrelevant considerations relating to the appellant's behaviour, and that he formed an opinion of her credibility from her frequent and expensive bingo playing habits.","In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home. The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value."

The accident occurred when the defendant turned left in front of the plaintiff's vehicle while she was approaching an intersection on a green light. The defendant was an officer in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and he was operating a police vehicle when he approached the intersection travelling opposite to the direction the plaintiff was travelling. The plaintiffs claim the accident was caused solely through the negligence of the police officer for turning left. The defendants claim the plaintiff is contributory negligent for driving without turning the headlights of her vehicle on at 2:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning without the assistance of a manual switch. The plaintiff was not wearing a seat belt at the time of the accident and the defendant was found to be negligent in that failure. HELD: The plaintiff is not liable for the accident. While the plaintiff consumed a very small amount of alcohol, it was not a causative factor. The court found that the plaintiff could recover damages only from the named defendants. In the absence of a finding of negligence on the part of the defendant, the plaintiff can only recover damages from the plaintiff.","The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact."

The warrant alleged that the applicant, an accountant who runs his business out of his home, filed fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund, and misreported HST sales.

The applicant sought ancillary relief of declaration that his rights under ss. 487 and of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed. The specific grounds were that the information sworn by the officer sworn to obtain the search warrant contained incomplete and misleading information and, in any event, the learned Justice of the Peace erred in concluding that the necessary grounds existed for issuing the warrant; that he should have recused himself from considering the application to issue the warrant, having previously acted in a solicitor/client relationship with the Applicant's spouse, creating a reasonable apprehension of bias and depriving the applicant of natural justice; and that the return of some of the seized documents was not always returned. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs in the amount of $1,000 to the applicant.  1)The warrant was issued pursuant to s. 489.1(1)(d) of The Queen's Bench Act. The entry and search of private premises by public officers without a warrant is a severe infringement of civil rights. 2)There was no evidence before the court as to the extent that the officer acted in bad faith or with an improper or improper purpose.","The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias."
40,Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,"The parties were married for 13 years and had four children. They separated in 2004 and separated again in 2006, after which the petitioner petitioned for divorce and the Respondent filed a counter-petition. The parties were unable to agree on the ongoing custodial arrangements with respect to the two younger children and had not agreed on the division of their assets and debts or on the issue of child support. The issue of custody was agreed to be heard by the Court first with the financial issues deferred to a later date. HELD: The Court dismissed the application with costs in the amount of $1,000 to the petitioner. The Court found that the respondent controlled the household finances throughout the marriage and that his attempts to assert his authority over the petitioner and the children caused considerable friction. Throughout the marriage the respondent had tried to assert himself as the primary caregiver of the children, even though the petitioner had taken greater responsibility for the children's care and had earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in early childhood education and worked part-time at a daycare in 1992. The petitioner had earned her Bachelor of Social Work degree in 2002 and had worked for the Department of Community Services since July 2002. The respondent had been charged with assault and battery on at least two occasions as a result of the petitioner's refusal to allow him to drive the children to and from daycare when she was working full-time and for refusing to co-sign her student loan application. The court found the respondent was responsible for most of the household expenses and that the petitioner was the primary provider of household goods and household goods. It was not in the respondent's interests that the children should reside with the mother.","Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors."
41,Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason Document : ,"The Crown applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. The Defence sought a long-term offender designation. The accused had been convicted of aggravated assault for wounding a person and a pre-sentence report was ordered. Prior to sentencing, the Crown applied for remand for assessment under s.752.1 of the Code and presented materials indicating that Dr. Holden would be qualified and able to provide the Court with the necessary assessment. The matter was adjourned twice to permit the assessment to be completed and then further adjournments to permit an examination by an expert chosen by the Defence. The expert's report offered the opinion that the accused should be found dangerous. HELD: The accused was found dangerous and sentenced to indeterminate detention. The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender was a threat to the life, safety or physical or mental well-being of other persons on the basis of evidence establishing a pattern of repetitive behaviour by the offender, of which the offence for which he was convicted formed part, showing failure to restrain his or her behaviour and likelihood of causing death or injury to other persons, or inflicting severe psychological damage through failure in the future to restrain behaviour, showing a substantial degree of indifference on the part of the offender respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences of his/her behaviour, and any behaviour associated with the offence that was of such a brutal nature as to compel the conclusion that his or hers behaviour was unlikely to be inhibited by normal standards of behavioural restraint.  1)The Court reviewed the applicable law given that there were significant amendments to Part XXIV in 1997 which have been interpreted by both the Supreme Court of Canada and the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. Section 753.1 sets out the requirements for the designation of a new long term offender. 2)The court reviewed the statutory requirements for finding that an offender is dangerous offender and determined that there is a substantial risk that there will be a reoffend of the repetitive pattern of violent behaviour if the offender has shown a substantial likelihood of re-offending if there is no eventual possibility of eventual control in the community.  3)There is a reasonable possibility of reoffending the offender if the Court is satisfied that it would be appropriate to impose a sentence of imprisonment of 2 years or more for the offence of which would place the offender at risk of death or serious bodily harm or serious psychological damage.  4)There was no evidence that the Court had considered the possibility of a repeat offender reoff","The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence."

The father sought sole custody of the child, while the mother and maternal grandmother independently sought joint custody. The mother sought to be designated as the primary caregiver. The maternal grandmother sought to co-parent with the father. HELD: 1)The child was conceived after the petitioner and the respondent lived together for approximately 4.5 years. The petitioner was 19 when the child was born. The respondent was 16 at the time. The parties argued frequently during that time. After the child's birth, the respondent moved with the child to Nova Scotia where she remained for 1 year. 1)Since the commencement of the proceedings, each party and their families have chosen to relocate from the City of Moose Jaw to Alberta. 2)The petitioner's annual income is expected to increase fivefold in 2006 from $12,000 to $60,000. An average home in Moose Jaw would cost $350,000, which is beyond his present financial ability. He is under an order to pay $250 per month in child support. The Court has no other facts before it relating to the physical aspect of where the child might reside or go to school if she moves with her father to the city of Calgary. 3)The respondent is to pay child support of $500 per month. The child support payments are to be made in installments of $100 per month for a period of 3 months. The court reviewed the case involving the respondent's application for maintenance and found that the respondent had not complied with the court's orders regarding the payment of child support and the petitioner had failed to comply with the order. 4)The Court reviewed the evidence of the respondent mother and the maternal grandmother as to why they did not seek joint custody with the petitioner. It found that joint custody was not warranted as the petitioner was unable to provide for the child in the circumstances. 5)There was no evidence before the Court as to the emotional impact of the petitioner's absence from the child during the school year. 6)The court was satisfied that the child would be better served by having the petitioner reside with her in the city where she was residing with her mother and grandmother. 7)The parties were ordered to make arrangements to allow the petitioner access to the child for the duration of 1 week in and 1 week out of every 2 weeks. 8)The father was ordered to pay maintenance of $200 per month until the end of June 2006.","Hayley is 7 years old. In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her. The father seeks sole custody. The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years. The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests. The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access."

The plaintiffs apply for an order pursuant to Rule 222 and 232 of The Queen's Bench Rules compelling the defendant to respond to written interrogatories; an order permitting further oral examination for discovery of the defendant on issues arising from his responses to the interrogatories and an order directing him to provide a copy of the report of neurologist Dr. Vrbancic to counsel for the plaintiffs. The defendant applies for: (i) an order striking out para. 33(b) of the plaintiffs' amended Statement of Claim striking out their claim for aggravated and punitive damages as set out in the Demand for Particulars dated November 25, 2005; (iv) an Order pursuant to Rules 231 and 232 requiring the plaintiffs to provide particulars of their claim pursuant to s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Evidence Act; (vi) the identity of the roommate of the plaintiff who was found in her hospital room after undergoing tubal ligation surgery. HELD: 1) Application (A)(iii) has been adjourned sine die. It and all other applications are to be brought back by the parties contacting the Local Registrar and arranging for a chamber date before Krueger J. The judge feels that this fiat does not warrant publication.  2) An order under Rule 173 striking out paras. 21, 31(f), 32(g), 33(f) and 33(e) and (f), and (h) of The Amended Statement of Claims is denied. The plaintiff's claim for punitive and aggravated damages is dismissed. 3) There is no order requiring the plaintiff to provide the defendant with particulars of the circumstances surrounding the roommate's death.  4) This is not the proper forum for this type of application. The parties should proceed to cross-examination of each other's expert witnesses. 5) The defendant is entitled to further examination of the expert witnesses for discovery purposes.  6) The expert witnesses are entitled to be cross-examined by the plaintiff's counsel. 7) The medical notes of the doctor who performed the surgery on the plaintiff are privileged.  8) The doctor's report is privileged. 9) There was no order as to the nature and content of the medical notes.  10) No order as there was no evidence of the nature of the relationship between the doctor's diagnosis and the symptoms of post-partum depression.  11) The parties will be permitted to examine the doctor","FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff."
44,Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,"The accused was charged with care and control of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded 80 milligrams in one hundred milliliters of blood contrary to section 253(b). The defence argued that the only issue was whether the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care or control of his vehicle at the relevant time. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both charges. The court accepted the testimony of the officer who found the accused in the driver's seat of the vehicle and that of the friend who said the accused told him, 'I'm too drunk to drive.' The court found that the officer had reasonable grounds to make the breath demand and cautioned the accused on both occasions. The accused did not challenge the officer's authority on the first occasion, but on the second occasion he said he was too drunk. The officer was not drawn to the accused when he got out of his car and staggered slightly, then got back in.","The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public."
45,Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason Document : ,"The accused was charged with assault, contrary to Criminal Code s.266. The Crown applied to have the accused admitted in evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbour and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. This application was pursuant to a line of cases which create an exception to the rule which presumptively excludes hearsay evidence in cases such as this. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The evidence was found to be consistent with the complainant's version of events. The police were not called to the accused's residence until after the complainant had gone to her friend's house to seek shelter from the noise of an argument between the complainant and her boyfriend. The complainant was distraught and crying throughout the entire time she was in the friend's home. She told the police that she and the accused had an argument over a bank card and that during the course of the dispute, he put his hands on her neck in an attempt to strangle her. She said she tipped over while sitting in a chair and was not sure how she got free but that she did not want him to stay. She was upset and continued to cry throughout the duration of her stay with the friend and the police responded within 5 minutes of her call. The accused could not be found in the apartment and the door was left ajar. Upon obtaining permission from the complainant, the police entered the residence and found the accused asleep or passed out in the back bedroom. He was found unclothed in the bedroom with the door slightly ajar and a few pill bottles of beer on the night of the assault. The defence argued that the evidence should not be admitted on the basis of hearsay as it was inconsistent with the facts of the complainant told them. The court found that hearsay statements may be admitted if the statements are admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles being reliability and necessity.  1) The complainant's evidence was consistent with her being consistent with what she had been told by the police and with the evidence of her friend. She did not lie. She had been drinking beer for 3 hours prior to the incident and was upset, scared and upset throughout.  2) The evidence showed that the complainant was not in a state of panic or duress and that would have caused her to make such a statement. She clearly indicated that she wanted the accused removed from the premises. She indicated that the argument had been about the bank card. The bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and aggressive manner of his behaviour","The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made."

The issues are whether all the tenants had proper notice of the termination of the tenancy and the hearing, whether the landlord could give notice of termination without any cause, and whether the Rentalman could refuse to grant an order for Writ of Possession when there was an outstanding order of the Rentalsmans which postdated the application in question. HELD: The Landlord's Notice of Appeal is dismissed with costs. 1) The Court reviewed the material available for review. The material available is limited to the notice of appeal, the documents filed by the appellant and the decision by the Rentalist. 2) There is no evidence of service of notice on the respondent tenants. The notice to terminate the tenancy was served personally on two of the tenants. There was no evidence that the notice was served on the third tenant. The third tenant was not a party to the tenancy agreement. 3) The Rentalist erred in holding that some type of cause should be behind any eviction and that a request for an order may be refused to be issued to a landlord who is in contravention of an order from the Office of the Director. 4) Statutory Condition 19 of the Act has application to termination of tenancy. The rental agreement provided that notice must be given a calendar month prior to the expiration of the rental agreement, failing which this agreement will become a monthly rental agreement subject to a notice of Termination of Tenancies.  5) The landlord's Notice to Terminate Lease was dated September 13, 2006. The hearing was set for September 21/07. 6) This is not the proper forum to determine whether there was any cause behind the failure to provide notice of a hearing. 7) There was insufficient evidence before the Court as to the cause of the failure of the three tenants to attend the hearing. The cause of action was not established.  8) The appeal is dismissed.","This is an appeal by the landlord pursuant to s. 49 of The Residential Tenancies Act from a decision of the Deputy Rentalsman who, pursuant to s. 47 of the Act dismissed an application by the landlord for a writ of possession. HELD: The matter will be remitted to the Rentalsman for a rehearing upon proof of service of the Notice of Hearing on all of the tenants.  1) The tenants who are named in the decision are Vernon and Ivy. There is no reference to Richie whose name appears on the tenancy agreement. 2) Even though the decision states that the Notice of Hearing was properly served, that cannot be the end of the matter given that there is nothing in the file which would indicate any directions having been given to the landlord with respect to service other than personal service. Ivy and Richie did not appear at the hearing and the decision does not even identify Richie as being one of the tenants. More is required to ensure service of and notice to all the tenants. 3) There are no notes nor is there anything in the decision which would permit the Court to conclude that the issue of service on Ivy and Richie was ever considered by the Rentalsman. The matter must be returned to the Rentalsman for a rehearing upon proof of service of the hearing on all of the tenants."

The remaining issues to be resolved were 1) what, if any, should the father pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children; 2) what retroactive support should be ordered in this matter; and 3) what interim spousal support ought to be payable by the father. HELD: 1) The father was ordered to pay an amount equal to 71% of the children's net day care costs after tax. 2) The court was satisfied on the particular needs for primary school education that the particular expense in question was a necessary expense given the child's best interests and the fact that the child support order had been made pursuant to s. 7(1)(d). The court could not make a decision regarding any extraordinary expenses for the child with ADHD because the mother had not filed enough evidence regarding that child's circumstances. The court agreed with the father that the Sylvan Learning Centre fees were significant. For one child, for 12 weeks with initial testing and consultation, the cost would be $2,522. For the other child, the father was not opposed to additional educational assistance but the father wished to speak to teachers in the fall about other programming. The father did not provide any evidence regarding any possible educational programs for the summer. It was clear the father had taken no steps to research alternatives to the program.  3) The mother's claim for the father's assistance was made under the Federal Child Support Guidelines (SOR/97-175).","FIAT: The primary issue is whether the father should pay for tutoring expenses. HELD: 1) The father is not opposed to Kody receiving some additional educational assistance. However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400."

The conversation was logically relevant to the charge and subject to exclusion under s. 24(2). There was clearly a nexus between the conversation and the substance of the charge. The accused and the complainant were obviously discussing intimate details of their relationship. The evidence was therefore inadmissible. 2)The learned provincial court judge who issued the authorization did so in error because there was no basis upon which he could conclude that there were reasonable grounds to believe that information concerning the offences would be obtained through the interception sought and, therefore, the evidence ought to be excluded. 3)The authorization provided that the offences in which private communications may be intercepted were ss.271(1) and 273.1(c). Neither of which is the offence currently charged and therefore has been breach of s.8 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the evidence obtained should be excluded pursuant to s24(1). 4)The accused raised three arguments. The first was that the learned judge did not have sufficient evidence before him to do so. The second was that there was a reasonable doubt as to whether there was any probative value to the information obtained. The third was that, having done so immediately, it was immediately evident that the contents of the communication were in fact relevant and therefore the evidence was admissible. 5)The evidence was irrelevant.  6)The trial judge was in error. He did not properly consider the nature and extent of the breach of the accused's Charter rights. He should have considered the nature of the alleged breach and the extent to which the evidence related to that breach. 7)There was no","This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute."

Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim. The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents.

However, s. 20 does not apply because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant. Section 19 of The Limitations Act applies to the original and the amended claims.

HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent in the amount of $1,000 to the applicant. The court has no jurisdiction to order a hearing to determine whether there was undue influence or to permit the use of viva voce evidence in connection with the application. There was no evidence before the court as to who was the Power of Attorney at the time of the making of the will.

She resided with her birth parents in Alberta under a temporary guardianship order issued in 2004. In 2005 an order for permanent guardianship was granted. The order contained a provision that access by the birth parents was left to the discretion of the respondents. The respondents applied to adopt the child in 2007. The birth parents, who now reside in British Columbia, were each personally served with Notice of the Adoption Hearing. Neither appeared at the hearing. The appellant appeals from that adoption order. Appeal allowed; the appellant not seeking to oppose the adoption but wants to be heard on the issue of access.

The court is not satisfied that a person, whose consent is required pursuant to s. 94(2) or (3) of the Children and Family Services Act, is deemed to have consented to the adoption. The child was not in need of protective services.","The appellant appealed the adoption order regarding her natural child. Although at one time the child had been in the permanent care of the Agency, that order was terminated and replaced by a private guardianship order which had placed the child with the now-adoptive parents. Although neither of the birth parents, who resided in British Columbia, had attended the adoption hearing, the birth mother now sought access to the child and requested that the court receive fresh evidence as to her unsuccessful efforts to obtain counsel to represent her at the adoption hearing. Appeal allowed; adoption order set aside; matter remitted to the application court for a further hearing; application to admit fresh evidence granted in part; the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing admitted into evidence. The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or to be represented at the hearing and had made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so.

52,Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,"This was an application for an order removing Joan McGean as one of the Personal Representatives of the Estate of the deceased, who died intestate in May 2007. The deceased was employed by a company for 31 years and contributed to a pension plan, which was valued at $283,237 at the time of his death. The company determined that the respondent was a spouse within the meaning of the Pension Plan for Employees and Pension Benefits Standards Act and therefore began paying survivor benefits to her. As a result of the survivor benefits being paid to the Respondent, the Estate received no monies from the company. The Estate contended that the pension should have been paid to them, rather than to the respondent. The respondent was in a position of direct conflict as the continuing payment of the benefits was an immediate benefit to her, which would be lessened if the pension were paid into the Estate and divided among all of the heirs. Application to remove the respondent as Personal Representative dismissed; the Estate may pursue a claim for payment of a lump sum pension into the estate by the company; if the respondent refused to make any payment to the Estate, she would be required to bring an action against herself, in her personal capacity, as Administrator of the estate in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The court was satisfied that it would be in the best interests of all the heirs if the applicant were removed as Personal Representatives and the pension funds were paid back to the estate.","The intestate's biological child, who was one of the personal representatives of the estate, wished to sue the intestate's former employer to have the pension to which he was entitled at the time of his death paid into the estate. The other personal representative of the estate, who was the intestate's spouse, was in receipt of survivor benefits under the pension and, as such, was opposed to the intended court action. The biological child applied to have his stepmother removed as a personal representative of the estate. Application dismissed; the removal of the personal representative would only be in the best interests of those persons interested in the estate if the intended lawsuit was feasible, which it was not. The estate was bound by the terms of the pension plan, which provided that the respondent was clearly entitled, as the spouse of the intestate, to survivor benefits and the payment of a lump sum into her estate if she died within five years of the intestate's retirement."

This order was granted, but the child's father appealed the order and sought to adduce fresh evidence to prove his fitness to parent the child.

The parties agreed to Gabrielson J. receiving the report and neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report. HELD: Leave denied. Even if there was a scintilla of merit to the argument, the Court would not grant leave to appeal on the basis that to grant leave to appeal on an extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case.

54,Issue | Issue | Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason Document : ,"This is an appeal by the Landlord from an order of the Director of Residential Tenancies which effectively permitted the Tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month one and denied the request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the tenant effectively refused to renew for another year. The original lease ran from September 1, 2007 to August 31, 2008 and was renewed for one year. About four months before the expiry of the second year, the tenant gave proper notice that he wished to convert the tenancy into one year, pursuant to the provisions of s. 10A of the Residential Tenants Act. The Landlord responded within thirty days and refused to consent, giving his reasons why he believed it was not in his interest to have a month-to-month tenancy. HELD: The Court held that the appeal was dismissed. The words 'the consent of the landlord shall not be arbitrarily or unreasonably withheld' must not be given some meaning as the Act could have, but did not make it automatic that a tenant's request to make a change from year to month would be given. The concept of consent not being unreasonially or arbitrarily withheld occurs in two contexts in the Act: in residential and commercial tenancy. Not surprisingly, there are numerous cases across Canada where the issue was a conversion from a yearly to month to a month lease and consent was not arbitrary or unreasonable. The other case is a subletting case where the landlord was able to locate the tenant in the centre of a consenting process and allows the Landlords' Office to exercise some judgment, with the constraint that it should not be arbitrary, unreasonable or in any way. In this case, the Director's order did not only permit the conversion but also effectively terminated the tenancy. The Court found that the landlord's refusal to consent was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable.","The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place."

HELD: 1) The mother was not seeking a return of the children to her directly but supported the position of the father, who asked that the children be returned to him in his care. The father proposed that he will continue living with the mother H.H. and the children while the mother first attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he proposes to address his own addiction problems.  2) The father had a substantial criminal record which included 16 offences as a youth. His youth offences were primarily property crimes, especially vehicles. The convictions for youth offences are dated between May of 2000 and June of 2004. He has four brothers and one sister and he is third in the sibling line. He is not working or in school. He shovels snow for Elders on the First Nation. He plans to return to school.

The mother and the father did not establish an early relationship until late teenagehood when they both started going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. They started living together and both were using intravenous drugs. N.O.S was using once every two weeks for the first two weeks. He stopped hanging around with gang members after his daughter was born and became involved in gang activity when he spent time in a correctional centre and after he was released because he was afraid he would be picked up by the gang members. The relationship deteriorated when the children were born and the mother got pregnant. The Ministry apprehended the children when they were two and one year old. They have been apprehended since the age of three. They are the subject of two consent orders for six and a half years. The court reviewed the children's history and assessed their needs and their development. It found that they were in need of protection and that their best interests were to remain in the custody of their father. The child had a significant risk of harm if returned to the mother. The evidence showed that the father had been involved in a number of violent crimes, including the shooting of a police officer, theft of vehicles and break and enters. The Court found that the mother was a person of sufficient interest to the children based on the evidence presented at the consent hearing and the evidence of the","The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them."

HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction."
57,Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Non_IRC Document : ,"The Court determined the income replacement benefit (IRB) for Ernest Montgrand as a non-earner as defined by the Automobile Accident Insurance Act and Personal Injury Benefits Regulations. The IRB for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident should not be less than the IRB calculated for the first 180 days after the accident, as determined pursuant to s. 117 of the Act and s. 24 of the Regulations. SGI maintains the hearing judge erred in holding that the post 180 day benefit payable pursuant to ss. 117(1), (3) and (4) of the act is not to be less that the income Replacement Benefit payable during the 180 day period. It argues that the Act is intended to correlate a victim's income replacement benefits with his or her earning reality. Therefore, the 180-day IRB against which s.117(4) is designed to be measured is that of a 'weighted average' calculation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The Court held that there was no error in law with respect to the finding of facts. Whether Montgrand's first 180 day IRB is greater or less is a matter of mathematical calculation. If it is greater, he has the benefit provided by s.119(4). 2) The hearing judge raised no concern about the validity of the weighted average approach used by SGI in calculating the post-180 day period IRB. Montgrand likewise never questioned its validity. 3) The appeal court rejected the argument that s117(3) conflicts with s116(1) as the latter is expressly subordinated to the provisions of the former. The intention is to provide two forms of income replacement: a short-term IRB pursuant to the 180 Day IRB and a long term IRB, which is the same for both the 180 and post 180 Day periods.","At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality."

She had taken a vocational training course for computers and reflexology since separation. She earned $45,073 in 2006 (including $15,000 attributed to the Safeway buyout), $23,084 in 2005, $18,275 in 2004 and $24,795 in 2003. She was receiving social assistance in the amount of $14,000 annually. The fact that the appellant had had and still carries the burden of primarily maintaining Catherine in his view is also a factor which militates against retroactive support. The marriage was one of relatively long duration. However, there was not a stellar job history and his income has fluctuated substantially. His ability to pay is modest based on his income and the fact that he is still supporting Catherine who is nearing retirement and has serious although presently manageable illness. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. Given the circumstances it would be unfair to order retroactive maintenance based on the appellant's 2007 income of $30,000 based on P-8, the respondent's exhibit. She has greater capital than the appellant and earns more than she gets on welfare. She is still feeling the effects of her illnesses but could do some part-time work. Based on her past experience she could do work at a food store but it may take her several years to find suitable full-time employment. Given Richard's financial record he is on the right track to become self-sufficient as soon as possible, it is appropriate to pay $300 per month.  1) The appellant has gone bankrupt twice and both parties both have gone on to become bankrupt twice.  2) It is not always possible to predict the future of a","The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge."

The petitioner requests that the parenting judgment be varied to provide a four day on and four day off rotation to the parenting schedule and the deletion from paragraph of parenting judgment the respondent's final decision making provision. HELD: 1) The respondent opposes the application and says that there has been no material change in circumstances since the granting of the parenting and child support orders. Therefore the petitioner's application should be dismissed. The parties never lived together. The respondent went on maternity leave in June 2005 from her position at the Calder Centre in Saskatoon. She then relocated to Regina to be with her family where the children were born. The respondents as a single parent was able to access family supports after the twins were born in Regina. 2) The petitioner resided in the city and the respondent has provided generous access to the petitioner since the birth of the twins. In October of 2005 the petitioner brought an application for joint custody, payment of child support by him and an order that the respondent provide her three previous years tax returns and notices of assessment. That application resulted in the consent mother's and father's parenting judgment. The parenting judgment provided joint custody with the children having their primary residence with the respondent. The father was to have access twelve days per month and he was to be responsible for paying her relocation costs. The mother has since relocated to Saskatoon with the petitioner having paid her costs of relocation. The children now have access 50% of the time. 3) The parties have been following an equal parenting schedule for two and one-half years. The current parenting schedule has worked wonderfully for the twins as they are healthy, happy, well cared for, and well-intentioned. The Court acknowledges that under the current parenting arrangements the petitioner acknowledges that he may seek additional parenting time with the twins, up to and including a half-time parenting arrangement such that the children would spend equal time with each parent, provided the petitioner would not seek a change in the maintenance arrangements, and would continue to provide basic Guidelines maintenance as he currently does, with no deduction based on increased parenting time. 4) The father's income for Guideline purposes was $53,624 and the mother's income was $54,581. The support order determined the petitioner was to pay child support in the amount of $762 per month plus one half of net child care costs and one half the cost of any health or dental costs not covered by insurance. 5) The","The petitioner and respondent are the parents of twins. The petitioner father sought variation of a consent order. The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent. The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner. The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children. For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time. The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children. The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis. The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come. The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children. HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement. The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children. The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement. The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order. The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased. The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed. The respondent was awarded costs."

The defendant submits that the young persons were victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted by senior students, including the plaintiffs, and that public disclosure of information in their affidavits would exacerbate the harm which has been done to them. HELD: The sealing order is granted. The court reviewed the two part test set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (SCC), [1994] S.C.R. 835 and R. v. Mentuck to determine whether restrictive publication should be ordered: the necessity to prevent serious risk to the proper administration of justice because reasonable alternative measures will not prevent the risk; and, the positive effects on the rights and interests of the parties and the public including the right to free expression. Based on my education and experience, believe that any further publication or disclosure of the details of the assaults or the related legal proceedings would add to and aggravate the psychological harm suffered by the children and their families. In particular, the dissemination of the verbal or visual evidence in the social networking sites may result in significant prejudice to the Children's privacy and sense of personal dignity. The children are particularly vulnerable to these types of personal prejudice due to their young age and the self-esteem and psychological well-being of adolescents. Furthermore, it is my view that further disclosure and publicity of the children's evidence would jeopardize their integration into Campbell Collegiate and alienate them from their peers.","The defendant applied for an order sealing the affidavits of two young people who were the victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted at a high school by senior students, including the plaintiffs. The defendant argued that public disclosure of the affidavits would exacerbate the harm that was done to the young people. The Leader-Post was granted leave to speak to the matter and opposed the application. HELD: Bearing in mind the efficacy of the high school grapevine, particularly in an electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of the young persons in their affidavits will not cause further harm to them. The public, including fellow students, have the right to know their version of the facts. However, other portions of the affidavits that refer to the effects of the assault on the young men and their ramifications to others should be sealed because there is a real risk of further harm to the young persons and to others."

The issue was whether the evidence of the Crown was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court accepted the complainant's testimony that there had been tension, arguments and yelling between them on more than one occasion prior to this alleged matter. The complainant had asked the accused to take the child out of the Jolly Jumper but when the infant ended up on the floor, having slipped from the accused's grasp, she told the accused he had dropped the baby. That led to an exchange between them, when the accused said 'no didn't drop him'. When the complainant said again that he had, the accused told her 'no, didn't f*** drop him.' The argument continued in the bedroom until the complainant went to the bathroom and locked the door, at which point the accused forced his way into the room and pushed the complainant to the floor with both hands on her chest, causing her to hit her head on either the dresser or the bed. The whole incident was over in less than five minutes.",The accused was charged with committing a common assault against his step-sister being the complainant. The question was whether the Crown's evidence was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant and whether the Crown was able to prove non-consent beyond a reasonable doubt.

The charge arose from a single motor vehicle accident. The accused was detained at the scene because the police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD). Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample and a failure reading was obtained. The ASD was dropped off at 3:10 a.m. and the accused was asked if he understood the procedure and if he needed a lawyer, which he indicated 'yes'. At 3:17 a breathalyzer demand made, the ASD was read to the accused and his Charter rights were read to him. At the police station, the accused attempted unsuccessfully to reach three different lawyers. He ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel.

The Crown alleged that the learned trial judge misapprehended the evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The Crown sought a conviction on the charge. The acquittal was not supported by the evidence. The trial judge erred in finding that the accused did not have a specific reason for buying the sword and did not usually carry weapons for protection. The sword was found in the accused's possession after he pulled up his shirt to scratch his side, exposing a sword type weapon tucked into the back of his waist band. The accused had purchased the sword for $10 from someone named 'Froggy'. As he had no bag or back pack in which to carry it, he tucked it into his shorts. He did not recall much about his encounter with the police other than standing there and looking. When asked why he didn't simply carry the sword in his hands, he replied that he didn’t want to simply call the cops on him right away as they would think about to do something about to alarm people if they knew he had the sword. The defence called a deputy sheriff, who reenacted medieval battles, to testify about his experience with items of the same type as Exhibit P-2. He identified the sword as decorative in nature and described it as a replica of a sword used in the battles of the Middle Ages. The deputy sheriff testified that he had re-enacted the battles for a group called Anachronism, which was a type of group that rekindled the memory of the events surrounding the time of the sword's manufacture. The court reviewed the trial judge’s reasons for accepting the opinion evidence submitted by the defence counsel and concluded that the judge did not err in accepting the evidence of the deputy sheriff. The appeal court found that the verdict of not guilty on the concealed weapon charge was unreasonable and not supported with respect to the evidence and that the court failed to give proper reasons for its decision.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon. The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants. At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience. No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon. The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed. The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon. The Crown appeal was dismissed."

He had signed a non-compete agreement in 1995 which prohibited him from operating a drug store within 10 miles of the plaintiffs' premises. The opening of the new business was imminent. The plaintiff applied for an interim injunction pursuant to CPR 41.04. The defendant opposed the application, arguing that the injunction should be granted in advance of a motion for interlocutory receivership. Application for interim injunction granted; although the plaintiff had not had sufficient time to gather all the evidence it wished to present on an application for a receivership, considering all of the circumstances, it was appropriate and just to issue the interim injunction. The Plaintiff's motion was not frivolous or vexatious; there was a serious issue to be tried; the Plaintiff's business risked irreparable harm; the balance of convenience favored the plaintiff. The new Rules differentiate between Interim and Interlocutory Injunction; the new Rule was contemplated when the new Rules were put in place. This is one of those rare circumstances where an injunction is appropriate, even though there are some concerns about the year duration of the noncompete clause and the chances of the Plaintiff ultimately succeeding. The Court was not satisfied that there was an urgency in the sense that the defendant had resigned only a few weeks earlier and the opening of his new store was imminent; the Court was satisfied that the Court had granted the injunction because it was the appropriate remedy in the circumstances. It was not necessary to consider the merits of the motion for a receiver's action. The court was satisfied, however, that it was in the interests of justice and the best interests of the public that an injunction be granted.","The applicant is the only drug store in a rural community. The respondent worked there for 30 years, in various positions. He signed a 5-year, 10 mile non-competition clause in 1995. He quit in early March with the intention of opening a new drug store down the street in early April. Other key staff members intended to quit and work in the new store. The applicant moved for an interim injunction to prevent the respondent from opening his store pending the hearing of their motion for an interlocutory injunction. Interim injunction granted. The new Civil Procedure Rules (2008) distinguish between interim and interlocutory injunctions. This is one of the circumstances which was contemplated when the new Rule 41.04 was enacted. Urgency exists and the applicant can't wait. While the non-competition clause may well not survive a challenge at the full hearing of the interlocutory injunction motion, all the applicant needs to show is that there is a serious issue to be tried. There is. This isn't a frivolous or vexatious application. There's a high potential for the applicant to suffer irreparable harm (e.g. the loss of customers, market share) especially given that this is a small community. An interim injunction will only result in a delay of a few weeks. The interlocutory injunction is set to heard at the end of April. The stakes are higher for the applicant than they are for the respondent."
69,Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Reason Document : ,"The Crown appealed the sentencing judge's order under s. 490.012(1) of the Criminal Code which directed Leo Harris Burns to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) for 20 years after he was convicted of four charges of sexual assault. He was sentenced to four concurrent terms of four years and eight months imprisonment (after four months credit for time served on remand) and received a ten-year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20-year SOIRA compliance order. HELD: The sentencing judge erred in law in his interpretation of s.490.013(2.1). The meaning of the section is plain: offenders who commit multiple designated offences will be subject to a lifetime SOIra compliance order which is mandatory in these circumstances. Nothing in the Code suggests the lifetime duration of the order rests on the offender being sentenced separately for each offence. The latter section speaks directly to the circumstances where an offender has been previously convicted of a designated offence and has no prior convictions for another 'designated offence'.","The accused was convicted of four counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown had proceeded by indictment and the accused was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 8 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20-year Sexual Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) compliance order. At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order. If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3). Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who committed multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or altogether."

HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The trial judge erred in holding that the police officer who made the demand for a breath sample had reasonable and probable grounds to make such a demand pursuant to Criminal Code s. 254(3)(a); in holding the appellant was provided with his right to retain and instruct counsel of his choice, without delay, and to be informed of that right as provided by s. 10 of the Charter; in finding that the taking of breath samples did not constitute an unreasonable search and seizure. The learned trial judge also erred by holding the certificate of analysis tendered by the crown was evidence of the appellant's blood alcohol concentration pursuant to section 258 of the Code and in excluding evidence of his ability to operate a vehicle impaired by alcohol or drug pursuant to s253(1)(a) on the grounds that his rights were infringed or denied pursuant to ss. 8 or 10(b). The court found that the trial judge did not err in finding the officer did not arbitrarily detain the appellant, nor did he err in holding he was not the operator or had care or control of the vehicle within the meaning of ss. 253 and 255. The court reviewed the facts of this case to determine whether the officer reasonably believed she could rely on the Certificate of Analysis to make the breath demand.","The appellant was convicted of driving over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes.

The appeal does not affect the ability of the Court to finalize the judgment. In fact, to do so will avoid costs and delay, and will hopefully be of some of assistance to the Court of Appeal."

He appeals from this sentence. The appellant contends that during the dangerous offender hearing, the judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of the two expert witnesses who both recommended that he be declared a long-term offender instead of dangerous offender. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The Court was not bound to accept the assessment by the experts. He gave more than adequate reasons for questioning the foundation the assessments were based upon. This finding, combined with his review of all of the evidence, is more than sufficient to support his conclusion that there was no'reasonable possibility of eventual control of risk in the community'. 1) The predicate offences that led to Mr. Gonzales being classified dangerous offender were two sexual assaults. Both offences occurred in May 2005. The first involved a prostitute. He punched her twice in the face, pushed her face into the floor of the van and forced her to perform oral sex on him. He then raped her three times, twice vaginally and once anally. She was able to escape. He threatened her by telling her not to run because he would be able to find her due to the fact that he had her treaty card. The second offence involved a third party. He choked her to a point where her nose bled and she almost lost consciousness. She escaped. He was arrested on June 17, 2005. He has been in custody since that time and has been convicted of both counts. He is serving a sentence of 10 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. 2 years consecutive to his sentence for the first offence. He will serve his sentence on a 1: 1) because the Court was unable to determine whether he was a high risk to re-offend; 2) because of the serious nature of the offences and their similarity to the predicate offences described by Currie in his judgment at the sentencing hearing; and 3) because he has a history of violent offences, including the use of force, threats, and threats to stab and stab wounds. There is no doubt that these offences were pre-sentence aggravating factors in the sentencing process.","The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal."

The union published a grievance defaming a former hospital director by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge found that the union and its representatives were protected by the privilege of being immune from liability. He fixed a provisional award of damages of $25,000. The former director appeals. He argues that the defamatories are protected by qualified privilege and the trial judge erred in finding that the statements are protected. He asks the Court to set aside the provisional award and fix the damages at $100,000 and for a new trial. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Court concludes that qualified privilege does not apply to statements published by the union that defame its members. The statements were made by an employee who believed that she was being harassed by some members of the faculty and some fellow Union members at the hospital and that the management was not doing enough to prevent the harassment. She filed a grievance in 2001 that was resolved in her favour. She was granted significant remedies, including the right to return to the workplace in 2005. The 2005 award was not in any way critical of the former director; rather, it noted that he had attempted to act as an advocate for her and that her return to work did not go smoothly. She complained numerous times about the harassment and complained about it to Dr. Rubin. He would arrive at work to find her in tears and she would end up in tears. In 2006, she returned to work but was harassed again by the Union. The Union published the statement of complaint in which she accused him of being part of a conspiracy to harass her. The statement was published in 2010 and the union president and grievance officer, who was the union's grievance officer at the time, played an integral role in preparing and publishing the statement. The Court finds that the Union and the Union's President and the grievance officer are entitled to be treated as if the statements were published and damages are fixed at $50,000 (see: 2010 SKQB 249 (CanLII), [2010] 12 W.W.R. 271).  2) There is no evidence that there was any attempt by either the union or the president to induce the employee to withdraw her complaint or to withdraw the complaint. The facts do not support the conclusion that the statement was made in an effort to induce her to withdraw. The","The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed."

The Chambers judge was acting in his capacity as an Administrative Judge appointed pursuant to the Court Administration Protocol (CAP) established as part of the settlement of the Indian Residential Schools litigation. In issue is approximately $20 million in legal fees, disbursements and interest which MLG is claiming, and the prospective respondent (Canada or the Government) seeks verification of the claim. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. The criteria to be considered in leave applications is firstly is the proposed appeal of sufficient merit to warrant the attention of the Court of Appeal and, secondly, is the appeal of sufficiently importance to the proceedings, the field of practice or the state of law, or to the administration of justice generally such as to warrant determination by the Court. The application arises in the context of the verification process but it will be to look at the reasons for the process itself. In determining whether the first step of verification must be considered, Canada submits that its purpose was as set out in the VA and that the statements as to the purpose were not contested by the respondent in its affidavit. Since May 2005, the Federal Representative has served as Federal Representative for the Government of Canada. In July 2008, at para 32 of the VA has been completed, the sections of the affidavit refer to a meeting between the Government and the respondent. The purpose of the meeting was to determine whether the documents referred to in the affidavit should be verified. The Government seeks to establish that the documents refer to the Government's position in relation to the documents. In the documents, the Government argues that the Government is not a party to the case. In this case, the documents relate to a settlement agreement entered into in 2005 between Canada and the plaintiff, which was not contested at the time. As part of this settlement agreement, the parties entered into a verification agreement with respect to the verification of legal fees and disbursement. The parties are disputing the terms of the agreement and each had made an application to the Administrative Judge for directions. The order of the Chambers orders the respondent to contact ESI Software, Inc. and arrange for ESI to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as whole from the 'live data' in the respondent's present billing program. The respondent argues the impugned order was a discretionary one attracting a deferential standard of review. The issue before the Court is whether the order was","The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable. The prospective appellant failed to establish that there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings or to the field of practice, the state of law or the administration of justice to warrant a determination by the Court."

The accounting records did not show it as a wages advance and the back of the cheque did not indicate where it was deposited. The $2,000 referred to in the counterclaim was a deduction from his cheque which was used to buy a car. The plaintiff corporation owner testified that he had given the defendant one thousand dollars cash and that they had to pay it back. When the thousand dollar cheque was paid back, the defendant paid it back in order to repay the loan. This does not make sense as one would expect that if it was a cash advance it would simply be deducted from the defendant's wage and shown as an advance. This is not recorded this way in the plaintiff's records filed as exhibits. In addition, the accounting records do not show the loan as being paid back. The Court was not convinced that the defendants received $5,000 each as the front of the three cheques were filed as an exhibit. Lilia Turcan testified that she was not involved in any discussions as to the giving of these funds to her husband. She testified that her husband brought the cheques home, asked her to sign it and then gave it back to her understanding that it had been a gift. The parties testified that they never discussed the money in any way. The return of the $1000 was simply a repayment of the advance. The defendant was asked to sign and return it and he did. The court found that the defendant was on salary and since he was not paying wages it could not have been an advance as it should have been recorded in his paycheque in September, October or November. The loan was not recorded as a loan as there was no record of it being made out. The defendants were not given the loan by the plaintiff corporation.","HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance."

The accused sought to be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d), the exceptional power to commit a young person to custody reserved for those circumstances where, in effect, any other order would undermine the purpose and principles of sentencing set out in s. 38. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. The Court found that with this not being a violent offence, and with his limited criminal record, the accused was not subject to custody under the Act’s provisions. With regard to the second count, the Court held that the accused did wilfully refuse to attend youth court within the province unless with the prior permission of the Court, which would constitute a breach of s. 137(1). The Court sentenced the accused to two months consecutive incarceration on each count, to be served in a youth correctional institute, and ordered that he remain subject to the terms of his youth probation.","The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender."
77,Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,HELD: The court dismissed the applications. It held that it did not believe that there was a prima facie case to be made out in respect of the issues raised by the affidavits filed by the plaintiff in its proposed class action. The affidavits were not so closely related to the claims as to constitute sworn statements. The court found that it was unable to determine whether the statements were made in response to questions posed by the defendant bank officers or were the subject of sworn affidavits. It declined to order a cross-examination of any of the witnesses.,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. The information contained in the affidavits was uncontroverted and a matter of public record. MLG was unable to explain how cross-examination would assist the Court. As well, the application to cross-examine did not appear to rest on a real need to clarify any issues relevant to the application for which the affidavits had been filed and focused on the relative merits of legal issues rather than on evidentiary issues."

(Clarke), answer certain questions which they refused to answer on discovery; provide answers now, based upon their present knowledge, to questions which the defendants say are best left to be answered on completion of their discovery of the plaintiff when they will have better information; and provide proper answers responsive to certain questions asked. The application raises interesting issues with respect to the proper scope of questioning or examination for discovery, which will be addressed in the analysis below. HELD: 1) The questions referred to in the undertakings are not questions of discovery but of investigation. The proper forum for such questions is to be asked of the proper officer of CN.  2) Clarke is liable in both contract and negligence. Clarke denies any breach of contract or negligence, but says that if there was any breach, it was not the cause of the derailment. In the alternative, Clarke pleads contributory negligence and in any event puts CN to strict proof of the damages allegedly suffered. 3) There is no evidence to suggest that Clarke has any facts or information that suggests the derailments was caused by the movement of the steel coils in the car, or that there is any evidence of improper loading by Clarke prior to the car being loaded by CN. 4) There was no evidence that any of the 445 railcars identified by CN as previously loaded by Clarke had in fact been loaded by the defendant. 5) Clarke provided the bulk of its responses by January of 2012. A follow-up examination is scheduled for November. 6) The court was asked to rule regarding three distinct categories of questions asked, but designated as undertakings. Undertakings 18, 32, 33 and 38 relate to questions regarding Clarke’s knowledge of the circumstances in which the railcar derailed. The questions in this category were in response to a request by the plaintiff for information regarding the manner in which steel coils were positioned and secured in a railcar and what evidence there exists on this topic; who was involved in the loading and what recollections they have; and a detailed compilation of invoices and other evidence of expenditures by CN that all relate to damages it suffered. Undertaking 28, 39 and 53 relate to the questions in which Clarke was asked whether or not it had any background information, documents or factual information that went into the preparation of the sketch of the car in question.  Undertaking 32 and 33 relate to reviewing binder documents and other documents assembled","HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers."

The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this calendar year. He opposes the move, and in any event wants access. HELD: 1) The mother's unilateral move was unfortunate. While she claims that she reversed this move and went back to Nokomis, the father harbours suspicions that she and the children actually remained in Kenaston. For example, the custody/access evaluator interviewed the older child who was identified as teaching at Kenaston school. There was no satisfactory explanation as to why this child was attending school in that location. General principles apply. There are some general principles that must be dealt with. The decision in Gordon v. Goertz, CanLII 191 (SCC), is apposite. 2) When an application is made to an interim court on a significant caution, it is warranted. 3) In any event, should the children have access with their father while he is incarcerated? The father was charged with a number of criminal matters in the fall of 2012. He was sentenced in October. His latest affidavit is not entirely clear on how long he will be in jail, but states that he is eligible for early release in December 2013. We thus know he'll be in prison for the rest of this year, and perhaps beyond. The mother has formed a new relationship and is pregnant. She has unilaterally moved with the children to Kenaston, notwithstanding an existing order of this court. She maintains that she has, in actuality, already moved and her request is but a formality.","The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant. She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse. The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year. The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail. The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children. The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time."

The court also found that the judge made a palpable and overriding error in interpretation of the evidence and calculation of damages. The plaintiff had proven liability with respect to a small amount of damage to a concrete grade beam which was not part of the claim but was awarded damages for repair of the beam and for other repairs in an amount much higher than what would have been awarded for the damage to the beam, notwithstanding that liability was not established at trial. The respondent purchased the house from the appellants in 2007. In 2010, following a large rainstorm, he saw water entering the basement of the house. When he removed the interior north wall in the basement, he found a second wall behind the first wall had been damaged. A large chunk of the concrete footing and a wooden beam were broken and had slid into the space behind the second wall. The wall was removed and the plaintiff was advised that the main triple-ply wooden beam which had sat upon the concrete beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. He entered into contract with Mighty Joe's Contracting to have the north foundation replaced, including the wooden beam. The contract price was $19,265.40 plus electrical, plumbing, and insulation supplies for a total cost of $19.606.74. In 2012, the plaintiff commenced an action in the Provincial Court Civil Division in which he claimed judgment in the amount of $18,919.74 plus pre-judgment interest in the respondent's claim in May 2012. In August 2012, a Provincial Court judge held that there was a structural defect in the house during the time that the Richardsons owned the house and denied all responsibility for the cost of repairs. In a written decision dated August 20, 2012 the judge found that statements made in the disclosure statement were misleading and had been relied upon by the respondent in covering up the wall of old retaining wall of the basement wall of his house which was leaking. The judge also found the plaintiff had not proven liability for the cause of the leaking and awarded the plaintiff damages in the sum of $17,742.19. The defendant appealed. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the judgment is set aside.  1) The court reviewed the case law on the issue of whether there was an error in the trial process. The trial judge","The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation."

It held that s. 7(2) and 7(3) of the Court of Queen’s Bench Act, 2000 did not provide a limited right of appeal to this Court when the Psychologists Act, 1997 is silent on the question. It found that an appeal from a decision of the Saskatchewan College of Psychologists council to a judge of this Court was not necessary to be within the meaning of s. 36 of the Act. The Act does not enlarge the rights of appeal contained in the Act, but merely provides a means by which a member whose conduct is subject of an order of the council may appeal that order to the court within 30 days.","HELD: The court dismissed the application. Section 7(2) indicates that whenever the legislature confers jurisdiction on the Court of Queen’s Bench, and is silent with respect to an appeal from that Court, an appeal lies from it. The Psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench."
82,Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Issue | Conclusion | Conclusion Document : ,"HELD: The court dismissed the application. It held that the Sykes had not proven that the Labuick claim was frivolous or vexatious; that the plaintiff had no legal right to bring the application; and that the claim did not disclose a reasonable cause of action. The court reviewed the nature, severity and duration of the interference, the character of the neighbourhood, the sensitivity of the plaintiff’s use of his land and the utility of the activity and found that the interference must be substantial and the harm must be intolerable to an ordinary person.","The Court allowed the application in part. It struck the portion of the claim with respect to damages from debris falling from the defendants’ tree. Even if proven, the damages were part of urban life. The plaintiff claimed for injunctive relief ordering the trees to be removed. The Court had no jurisdiction to grant this relief. The amended claim could proceed limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees into the plaintiff’s property and whether the trees invaded the plaintiff’s air space."
83,Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,HELD: Appeal allowed. A new trial was ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred in refusing to grant an adjournment of the trial to allow a proper assessment of the documents disclosed by Crown counsel in the two days prior to the trial. The trial judge did not provide sufficient information to enable him to make an informed decision. The Court ordered the new trial on the basis that it was not in a position to assess the relevance of the disclosed documents.,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure."
84,Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"HELD: The application was allowed. The court held that it would not issue an order staying the execution of spousal support arrears created as a result of an interim order which provided for ongoing support for the appellant’s wife in the amount of $10,000 per month; gave her exclusive possession of the family home; provided for shared parenting of their three-year-old son; and awarded child support of $2,726 per month. The appellant had made all of the payments required by the order except for the $4,476 in spousAL support which had been ordered by the Chambers judge. The respondent had filed garnishees to collect those arreARS. The application for a stay of execution was based on the argument that there was no evidence to support the finding that the appellant had stopped paying the bills for the matrimonial home at the end of October 2015 as he had indicated in his statement of claim. As the respondent had paid the bills in each of the three months prior to that date, the appellant argued that he should be credited up to and including January 2016 for his payments with respect to the home and there was merit to his argument that given the brief duration of the marriage (three years) and given the respondent was unemployed, she would have no ability to repay any of the support ordered and thus had no income at the time of the application and that the main asset, pursuant to the Family Property Division Act, was the home valued at $700,000.","HELD: The application was allowed and the stay of the enforcement of retroactive spousal support was granted. There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support. If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced. The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support."
85,Conclusion | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Reason Document : ,"HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of both charges. The Court believed that the evidence presented by the Crown and the evidence of the accused as to the hours in which he was allegedly viewing child pornography and that the images were obtained by means of a peer to peer file sharing network. The accused was found to have in his possession child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(4.1) of the Criminal Code. The Internet Child Exploitation Unit (ICE Unit) conducted the investigation. The officer testified that investigations of child pornography are usually initiated by either complaints or by monitoring file sharing networks for subjects who are accessing, possessing, or sharing child pornography using file sharing software on the Internet. He testified that in most cases when people are receiving information from the Internet they’re contacting a specific site and downloading information from that site that is stored on a server at that site. In contrast, persons accessing the centralized server model are accessing the same server, the same Internet address, and obtaining the same information from same physical location. This is a very different set up to that used in the peer-to-peer model.","HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt."
86,Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Reason Document : ,"HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The accused had not established, on a balance of probabilities, that there had been a breach of his right to be tried within reasonable time. The chronology of events and court appearances was crucial to the disposition of the case and the application. It is important to note that the accused has been in custody since June 11, 2012 and the preliminary hearing date was vacated on March 16, 2016. The Court reviewed the Charter application and concluded that it would be inappropriate to interfere with the trial of the accused on the basis of a delay in bringing this matter before a Provincial Court Judge.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay. As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered. The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay. The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable."
87,Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration of alcohol in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams in one hundred millilitres of blood contrary to S.255(1). The Court believed that the ASD demand was made at 00:51 hours, the breathalyzer test administered at 01:06 hours, and the accused place under arrest at 1:07 hours. The accused indicated that he understood his right to counsel, but that he did not wish to call a lawyer. When asked again if he wanted to call counsel, the accused again declined to do so. The Court reviewed the ASD test results and concluded that the readings were within the range for the accused’s ability to operate a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. It was not necessary for the ASD to be administered within the prescribed time frame as the accused had been observed for approximately two and one-half minutes.","HELD: The accused was not guilty of either charge. Although the accused was lawfully stopped, the roadside demand was valid and the accused declined to exercise his right to counsel on two occasions following his arrest, the observation period at the detachment was not conducted properly. The officer was sometimes focused on other things. As the observation period comprised part and parcel of a breath test, the breathalyzer test was not properly administered and the Crown could not rely on the accuracy of the readings."
88,Conclusion | Conclusion | Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Conclusion Document : ,"HELD: The court dismissed the action. It found that the defendants had not proven that the defamatory comments were made with malice, deliberate calculation or recklessness but that the words complained of formed part of a series of fair and accurate contemporaneous reporting of the civil jury proceedings in a previous case involving the same doctor. The court found that such words fell under the umbrella of “responsible communication” and that such statements fell within the category of acceptable news-gathering material. The defendants did not publish a retraction or apology nor had they removed the alleged offensive articles from their websites. The plaintiff’s professional and civic reputation had not been damaged irreparably by the publication of these comments. As the doctor had decided to move from Lloydminster to Dawson Creek because he was unable to find a job in Edmonton, the newspaper published an article entitled “Botched Surgery Leaves a Small Bowel in the Operating Room” in which the surgeon described the patient as having been “licenced open” when there was only a small 2-millimetre puncture in her small bowel. The surgeon removed a small portion of the bowel, which caused the patient to go into cardiac arrest and she had to be airlifted to Edmonton where she underwent surgery to have both hands and feet amputated. She suffered some brain damage and spent a year in the hospital and at a rehabilitation centre before returning to live in a care home. The doctor had done many tubal ligations and the surgery appeared to go well and the patient was discharged later that day. She was rushed back to the hospital two days later suffering from septic shock. The patient filed a claim against the doctor and the hospital in October 1999 alleging negligence. In March 2000 an article appeared in the newspaper describing the surgeon as having ignored the patient when he came out of the operating room but he ignored her and left her to die in the intensive care unit. The article was published shortly after the patient filed an action against the surgeon, the hospital, the nurses and the newspaper.","HELD: The action was allowed. The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000. The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced. It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages."
89,Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,HELD: The action was dismissed. The court found that there was no express or implied agreement to allow the plaintiff to charge a minimum three hour call out fee or to charge for the time it took to source and obtain parts. It ordered the defendant to pay the difference between the principal and accrued interest on the principal amount claimed and the amount claimed for prejudgment interest and legal costs.,"HELD: On the basis of the evidence presented by the parties’ experts and in absence of an express term in the contract, the court read in an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price and awarded the plaintiff such portion of the amount sought as was fair and reasonable. The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work."
90,Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason Document : ,"The plaintiff brought an action for breach of contract claiming damages against the defendant for alleged inducement by the defendant to enter into an agreement whereby the plaintiff would be retained to conduct a marketing study of the Montreal and eastern Canadian market for the defendant's use of funds to finance a drilling program. The defendant hired the plaintiff's principal officer as its fund development officer to represent to the plaintiff that capital in the amount of $75,000 was readily available, and that the only obligation of the plaintiff was to introduce potential investors to the defendant and explain to them the advantages of investing with the defendant. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $31,500 plus costs of the action.  1)There was no misrepresentation of the agreement. The plaintiff accepted the terms of the contract with respect to the fee for the marketing study and the time frame for which it was retained. 2)The plaintiff was entitled to its costs on a party and party basis.","The Plaintiff contracted to provide market survey to the Defendant. Before its completion, the contract was replaced by second contract for Fund Development Officer. Each party had a different understanding of the duties of the Fund Development Officer which misunderstanding the Judge classified as a mutual mistake. The failure of performance by plaintiff entitled defendant to repudiate the contract. Defendant's counterclaim for rescission of first agreement, and repayment of monies paid under second agreement, failed where it accepted plaintiff's performance and paid consideration therefore."

The respondent was in charge of the family finances when the parties married in 1964. The family owned a modest home and equity in the home of approximately $16,000. In 1977, the respondent won $100,000 in a lottery and purchased a house, furniture and household goods worth $65,000, a mini-motor home and other items. The business failed and the family had to repossess the property. The applicant complained about the respondent's use of alcohol. HELD: 1)The respondent mismanaged the family financial affairs and the property should not be divided equally. The money spent on the family and in the trenching business was not dissipated within the meaning of the Act. He was entitled to keep his 1977 Mercury motor vehicle and his tools and other properties in his possession as his own. 2)The applicant's share of the proceeds of sale of the house and lot in Hague were to be $12,240 and $8,000 respectively and the respondent was to pay arrears of child support in the amount of $1,800. 3)The court was satisfied that the respondent, at times, abused alcohol and spent more money on alcohol than he should have but he did not lose his licence and did not miss work because of his consumption.","Division of matrimonial property. Husband made modest living and, eight years ago, won $100,000 in lottery. The lottery money was spent on household finances and lost in husband's small business venture. Husband 'spent more money on alcohol than he should have'. HELD: This did not amount to dissipation of matrimonial property within the meaning of the Act. Husband's mismanagement of the family's financial affairs was grounds for unequal division of the property:"

The parties entered into a written year to year lease in standard form which commenced in March 1989 with rent at the rate of $500.00 per month. The appellant increased the rent to $515.00 on May 1, 1989, which increase was somewhat reluctantly accepted by the respondents. By virtue of its terms, the lease automatically renewed for a further term of 1 year from March 1990 provided that neither gave notice of termination to the other at least 3 months prior to the annniversary date of the lease. The respondents chose not to exercise this option and objected to the rental increase and made application to the Halifax and County Residential Tenants Board for determination as to whether or not the increase was valid. The Board heard the matter and rendered its decision on July 19, 1990. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the order based on the Board's decision, that the decision and recommendation of the Board is set aside without costs to any party.","The issue in this appeal was whether a landlord can give notice of a rental increase at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease.

For the appellant, that notice of a rental increase may be given at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease."
95,Issue | Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason Document : ,"This was an appeal pursuant to s. 19 of the Health Services Tax Act in respect to a decision of the Provincial Tax Commission to cancel a claim for a refund of health services tax by the applicant, Continental Seafoods Ltd. The applicant had applied to the Commission for refund of the tax paid on certain refrigeration equipment which was installed in a new facility for pickled whole herring. This product was mainly to be supplied on contract to the Soviet Union. The contract contained stringent quality specifications governing the processing of this product which included a phase where the pickling occurred in a cooler facility for 28 to 45 days at a strictly controlled temperature of 0ºC to 2ºC. The plant was to be used both for production and also for storage of products produced elsewhere by Continental or its related companies. When pickled herring was not being processed, the refrigeration was used to provide air conditioning and cold storage capacity for Continental or these companies. In 1988 Continental contracted with J.H. Lock Sons Limited to furnish the labour, materials and equipment for the refrigerations system in the plant. Germain Mechanical and Electrical Limited acted as a subcontractor for J.h. Lock to complete the contract work on the refrigerating system. It also contracted directly with Continental for various electrical and mechanical plumbing tasks. In 1989, Continental applied for a return of the $58,791 paid on the equipment, which included work done by the two contractors. The provincial tax commission advised Continental that the refund claim had been 'cancelled as the contract was for New Cold Storage System which does not qualify for exemption under s. 10(1)(h)(I)"". Relevant parts of this section read as follows: 10(a) The following classes of tangible personal property are specifically exempted from the provisions of this Act: nan (h) machinery and apparatus and parts thereof which are to be use or which are used in the manufacture or production of goods for sale; (j) materials consumed or expended by the manufacture of goods or for the purpose of sale, purchased, converted, or incorporated into goods for the purposes of sale; s. 1(ca) provides for the conversion of raw or prepared material into a different state or form, but does not include production or processing; 10(h) and s. 2(c) of the Act refer to the'manufacture or transformation' means of production or conversion, which are exempt from taxation.","The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act. The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product."

He was sentenced to four years for the armed robbery, to be served consecutively, and one year for the weapons offence to be consecutive to the sentence for the first offence, plus a ten year prohibition from having firearms, ammunition and explosives for ten years, as provided by s.100(1) of the Criminal Code. Appeal dismissed. The trial judge considered the serious nature of the offences and the necessity of deterring this kind of criminal conduct and took into account, as a mitigating factor, that Mr. Bourgeois had pled guilty at the first opportunity, and accepted the recommendations of the Crown and the defence for sentencing.","The appellant contended the trial judge erred in sentencing him to four years for an armed robbery charge, one year on a weapons charge to be served consecutively and a 10 year prohibition order because there were extenuating circumstances which should have resulted in a reduction in sentence.

97,Issue | Conclusion | Reason Document : ,"This was an appeal from a decision declaring that the respondent Guardian was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant Hartford. The Province of Nova Scotia entered into a contract with Fraser Brace for the construction of a hospital. The contract allocated the risk for fire loss to the respondent and required it to obtain fire insurance to protect the parties against fire loss. The insured was Delta with the loss payable to the Province. Hartford sought contribution from the respondent's insurer, Guardian. Without acknowledging liability, Guardian paid some $400,000 to Hartford to facilitate progress payments to Delta. The respondent appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no evidence that Delta caused the fire. There was no tortious or contractual liability of Delta for which Guardian was required to respond as Delta's insurer. The policy provided that the insurance attached when the property became at the risk of the insured. On these facts Guardian had no obligation to respond. Furthermore, there was a no contractual relationship between Guardian and the Province nor between guardian and Hartford which could give rise to any obligation on Guardian's part to contribute towards the fire loss suffered by the Province and insured by Hartford.","This was an appeal of a decision declaring that the respondent was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant.

An interim order granted the wife exclusive possession of the parties' farm home with the exception of the tool shed and other parts of the farm yard which the husband was required to enter for the purpose of farming. Both were ordered to have no contact with the other and he was ordered to pay $2,000.00 lump sum support for the children at the end of the 1994 harvest. It appears that the husband undertook to pay periodic child support if he got a job off the farm but has continued to dispose of farm machinery and the 1994 crops. The wife now asks that she be paid half the value of the crop, $200 per month for each child retroactive to July 1, and that her husband be denied the right to enter the toolshed and farm yard now that he is finished farming for the year. HELD: 1)The evidence presented by the wife is simply her assertion that the Husband has been earning money which enables him to support his children. He denies it. The Court was not prepared to vary or extend the order of May27 and the extended order of October 19 which forbids the husband from approaching the home quarter. 2)The Court was willing only to direct that the Registrar allot an apre-trial date acceptable to both parties.","The Wife sought an interim distribution of matrimonial property and periodic maintenance for the 2 children of the marriage, aged 16 and 13.

The appellant argued the judge erred in law in misapprehending the evidence and in failing to have regard to or direct herself to all of the evidence bearing on the relevant issues; in that the judge failed to direct herself in law as to the appropriate burden of proof in a criminal case; in holding the appellant's ability to operate the vehicle was impaired within the meaning of s.253(a) of the Criminal Code and in using the absence of evidence from the appellant to conclude he was impaired and therefore fell into error. Dismissing the appeal, that the only reasonable explanation offered was that the accused was impaired by his ability to drive and that his speech was slurred, his eyes were bloodshot and his pupils were open and dilated. This was a very different explanation of the accident from that established by the Crown from the evidence of the witness who said she was slowing down to turn right at an intersection when her vehicle was struck from behind. The trial judge found the appellant had not been drinking since 6:00 p.m. and that he only said 'I was driving in a straight line and this girl pulled out in front of me.'","The appellant appealed his conviction for impaired driving, contending the trial judge failed to direct herself in law as to the appropriate burden of proof. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge applied the correct test for impairment. The Criminal Code does not prescribe special tests for determining impairment. The trial judge must receive sufficient evidence to satisfy him or herself beyond reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. On Appeal."
102,Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,"This was an appeal against a decision of the trial judge finding the appellant's rights under s. 7 and 8 of the Charter had been breached when she found the appellant had refused to provide a blood sample to a police officer who had asked him if he had been drinking and when the accident had occurred as this information might be important to the treatment of his injuries. The doctor had not obtained the consent of the appellant to release this information or any other information about the accident. Dismissing the appeal, that the evidence did not support the conclusion that the appellant was inebriated at the time the blood was taken, nor did the written summary of the events form an essential part of the case. The trial judge erred in finding that the doctor's actions were not subject to the Charter. The appellant was not, unlike Dersh, an agent of the state, but rather a patient whose actions were solely for the purposes of obtaining medical treatment.","This was an appeal from a trial court decision questioning whether the trial judge erred in determining that the appellant's rights under s.7 and s.8 of the Charter had not been violated. When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital. As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain. The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter. The trial judge did not err in determining that the appellant's rights were not violated under either s.7 or s.8 of the Charter."

The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including adivorce, joint custody of their children and an equal division of property. HELD: 1)The petitioner was granted exclusive possession of the matrimony home and interim custody. The parties disagreed on the value of the home. On the evidence, it was worth $121,000. The petitioner contended she should have sole custody while the respondent suggested joint custody. 2)The parties agreed that the children should reside with the petitioner for the present with access to the respondent on alternate weekends and one evening visit every two weeks. The children were doing well in school and the petitioner expressed a willingness to help with school activities. The boys each had a problem which made parenting more difficult. Although Levi attended a remedial program, he was allergic to tobacco and there was a ventilated room in his home where he would smoke if he was required to. 3)The respondent was ordered to pay $400 per month in child support which was reduced by half when he took a leave of absence from his employment with the Provincial Government.  4)The court found that the respondent was responsible for the substantial portion of the costs of the parties' joint custody costs. The court awarded the respondent $1,000 per month for child support. 5)It was found that there was no evidence to show that the petitioner was the primary caregiver for the children. 6)There was no order as to costs. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the amount of $500.","The petitioner sought a divorce, custody, spousal and child support and an unequal division of matrimonial property. The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother with access on the same terms as contained in the interim order. Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children. Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job. It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support. 2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence. She suffered an economic disadvantage from the marriage and its breakdown. 3)The car owned by the petitioner when she married was exempt property. The motorcycle was disregarded as there had not been a significant increase in value. The list prepared by the respondent was used to divide household goods, tools and equipment. 4)The respondent was to assume one-half of the bank loan and it was agreed that the pension funds should be shared equally. 5)It would be unfair and inequitable to the custodial parent to order an equal division of the matrimonial property. The petitioner was granted possession of the matrimonial home until the younger child's 18th birthday or until she vacated the property. 6)The respondent cannot avoid his responsibility of providing an adequate level of support by turning his back on well-paid employment. Spousal and child support were deducted from his share of the matrimonial home. The petitioner was given leave to return to Court after February 28, 1999 for reconsideration of child support."

The defence took the position that the witness was not adverse, but was now telling the truth after lying about certain matters in her statement;(2)the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness;(3)the oath was not administered prior to the taking of the statement, and there was no warning provided at that time, of the perjury consequences of lying. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the Crown in the amount of $1,000. 1)The witness was given the standard police cautions and her rights with respect to legal counsel upon her arrest and was co-operative from the outset. She was given a promise that if convicted of possession for the purpose of trafficking, she would let the prosecutor know that she was pregnant and that her children would not insist on locking her up until the trial. 2)The statement did not meet the threshold of reliability set out in R. v. K.G.B. (1993) because it was not made in good faith. It was made under duress and with the intention of obtaining a confession. 3)The evidence was not admissible as substantive evidence at trial.","FIAT. The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability."
105,Conclusion Document : ,"The applicant applies for an order that the respondents be prohibited from any further proceedings or actions in relation to the formal complaint against him alleging that he is guilty of conduct unbecoming a barrister and solicitor. The application is made pursuant to The Legal Profession Act, 1990 on the ground that the Discipline Committee of the Law Society of Saskatchewan does not have jurisdiction to proceed with further proceedings against the applicant on the complaint by virtue of the fact that the decision of the Hearing Committee was not provided to the chairperson of the discipline committee within 45 days after the hearing as required by s.53(1) of the Act. HELD: 1)The applicant was convicted of theft and fraud in 1991 and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment and ordered to pay compensation to the victims of his crimes. The appeal was dismissed by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in 1993. The applicant then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for a stay of the disciplinary proceedings on the grounds that those proceedings should be stayed until the criminal matter was complete. The stay was granted August 29, 1989 but was lifted in January 1990 to allow counsel for the Investigation Committee to examine a witness who was terminally ill. In 1992 on his undertaking to refrain from the practice of law, the applicant was granted an inactive membership in the LSS on January 1, 1993. As a result of his non-payment of inactive membership fees, he did not pay the inactive membership fee for the years 1988-1991 inclusive. 2)The Hearing Committee found that each of the 12 complaints filed by the applicant were well founded and that because the law society presented no evidence on counts 11 and 13, the complaints were dismissed as being unfounded. 3)The hearing was adjourned from time to time as the matter proceeded through the courts.","HELD: The last two sentences were to be substituted by the appeal was dismissed by the SCC on March 21, 1995 and the Hearing Committee set August 8, 1995 as the date for a hearing."

Three crown witnesses and five defence witnesses testified as to the altercation in the bar. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The self-defence argument was not accepted. Neither s.34 or s.37 of the Criminal Code justified the assault. 2)The testimony of the Crown witnesses was accepted. The complainant was no threat to the accused in his inebriated state and the accused took advantage of the situation to administer a beating to him.

Business Centre Inc. (VIP) or Sask. Ltd. (Sask. Ltd.) on such conditions as the Court deems proper. By lease indenture dated August 14, 1992 it leased 8,787 square feet of office space to VIP for a term of five years ending on August 31, 1997. By written agreement Bennett extended the VIP head lease to August 31st 1999. VIP operated a business center in its premises which included sub-leasing individual offices to clients and providing them with a receptionist and the use of miscellaneous office equipment. In August of 1996, Bennett asked VIP to move its business centre and sub-lessees to another part of the Plaza in order to create a large block of space which Bennett proposed to lease to Corrections Canada. Ms. Peddle, an officer of VIP, then asked the applicants to relocate to offices located in the area substituted by Bennett. Mr. Remai of Capital Properties responded to her request by fax message dated September 9, 1996 confirming the applicants' willingness to move to a specific location within VIP's new premises on terms stated therein. Subparagraph of his fax read: We will re-do the leases providing for our current rate to continue to the expiration of the lease you have just renewed. Further, we would appreciate renewal that relates to your renewal, if you exercise it firstly, and secondly, at a rate that will be no more than your percentage increase in both the base rent and the operating. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The applicants were awarded costs of the application in the amount of $1,500. 2)The court found that the applicants were entitled to their costs on a party and party basis.  3)No costs were ordered on the respondent.","The applicants sought an order under s.11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-lease with either VIP Business Centre (VIP) or 598710 Saskatchewan Ltd (SaskLtd). Bennett, owner of an office building (the Plaza), leased space to VIP for five years ending in 1997. Issues included (i)whether there had been a valid renewal of the head lease; (ii)whether there had been valid renewals of sub-leases; (iii)assuming valid renewals, did s4 of the Statute of Frauds bar enforcement against Bennett; (iv)whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear an application for relief under s11 brought solely by notice of motion; (v)are the applicants entitled to such relief; (vi)whether Bennett was bound by the sub-leases by virtue of taking the assignment from VIP. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It was assumed that the evidence led by the applicants was true in order to determine issues (iii) and (iv) which dispose of the application. Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits. 2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion. There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this Court than the tenants concerning possession of demised premises. The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry. Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle. grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion. They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease. The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine. In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically. The applciants could obtain other office space including that offered by Bennett. General and punitive damages would provide an adequate remedy."

It would be dangerous to set a precedent that would allow an application to be successful because of the circumstances that have occurred post-bankruptcy. An improved financial situation should not be used as a criterion. 2)The bankrupt would be entitled to an automatic discharge on November 15, 1998 if he complies with the requirements of the Act. 3)Once again the bankrupt must cooperate with the trustee in order to qualify for an early discharge.","The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy on the grounds that he received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and because his assets had been undervalued. He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants. The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors. Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000. The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy. The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy.

It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances. An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application. 2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate.

The children continue to live with the applicant, who has remarried and babysits in her home. The applicant has claimed child support in accordance with the guidelines and in addition makes a claim for s. 7 expenses. The total cost of orthodontic work for Kurtis is $3,900.

This suggests that the respondent should deduct $1,713.00 from his T1 income for the three years of 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998. 3)There is no adverse inference drawn against the respondent if the farming partner's financial records do not draw any adverse inference against him for failing to file the financial records of his farming partner, his brother. 4)Under s. 19(2) of the guidelines, the reasonableness of an expenses deduction is not solely governed by whether the deduction is permitted under the Income Tax Act. 5)The evidence before the court can determine the facts upon which to base an order. On the evidence before it, the court is of the opinion that on the basis of this evidence there is no evidence of unreasonable expenses and the court may impute income where there is evidence of unreasonably high expenses.  6)The court was of the view that it would be appropriate to order the respondent to pay $2,800.00 per month in child support for the two children.","An application for variation of child support pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines including an amount for extraordinar expenses of $3,900 for orthodontic work.

The psychiatrist who treated the mother states the mother is unlikely to have future suicide attempts and has responded well to treatment. The child was with the mother every afternoon during her hospitalization and the mother bonded with her son. The father is currently employed at Ipsco on shift work and is currently living with his parents. The father has had the child since the separation and the child has had little access with his mother. HELD: The child's primary residence should be with the mother. Based on the information before the Court, the mother has always been the primary caregiver of the child and remained at home with the child for the first year of his life. The mother was responsible for the child's day to day needs, health care and child care. As well the father asserts that he was involved in the child's health care needs but was unable to name the child's pediatrician. The father will have access to the child for three days when he is not working including overnight access. The father's gross annual income is $48,897 which results in a payment to the mother for child maintenance in the sum of $393.00 payable on the first day of each and every month until further ordered by the Court. In addition the father will responsible for 75% of the child care expenses."

She was terminated from her employment with KPMG after one month's pay in lieu of notice for wrongful dismissal. She sued for damages against the employer and the person who had started the quality assurance practice.

The brothers, Gene, Merle and Lorne, each formed a new company at that time with Gene owning Fairview Farms and Merle owning M.S.D. Enterprises. The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by Lorne's company. HELD: The action was dismissed with taxed costs. 1)Each brother received one-third of all the assets owned at the time by the parent company. 2)The agreement provided that there were a number of conditions precedent to the new reorganization. It provided that the dairy operation would be retained by the brothers with Lorne retaining the operation; Merle would own and run the trailer park and gravel pit operation; and Gene would take the beef cattle and be set up on a new farm called the Stiles Farm.","The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales. The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties."

One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed."

The defendant resisted the joinder of the new plaintiffs and the amendments on the basis of undue delay on the part of the proposed plaintiff and actual prejudice to the defendant. HELD: The application was allowed.  1) The limitation period for joining an infant as a plaintiff had not yet commenced when the amendments were filed. 2) The defendant did not file a statement of defence to this claim nor an intent to defend. The reasons it did not are not disclosed in the material.

The delay was caused in part by the failure of the defendant to serve notice of its intention to defend on the plaintiffs.  13) No prejudice was shown to the City.  14) The","FIAT. It was held in an earlier fiat in June that the addition of the two proposed plaintiffs asserted new causes of action and amendments to the statement of claim could only be considered pursuant to an application under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act. The defendant resisted the joinder of the new plaintiffs and amendments on the basis of undue delay and actual prejudice. The statement of claim alleged nuisance, and in the alternative, negligence against the City with respect to the design, construction and maintenance of the sewer system causing his basement to flood. The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time. Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied. The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes. HELD: The amendments were allowed. 1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The facts were uncertain. It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced. If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period. 2)Inexcusable delay was not established. 3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice. If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction. No evidence had been lost. The basement was available for inspection. It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants. 4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments. The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice. It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff. It appeared that the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendment was not apparent at the time the original claim was issued and arose out of the same occurrence. 4)Costs in the cause."

The defendant defaulted on the first payment and the issue was whether the Agreement was a lease or a security agreement. The plaintiff argued that it was a conditional sales agreement and that the right of the defendant to repossession and sale was restricted to sale under s. 46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The Court held that the Agreement is a lease and that liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two. The Court awarded judgment against the defendant in the amount of $7,679.33.  1)The Trade-in was valued at $10,000. The value of the trade-in did not equal the amount agreed to by the parties.  2)The Court awarded costs of the action in excess of $5,000 to the defendant.  3)The balance of the payments was due at the date of the termination of the Agreement.  4)There was no evidence as to the useful life or capital cost nor the capital cost, nor the cost of investment, nor whether there was depreciation or appreciation of value of investment.  5)The plaintiff was awarded costs in the sum of $1, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.  6)The amount of the interest was 5% and 7% respectively.  7)The defendant was awarded the amount due on the termination date.  8)A portion of the proceeds of sale were awarded to the plaintiff. 9)The court awarded the balance of interest at the rate of 5% per annum.  10% was added to the termination value and the balance was left over for future use of the equipment.  9)No costs were awarded for the breach of contract.","The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3."

The action was defended on the basis that the defendant was not ordinarily resident in Minnesota and, though served with notice of the action, did not appear before the Minnesota court or in any way submit to its jurisdiction. In Saskatchewan the law governing the enforcement of foreign judgments in this jurisdiction is set out in The Foreign Judgments Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The English Act is held to mean residence in the course of the person concerned, and is contrasted with special or occasional or casual residence. 2)The expression 'ordinarily resident' carries a restricted and specialized meaning. It is quite impossible to give it a precise and inclusive definition. It has many shades of meaning which vary in different matters. In one case it is satisfied by certain elements of the case, in another by others, it is restricted to certain common, or some new, meaning. 3)The court was not persuaded that subsections 3(b) or (c) had application in this matter. Only subsection (a) raised the question whether the defendant, at the time the action in Minnesota was commenced, was ordinarily resident there. 4)The defendant voluntarily appeared as a defendant in the action without protest and expressly or impliedly agreed to submit to jurisdiction.","The defendant manufactured solarium in Saskatoon which it sold to the plaintiffs in Minnesota. The plaintiffs alleged the solarium was defective, sued and obtained judgment in the Minnesota Court which it now sought to enforce in Saskatchewan. The defendant argued the Minnesota court did not have jurisdiction because at the time the action was commenced he was not 'ordinarily resident' in the state of Minnesota. The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the claim but did not appear or defend the action or surrender to its jurisdiction. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The defences available to defendant in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce foreign judgment are set out in s.6 of the Foreign Judgments Act. 2)While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion the defendant was ordinarily resident there. The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address. It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state. The Foreign Judgments Act reflects real difference in the meaning of 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'."

HELD: The accused was found guilty of all three charges. 1)The Crown met the necessary burden of proof with respect to the issue of identity. The Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's driving was impaired by alcohol having regard to the test in R. v. Stellato. There has not been a breach of fundamental justice. 2)The Certificate of Analysis was not sufficient to prove the time of the accident. The Court was unable to rely upon the Certificate as a reliable indicator of impairment. 3)There was no evidence as to the speed at which the accused was driving. The posted speed was 80 km/hr. There were two lanes on the north side of the intersection: two left hand turning lanes, two straight through lanes and one right turning lane. It was a controlled intersection. Advance yellow warning lights indicated to the Sunfire's driver that she would have to stop at the intersection and she slowed as she approached it. There was no vehicle stopped in front of the vehicle. The driver said that as the light was still red she turned her attention to her radio, adjusting the dial. She saw a taxi cab approach on her right, heading west toward the University and saw it slow down for a left turn south on Circle. She looked in her rear view mirror and saw head lights coming very quickly directly behind her and then her vehicle was hit. The only occupant in the cab was the driver. The face was blurry. She was only able to say that he had dark hair and wore a dark jacket. She would not have been able to identify the driver if it had not been for his passenger window being rolled up. He was the only person in the vehicle that she saw looking out at her through his window and then pulling away moving south bound on Circle Dr.  4)The Accused was acquitted of the charge of impaired driving. A conviction was entered for counts 2 and 3; driving while impaired and driving when disqualified.  5)The Court was not satisfied that there was a breach in fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with civilian witnesses during the trial.","Accused charged with impaired driving, being over.08 and driving while disqualified. The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases. Here the right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence as the Court was able to assess the weight to be given to the officers' evidence. The Charter application for a stay of proceedings alleging a breach of fundamental justice is denied."

The accused was charged with four offences with respect to a twelve year old girl. The offences included sexual assault under s. 271(1)(a), uttering a threat, s. 264.1(1.a), sexual touching under S. 151 and unlawfully having a weapon contrary to S. 87. The paraplegic had suffered serious injuries in an automobile accident in 1990 and was dependent on social assistance for his subsistence. He had not been gainfully employed since that time and had been living in various locations, including Halifax, Lower Sackville, Annapolis Royal, and B.C., where he lived with his father and a neighbour. He eventually moved to British Columbia, where he continued to reside until February, 2000, when he asked the local Social Services officer to provide him with funds to enable him to relocate to BC. He did not appear for trial on these charges and a wide warrant for his arrest was issued. He was eventually located in BC and returned to Halifax where he was arrested. The court was asked if he had any outstanding court dates and the accused replied that there was 'one court issue that was being dealt with and wouldn't prevent him from leaving the province'. No further inquiry was conducted and the money was made and the order for forfeiture was made. HELD: The court held that in the circumstances of this case, in view of the paraplegislative disability and the fact that the accused had not appeared at his trial date, a forfeiture order should not be ordered against the accused or surety or both. 1)The court reviewed the evidence and found that the evidence showed that although the accused was not present at the original trial dates, he had requested that the trial date be rescheduled because he had been injured and was unable to attend because both legs had been broken. 2)The accused was found to be in possession of $1,000. The money was found in the possession of the Crown and was ordered to be forfeited to the Crown.  3)A forfeiture order was not warranted as the court was not satisfied that the money would be used to satisfy the accused's need to travel to BC to attend his trial.  4)It was","The accused was charged with four offences relating to a twelve year old girl, including sexual assault and uttering a threat. He was released on bail with a surety. The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence."

The MPA does not apply to the appellant because they do not come within the definition in s2(g): 'Spouse' means either of man and woman who are married to each other, are married by marriage that is voidable and has not been annulled by a declaration of nullity, or have gone through a form of marriage with each other in good faith, which is void and are cohabiting or have cohabitated within the preceding year'. The definition of spouse in the Family Maintenance Act includes a widow or widower. HELD: Appeal allowed. Equal division of assets ordered. 1)The Act is of no force or effect. 2)Section 15(1) of The Charter provides that every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination. There is no discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age, disability, or any other factor. With respect to her claim for a division of respondent's assets, the appellant deposed that she was advised by her solicitor that the Act would require the defendant to establish that the appellant was not entitled to equal division and that such a requirement would result in a denial of her claim against the defendant for alia matrimonial property.  3)The respondent was awarded costs of the application against the appellant in any event of the cause.","The appellant and respondent lived together in common law relationship for approximately ten years. Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets. They separated in 1995. The appellant brought an application under s. 275 of the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of assets. She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship. The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect. This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter."

The vehicle was found with 28.3 pounds of marijuana in the trunk. The registered owner of the vehicle and the driver were both charged with trafficking in marihuana and possession of marijuana for the purposes of trafficking. The driver was found guilty on both counts; the passenger was found not guilty on the trafficking charge and the other charge was judicially stayed. The passenger applied to have her interest in the vehicle declared not affected by any forfeiture order. HELD: The Court held that the vehicle was within the definition of 'offence-related property' as defined in s. 2 of the Act and that it was used in any manner in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence or intended for use for the purpose of committing one. The Court ordered that the property be forfeited to the Queen's Bench in accordance with s. 19(3) and that any part of it returned to the owner was part of any order for forfeiture made under sub-section 16-16(1)(1) or 17-17(2).  1)The Court found that the Lincoln was used by the driver to transport drugs to and from the province of Saskatchewan and that the owner had a valid interest in it.  2)The vehicle was used to transport drug proceeds within and outside of Saskatchewan. The Lincoln was not used to commit a drug offence. It was not intended to be part of a drug trafficking offence. 3)The Act does not provide that a person who was charged with a drug related offence, or (a) acquired title to or acquired a right of possession of the property from a person referred to in paragraph 2(b), would be subject to a forfeiture order pursuant to section 16(2)(a) if the person appears innocent of any complicity in relation to an offence referred to paragraph 1(a) or (b) or any conspiracy to commit such an offence.  4)There was no evidence of collusion between the driver and the registered owner. The Crown did not prove that the driver consented to the operation of the Lincoln. The car was not being used for the commission or commission of any drug offence within the meaning of s. 5)The car was found to be in the possession of drug proceeds of trafficking within Saskatchewan.  6)A forfeiture order was made pursuant to sub-s16(2) of","The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment."

The order went on to provide for access by the municipality to ensure compliance and to recover the cost of any removal or destruction of any portion of the premises that remained in breach of the consent order.

The petitioner worked full time for the Government of Saskatchewan and took university classes. She used child care services in her home and in 1999 spent $5,357.80 on child care. She produced child care receipts for 2000 of $2,790 plus $1,100 which was said to be owed to a family member. HELD: 1) The respondent was to pay $774 per month as basic child support plus $226 per month for proportionate share of child care costs. For purposes of calculating child support, the income of the respondent was set at $59,800. Under the terms of the judgment the petitioner had custody of their two children, aged 12 and 7. The respondent's father died in 1999, before the pre-trial conference and he had not received any gifts since that time and said his mother is not able to afford to help in the same way as his father did. His 1999 tax return indicated an income of $42,386.34 and he worked all day Saturday in the family business but said there were no suitable babysitters in the area so he could not secure child care while he was at work on Saturdays. 2) The petitioner's 1999 child care expenditures were in excess of $4,000 and the petitioner would have about $4k in child care expense this year. 3) Access was to be varied to alternate weekends, to be extended to Monday evening in the event of a long weekend and the respondent's access to the children on alternate weekends to be increased to every other weekend.  4) Child support was reduced to $750 per month based upon the petitioner's evidence that the respondent agreed to child support of $1k not based upon his reported income but rather to reflect his true income including cash and unreported income. It was clear from his 1998 tax return that his income was $43,209 and that his prior tax returns never showed income of any near $59k and evidence also indicated a lifestyle spending during the marriage which was inconsistent with his income. 5) There was no evidence as to his 1999 income and his 2000 tax return suggests his income in 2000 will be $44k. 6) Permitting the petitioner to keep the respondent informed of her expenses for child care was not an issue as she was able to provide for the children's care expenses in the amount of $3,000.","The mother had custody of the 12 and year olds under the terms of the January 10, 2000 consent judgment. The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children."

The defendant placed in issue whether it is liable for the injuries she sustained in this slip and fall accident; and(b) the degree of personal injury sustained as a result of the accident. HELD: 1) The fall was caused in part by the fact that the plaintiff was wearing worn running shoes without laces. The plaintiff acknowledged that there were no laces in her running shoes, but denied that they were badly worn or that they contributed in any way to her fall. 2) The most significant injury sustained by the plaintiff related to a sprain of her left ankle, for which the physiotherapist recommended certain exercises. Her family doctor prescribed more potent painkillers and recommended physiotherapy. On April 7, 2000 the plaintiff received the first of five physiotherapy treatments over a five week period at Regina Sports and Physiotherapy Clinic. She asserted that she did not receive more treatments due to the fact the only five treatments were covered by Saskatchewan Health Plan and she could not afford to take additional treatments which may have helped her recovery. Her affidavit asserts that she decided doctors could not help her and she ""tried to get better on her own"". During cross-examination, the plaintiff explained that she had chosen to rely upon her faith in the Lord for healing her injuries. Certain assertions in the plaintiff's affidavit relating to her injuries and treatment were inconsistent with the physician notes and medical reports filed in evidence and with information elicited during cross- examination. Those inconsistencies were not relevant to this decision. 3) The plaintiff's claim followed the simplified procedure in Part Forty of The Queen's Bench Rules. It established that a regular cleaning regimen had been implemented in the store. Specifically, employees in the produce department were responsible to sweep or mop floors in the aisle at least once per hour. A'sweep log' was kept for each department and entries of cleaning activities were made and initiated by employees. This included regular inspections of the floor in every department to ensure that all hazards such as spills and obstructions were free of hazards and adhered to the procedures followed by the employees, including the General Services Department employees who were not attached to any particular department.  4) The defendant estimated the time of the fall at approximately 4:00 p.m. Affidavit evidence filed on behalf of the defendant acknowledged there was a small amount of water on the floor near where the plaintiff fell. 5","The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances."

He appeals his conviction and sentence. The grounds of appeal are as follows: 1) the evidence does not support a guilty verdict for dangerous driving; 2) the learned trial judge misinterpreted the law with respect to the required elements that must be proven when considering a charge of 'dangerous driving.' 3) the trial judge erred when he applied the test of R. v. Stellato to the'marked departure' consideration that the Supreme Court of Canada in R.v. Hundal held to be the prevailing test when determining whether driving can be termed dangerous. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge was correct to say that the standard to be applied is whether the driving is a departure from the norm and that the law properly describes it as dangerous driving. 2) The law doesn't require any longer than Mr. Matchee's departure be a marked departure, but in the circumstances, pursuing the vehicle as he did, close at whatever speed he was driving, he managed to run into the back of another vehicle. It amounts to a lapse in attention for such a lapse of care as would be required under provincial legislation, and shades over the line, albeit perhaps not far enough, that one ought to, and properly characterize driving as dangerous. In those circumstances, and in those circumstances he was found guilty as charged, it is on his version of events, and not the full Crown description, with multiple rammings and so forth, that it is proper to have said, 'the law is clear, as it should be.'  3) It was incorrect for the learned judge to say, 'in all of these circumstances, must ask myself whether applying the test in Stellado, Mr.Matchee’s driving was a departure of the norm, and at the end of the day, think it was.'  4) The proper standard for determining whether a charge is dangerous is whether there must be a such marked departure from a standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the accused's situation. There must be such a departure that it can be said beyond reasonable doubt that the driving was dangerous. 5) There was no evidence that the accused was driving in a manner that was dangerous to the public, having regard","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving (Criminal Code s.249(1)(a)) and sentence of a $1,200 fine, $180 surcharge, and 18 month driving prohibition. In issue was whether the evidence found by the trial judge established both the mens rea and actus reus beyond a reasonable doubt. The sentence appeal was brought on the ground it did not take into account mitigating circumstances, case law or sentencing principles. HELD: The appeal against conviction was dismissed. The driving prohibition was reduced to 9 months. The fine and surcharge were confirmed. 1)By applying the wrong standard, the trial judge committed an error of law, but no miscarriage of justice occurred. When the correct standard, as enunciated in Hundal, is applied to the evidence as found by the trial judge, the conviction was appropriate. 2)The application of the Stellato principle to a charge of dangerous driving under s.249(1) was an error in law. The conclusion that the Crown need only establish proof of any degree of impairment and not a marked departure from normal behaviour does not apply to a charge under s.249. Simple judgmental errors in routine driving do not constitute conduct amounting to a marked departure from the standard of care required. Mere negligence or driving without due care and attention are not sufficient. 3)The accused's evidence did not address how fast he was going (he stated his speedometer was not working) nor over what route or the time of the chase. There was ample evidence on those issues from the two Crown witnesses. 4)The findings of fact established the appellant's driving conduct did amount to a marked departure from the standard of care a reasonable person would exercise in those circumstances. The test is whether a reasonably prudent driver in the circumstances ought to have been aware of the risk and of the danger involved in his driving conduct. The accused engaged in a planned and deliberate course of conduct when he gave chase and continued over a significant distance at a high speed at night with children and other pedestrians in the vicinity. It was not necessary for the Crown to establish the collision caused significant damage or that a collision occurred at all. The acceptance of the accused's assertion that the collision was inadvertent did not mean the Crown failed to prove the necessary mens rea. 5)An 18 month prohibition was excessive. The conduct was at the low end of the continuum. He was employed as a truck driver and relied on his operator's licence to earn a living. He chased the other vehicle because he believed its occupants stole tapes from his vehicle. Although he was convicted for refusal to provide breath samples 2 years ago, alcohol was not a factor here."

The applicant had operated a private pool hall licensed to sell alcoholic beverages since 1995. The area where the pool hall was located was subject to the respondent's land use by-laws. In July 2000, the respondent amended its by-law to permit only the use of certain uses in the 'Core Village', which included bed and breakfasts, full-service restaurants, limited service eating places, and special food services.

The court found that the applicant had not proven that the proposed license was not in compliance with the bylaw.

The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation. The Municipality refused to issue a letter to the effect that the premises were properly zoned for that purpose, arguing that the proposal would result in a change in use requiring a development agreement. The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use. Application granted; the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change. There was no evidence that the proposal would result in a nuisance or increased traffic, neither of which could be presumed."
132,Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,The appellant was charged with driving while his ability was impaired by alcohol or drug and for refusing the breathalyzer. The trial judge dismissed the refusal count as the officer had failed in his testimony to give evidence of the words used in the 'Breathalyzer demand'. That decision is not under appeal. The learned trial judge then heard the evidence of both the Crown and the defence with respect to the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge erred in taking into consideration the result of the SL-2 test and agreed with counsel and for the purposes of this decision that it was unnecessary to detail the reasons for the decision. The appellant had consumed only two beers prior to the offence. It was concluded that the appellant's truck struck the parked vehicle because it was inattentive and not paying attention to the traffic in front of him. The failure of the test to detect if the appellant was impaired beyond a reasonable doubt was also a factor in the decision to acquit the appellant.  1) The court accepted the Crown's evidence that the driver had been drinking and driving within the meaning of s. 24(2) of the Motor Vehicle Offences Act. 2) The appellant was acquitted of both charges.,"The police observed the appellant's vehicle rub another vehicle and followed him to where he parked without difficulty. While taking the appellant to where the incident occurred, the officer noted slight smell of alcohol and bloodshot eyes. The appellant failed the ALERT test and refused the breathalyzer. The refusal charge was dismissed and the appellant was convicted of impaired driving. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The evidence of impairment was too weak to convict the appellant. The officer told the accused that if he passed the ALERT test, he would be sent on his way. Thus, she must not have thought that the appellant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired. Failure to act cannot be considered by the trial judge as part of the reasonable and probable grounds."

There were four separate incidents involving the accused's dog in September 2001. The first occurred when the complainant reported that her dog frightened her dog as she walked down an alley towards her house. There was another incident when the dog ran through the complainant's yard and upset her daughter. HELD: The Court found that on all four dates there was no intrusion which was sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered as provocation, even if the Crown had not conceded the point of view that the dog's barks, snarls and growls were not necessary for there to be an attack. An attack is an unrequested confrontation of a human by a dog made in circumstances where the dog exhibits loud and angry-sounding barks or growls, and is made within close range of the human. Common sense and don't have any law provided to the contrary of what consider to be common sense. A bite is not necessary. In that sense the definition of battle is not apt in that in that you intend to come into physical proximity, but not engage in aggressive and physical contact with the opposing party. The offence may not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but the evidence in this case was conclusive. The Court sentenced the accused to nine months imprisonment, to be served in a federal penitentiary, and ordered a fine of $1,000.00 to be paid within 30 days from the date of his release.  1)The Court accepted the Crown's submission that the accused took such reasonable steps as were necessary to prevent the offence from occurring.  2)The Crown accepted that the presumption of non-provocation in s.135.2(1) applies and that that presumption has not been displaced. The definition of 'attack' in the dictionary is not appropriate nor accurate in the context of an attack by an animal. Dogs do not go into battle, not in the ordinary sense of that word, and consider the ordinary meaning to be a voluntary intention to be involved in some physically violent act. 3)The accused took reasonable steps to protect himself and his family from the dog on three of the four occasions.  4)The dog barked and growled at the complainant on the first two occasions. The dog then ran up to her house and barked at her as she came out of her house on the third occasion.","The accused was charged with owning a dog that without provocation attacked a person contrary to the Urban Municipality Act s.135.3(3). There were four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001. At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on any of the four occasions. The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced. HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions. The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post. There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled. The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty. 2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3). It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands. The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed. logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog. One would not expect dog to be attached to logging chain if there were no concerns."

The Receiver and Trustee in Bankruptcy applied for a vesting order with respect to a sale of property held by the Registered Owner. The applicant raised with counsel for the applicant the court's jurisdiction to issue the order. Neither the applicant nor the applicant trustee proceeded with foreclosure proceedings against the property. HELD: The court was satisfied that the mortgagee's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price of the property and that there were no other interests that would be adversely affected if the order was granted. The only question remaining is whether or not the discretion to grant the order should appropriately be applied in the circumstances of this case. The court concluded that s. 109 of the new Land Titles Act combined with ss. 12 and 65 of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 were not sufficient authority to support granting the order but that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Title Conversion Facilitation Regulations did serve the purpose and intent of the former provisions contained in s. 87. Because of the conclusions reached based upon the materials filed and the affidavit of the representative of the trustee in bankruptcy, the court concluded there was no adverse interest in the registered owner nor any subsequent encumbrancers, competing creditors or rights respecting redemption or preservation of equity.","FIAT. The receiver manager of the registered owner (the numbered company) under the Bankruptcy Act and the instrument appointed receiver on behalf of the secured creditor and mortgagee (HSBC Bank) applied for a vesting order. The trustee had tried to sell the real property for year. HELD: The vesting order was granted. 1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so. In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87. 2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor. The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price. The registered owner had taken no opposition. No other interests will be adversely affected. 3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment."
136,Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,"This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The applicant was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer limit and impaired driving contrary to Criminal Code s.253(b). He was arraigned on the information on November 12, 2002 and entered a not guilty plea. He requested the first available date for trial, December 18, 2003. It was anticipated that one full day would be required as the defence intended to make a Charter motion and lead 'evidence to the contrary'. Allowing the stay and ordering a new trial, that the time between the swearing of the information and the commencement of trial is a period of 14 months. There is a real concern that failure of the justice system to deal fairly, quickly and efficiently with criminal trials inevitably leads to frustration with the judicial system and eventually to a feeling of contempt for court procedures. When certain certain crimes are committed and certain witnesses are available and available, it is far more certain that the guilty party will be convicted.","The defendant applied for a stay of proceedings on the basis of a violation of his right to be tried in a reasonable time. There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial. Stay of proceedings granted. At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered."

HELD: The application was dismissed. While a chambers judge may not have the independent authority to make a maintenance order, a Queen's Bench chambers judge has the authority to stay a chambers judgment in its entirety in certain cases. The fact that we are dealing with a relatively short period of time cannot be determinative of whether maintenance should be payable particularly in light of the fact that the order is stayed, which leaves the decision to be left to the trial judge.","This was an application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules.

HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed. The length of delay from release on an undertaking to the date of trial is approximately fifteen months. The Crown anticipated calling three witnesses. This is not a complicated case. The delay is sufficient to warrant an inquiry into the reasons for the delay. The onus is on the Crown to prove the breach on the balance of probabilities. In R. v. Morin, the Supreme Court of Canada proposed a delay of eight to ten months in Provincial Court would be acceptable. In this case, the total delay is attributable to the accused remaining in the country for approximately two and one-half years. The accused requested the adjournment from July 31, 2003 to October 6, 2003. The Information was adjourned at the request of the accused until October 6 due to the lack of Legal Aid resources to conduct an earlier interview. October 6 was then adjourned and a new trial date was set for October 7, 2004. A not guilty plea was entered and a trial date set for May 6, 2004 on application by the Crown. The non-attendance of the complainant is relevant. The complainant was charged with assault, threatening to use a weapon, using a knife and mischief by wilfully destroying a lamp of value over $5,000 contrary to s. 430(4) of the Criminal Code. The date of his first appearance in court was set at July 31/04. The trial date of May 6/04 was also adjourned due to a delay in bringing the matter before the Court of Appeal Division. There is no evidence as to why the delay was so long.  1)The delay in this case is not the result of inherent time requirements. 2)The accused is entitled to a fair trial on a charge of assault under s. 266(a) and s. 267(a). 3)The right to a speedy trial as guaranteed by s. 11(b) of The Charter is not infringed.  4)Prejudice against the accused is a factor to be taken into account.","The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time.

HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed. 1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months. This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry. 2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children. There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this. 3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking. As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused. 3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence."

The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court accepted the evidence of the RCMP officer who observed the accused driving erratically and failed the horizontal gaze nystagmus, the Romberg and the heel and toe test and noted the accused's vehicle made an abrupt lane change twice without signalling and wandered within the lane but did not cross into the adjacent one. The officer was not qualified in the field sobriety tests nor was there any expert testimony on the proper method, interpretation, and reliability of the tests. The accused failed six out of six of the clues. Failing four of six indicates a seventy-seven percent possibility of the presence of blood alcohol concentration of one hundred milligrams or more.  1) The officer had learned the procedure at a training course in February 2002 and had only used it three times since then. He had no expert opinion as to the validity of the method or the accuracy of the results of the various tests.  2) The court found the accused was not in breach of any of the implied rights of counsel when he made a demand and demand for a breath sample. He indicated that he had consumed one beer with his lunch, but the officer noted that the accused had only consumed one half-full bottle of beer. There was no evidence of any other beverage alcohol in the accused of consuming prior to driving. 3) The accused's right to counsel was not infringed by the failure of the accused to provide evidence of impairment. The evidence was found to be inadmissible.  4) There was insufficient evidence to prove the accused impaired driving by more than 90 per cent of the time.  5) The trial judge found that the evidence did not support the conclusion of impairment by blood alcohol content in excess of.08.  6) The evidence established that the officer had observed the driver make two abrupt lane changes within two minutes of responding to the emergency lights and that his vehicle had been travelling at approximately 120 km/hr over the speed limit. 7) The police officer did not observe any other signs of impairment, such as slurred speech, slurred eyes, glazed or bloodshot or glazed, but no problems with balance, and was cooperative and alert.  8) The Court found that there was sufficient evidence to conclude that the","The accused youth is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions. However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face."

The grounds of appeal are as follows: the Tribunal erred in law in ruling that the complainant made his complaint within the Code's limitation period; in finding that the City was not prejudiced by the considerable time that has elapsed since many of the events raised since this complaint took place; in deciding the City is responsible for harassment against the complainant, factoring that finding into the overall decision on liability and remedy for discrimination; the Tribunal improperly imparted to the City a burden akin to vicarious liability or a fiduciary duty regarding the alleged acts of harassment which either were unknown to the supervisors of the complainant or were events in which such supervisors acted appropriately in the circumstances; in its application of the law on the duty to accommodate in ruling the City should also have accommodated the complainant retroactively when the City took steps in 1996 to remedy the situation of others passing Kivela by in acquiring seniority. HELD: The City and CUPE take issue with the Tribunal's findings and take certain findings with respect to the Code, by finding the City had failed to reasonably accommodate him and in finding the resignation was result of discriminatory treatment and not a result of his complaint being within the limitation period and in failing to find the City accommodated him adequately, reasonably, and to the point of undue hardship. 1) The Court found that the Tribunal applied the wrong test in its finding the city was not guilty of discrimination because the complainant's complaint was within the limitations of the Code and the Tribunal did not apply the correct test. 2) The City is not guilty because the Code does not give the Tribunal a vicarious duty. The Tribunal's interpretation of the concept of 'undue hardship' as it is defined in paragraph 2(1)(q) is wrong. It is wrong to say the actus reus of discrimination is the same as that of discrimination in the common law. 3) The Code is not applicable to this case because the circumstances were different than those in which the Code was intended to apply. The Code was not intended to create a duty on the City to accommodate the complainant. The duty is different than that imposed on the Commission. The Commission is not bound by the Code to accommodate a person who is subject to discrimination. The","This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal."

HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of aggravated assault. The Court believed the testimony of the complainant's 16 year old daughter who had been injured in the assault. She had no memory of the events and ended up in the hospital after being struck in the face and suffered a cut tongue, swollen face and a broken nose. The court accepted the evidence of the accused's friend who had witnessed the fight between the accused and the complainant. The accused was found not guilty of the charge of dangerous driving because the accused had not shown any intent to operate a motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and s. 267(b) because he did not have a driver's license and had consumed approximately the same amount of alcohol as the complainant, who was the driver of the vehicle at the time of the incident. It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused struck the complainant in the head with the steering wheel or that he struck her in the neck with the wheel. The Crown did not prove that the complainant fell or was knocked unconscious as a result of the blows to the head or that she suffered any injuries to the neck, face or body that would justify an action under s. 268(b). The Court concluded that the evidence did not support the conclusion that either the complainant or the friend was the aggressor in the fight. The complainant's testimony was not accepted by the Court as it was not corroboration.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code; assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Code; dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Code; and two counts of assault contrary to s. 266(a) of the Code. HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict. 2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant. The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered. The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct. The offence of dangerous driving was established and the accused was found guilty. 4) The accused was found guilty of two counts of assault."

He sought a termination of spousal support or alternatively a decrease in support with a fixed date for termination. The parties were married in 1984 and separated in 1996 after 12 years of marriage. Their 16 year old son has been living with his father since October 1996 except for a year when he lived with his uncle. At the time of the divorce in 1998, the petitioner's income was approximately $51,000 and the respondent's income from CPP disability payments was $7,584. Throughout the marriage, the respondent suffered from serious mental illness. The petitioner retired from the military in 2004 after 25 years of service. He refused postings outside the province. The postings offered were Gagetown with the possibility of deployment to Afghanistan, and Edmonton with a potential deployment to Bosnia. His evidence was that his family life came first. His partner was in mid-career as a nurse in Nova Scotia. She had a child as well to consider. The mother has never been asked or ordered to pay child support. HELD: The application was dismissed. There was no change in the condition, means, or other circumstances of either spouse. Neither spouse has occurred since the application was made.","The husband applied to vary a corollary relief judgment in order to either terminate spousal support or decrease it with a fixed date for termination.

The complainant was employed as a clerk at the Provincial Court Building. Although she testified that she knew of the accused in 1999, it is more likely that she met him in the spring of 2002 after he had assumed his duties as Justice of the Peace in the same building. There was a 'family atmosphere' in the building presumably because everyone knew one another. The accused was aware that the complainant had been a member of the R.C.M.P. at one time. Jokes and teasing frequently took place between the men and women, both verbal and written, frequently having sexual connotations to them and some were explicitly sexual in nature. Some persons made point of making numerous copies of the jokes for the purpose of distribution. Personal information was also exchanged amongst the staff members. HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty as charged. The Court believed the complainant's testimony that she was intimidated by the accused, that he was wearing a robe and felt like he had to sit and listen to what she said because she was so upset by the comments, and that she had to keep telling herself to 'keep on going to work, put up with the crap and just try to keep a friendly atmosphere at work'. The Court concluded that the Court did not believe the accused's version that the comments were made as a joke and that he did not intend to offend the complainant.","The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her."

It is a well established principle in Canadian law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is inadmissible on a trial on the balance of probabilities.

The statements were not made in a fit of anger or frustration, but in a state of fear and duress. They were made under duress and with the intent to frighten or intimidate. The words spoken by the deceased to her friends and family do not amount to anything more than a declaration of fact.

The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath."

He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. the next morning. The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service. The City of Saskatoon is their employer. The position of the defendants is that the plaintiff was lawfully arrested for obstruction, and that the cut he received was a by-product of his resistance during arrest and did not involve any more force than was reasonably necessary. HELD: The plaintiff was found not guilty of both charges. 1) The evidence referred to in the following emerges from such affidavits together with the cross-examination that was conducted on each affidavit. The events leading up to the arrest and the activity of all participants while in the lounge are not in dispute. 2) The actions of the plaintiff outside of the lounge is in dispute as is whether his actions amount to obstruction. 3) It was necessary to arrest the plaintiff bearing in mind the provisions of s. 495(2) of the Criminal Code of Canada. 4) The plaintiff's actions amounted to obstruction and the arrest was lawful. 5) There was no evidence that the defendant assaulted the plaintiff. 6) Compensatory damages and exemplary damages were awarded.","The plaintiff seeks damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received cut to his scalp. He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning. The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service. The City of Saskatoon is their employer. HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle. The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount. It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements. 1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge. The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty. The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully. The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty. 2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help. Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa. Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty. There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty. 3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions. The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty. The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. 4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention. The plaintiff experienced headaches for several weeks. He also had stiff neck and sleep disturbance. There were no long term effects. Corrigendum received January 25, 2005 and added to fulltext."

Thereafter, the plaintiff brought a motion to the Court seeking an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items. The defendants filed a statement of defence in March 2005 denying that Peak had any obligation to redeem the plaintiff's preferred shares, as asked for by the plaintiff in paragraph 38 of the Statement of Claim, or that the Beveridges had any obligations to the plaintiff with respect to the payment of dividends or redemption of shares. In July 2005, the Court directed that the solicitor would be allowed to cross-examine the defendant on his affidavit and that the defendant was to bring with him all financial information and documentation, including income tax returns and assessments for Peak and Ascent Financial Services Ltd. This cross-examination proceeded and the matter was brought back before the Court with an amended notice of motion seeking the original relief plus additional relief, including an order pursuant to Rule 129 and Rule 133 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court, for an order granting the plaintiff, Margaret Fehr, summary judgment against the defendant, Peak Enterprises Inc. as follows: (a) judgment in the amount of $214,600 plus interest at rate of 16% per annum from March 6, 2005 to the date of judgment; (b) an order removing the affidavit of the defendant sworn July 15, 2005 in its entirety from the action; (c) an amendment to their statement of Defence allowing them to plead that Peak was prohibited from redeeming preferred shares under s. 34(2) of The Business Corporations Act; and (d) the inherent jurisdiction of the Court striking the statement of defense of all the defendants. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs in any event of the cause. 1) The plaintiff could not simply simply change the wording of the wording in support of her application simply because the defendant could not provide any additional information. The plaintiff asserted a number of grounds as the basis for making such an order. 2) There was no evidence presented by the defendants as to the failure of the plaintiff to provide any purported financial information for any of the purported undertakings provided by the defendant. The defendant's failure to comply with any undertakings did not comply with the Court's fiat and that he has failed to comply by fiat with the court's order that he produce the documents that he was ordered to produce by the Court.  3) The defendants were ordered to provide within 7 days an accounting","There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs."
148,Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Issue | Reason | Conclusion | Non_IRC Document : ,"The plaintiff was a security officer for a mall store when he was struck by a van while pursuing a shoplifter. The van was being used as a getaway vehicle in the shoplifting heist and was being driven by a second individual. The plaintiff suffered serious injuries to his knee. He sued the driver of the van, the owner of the vehicle and the second individual, claiming damages for injuries suffered as a result of the accident. He also brought an action against his insurer, ING Halifax, under his Section (uninsured motorist) coverage. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada joined the proceeding as a third party under the provisions of s. 133(14) of the Insurance Act whereby it is defending the action against its insured under reservation of rights. The defendants were absent from this trial and counsel have not been able to locate either of them. Prior to trial, counsel for the plaintiff and Allstate reached an agreement on the quantum of damages to be paid to the plaintiff which shortened the trial considerably. What remains to be decided is whether that sum should be paid by Allstate or ING. The facts in this case are very much in dispute which necessitates a number of credibility findings to be made. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $162,500 plus costs.  1) There was no evidence of the identity of the driver who was driving the vehicle that struck the plaintiff. The only evidence was that the driver was in the mall when the incident occurred and that he was driving that vehicle at the time of the incident. 2) The plaintiff's claim against the insurer was dismissed as there was insufficient evidence to prove the insurer's breach of contract.","The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter. The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages. The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed. The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle."

His sole ground of appeal hinges on the Court accepting fresh evidence. The central issue at trial was whether the drugs found at the premises being rented by one Sandra Bodkin belonged to the accused or to her. The trial judge determined that the drugs and drug paraphernalia seized belonged to Bodkin and that the accused was not living in the basement. The accused moved into the open portion of the basement based on Bodkin's evidence. She testified that she would pay the accused cash or give him jewelry as collateral. She claimed that she purchased drugs from the accused almost every day. When the police arrived at the duplex they determined that Bodkin was sober, even though she was concerned about some stoned concerns about the accused. She gave police permission to search the basement portion, which she claimed was being used by the accused, and 23.4 grams of crystal meth were discovered. Several items were seized, including a machete, a second knife in a case, a dagger, scale, baggies, a jewelry box and a ring. Bodkin testified that all of these items were hers, with the exception of the ring which she said she gave the accused as collateral for drug purchases. The Crown appealed the conviction. HELD: The appeal against conviction was dismissed with costs. 1)On the issue of credibility, if believe the evidence of the accused must acquit him of the charges, the Court must be cautious about accepting her testimony. Without her evidence, the Crown's case must fail. Given the fact that she was a heavy user of drugs at the time of the offence, the trial judge had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt. 2)The Court was not convinced that the Crown had proven beyond a doubt the accused's involvement in the trafficking of drugs or that the items seized were the possession or the proceeds of crime. The Court was satisfied beyond doubt that the evidence was consistent with the accused being the dealer and purchaser of the drugs. 3)The accused was acquitted on all three counts.","The appellant appealed his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the court accepting fresh evidence. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed. There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed. 1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission. 2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us. All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay. Any evidence sought to be adduced under the discretion of what is now s. 683 of the Code must be admissible evidence. With respect to the evidence of Ms. Brinkman, she does not swear that Ms. Bodkin was selling methamphetamine at the relevant time. 3) With respect to due diligence, it must be noted that the appellant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who represents him before this court. The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward. If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems. 4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered."

The flight was delayed for about an hour and a half at the Punta cana airport as a result of several evolving mechanical difficulties referred to by the pilot as a 'creeping delay' resulting in uncomfortable conditions on the airplane for the passengers. The plaintiff seeks to bring the class action for negligence for which he alleged all of the defendants are liable; unlawful confinement on the part of the pilot; breach of contract with regard to the defendant's contract of carriage of passengers and breach of the duty of care and fidelity to the class. HELD: The application for certification is dismissed.  1) The plaintiff has not proven that there was a palpable danger of bodily harm caused by the delay nor has there been an established causal relationship between the cause of the delay and the degree of bodily injury suffered by the plaintiffs.  2) There is no evidence to establish that the delay caused bodily injury beyond a reasonable doubt. The only evidence before the Court is that the plane was delayed by approximately one hour and one half due to mechanical difficulties with respect to the cabin pressure system. This is insufficient to establish a causal connection between the mechanical difficulties and the passengers' injuries. 3) There was no evidence as to the extent to which the delay contributed to the plaintiffs injuries. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to judgment against the defendants in any class action brought pursuant to s. 4(2)(b) of the Act.  5) The Court held that it would be inappropriate for the Court to direct the certification application to a certification hearing on the issue of the meaning of “bodily injury” within Article 17 of the Montreal Convention of 1999.  6) It is not necessary for the applicants to prove that the plaintiff suffered a bodily injury as defined in the definition of injury contained in s. 215 of the Charter. 7) The Act does not provide a mechanism for certification hearings to be held on the narrow issue of whether or not there was an injury suffered during the flight. 8) The applicants have failed to show that the plaintiffs were injured in any way beyond the definition set out in the Act or that the injuries were caused by acts of nature other than negligence. 9) The applicant has not shown that the defendants were negligent in any of the acts alleged.","The plaintiff applies for certification pursuant to The Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight from the Dominican Republic to Regina. The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties. The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action.

The petitioner mother has custody of the three children. The respondent father, before, during and after the relationship, is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running a mixed grain and cattle operation. They have not settled division of the matrimonial property. What amounts are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purposes of calculating child support payments? The individual items are (i) non-arm's length salaries; (ii) personal expenses claimed as farm expenses; (iii) capital cost allowance on real property owned by the father; (iv) capital Cost Allowances on personal property owned the father. (v) Personal expenses claimed in partnership returns are farm expenses. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last three years. The inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances of this operation to use a three-year average. In assessing each of the issues, will deal with them on a year-by-year basis. Although the general rationale will apply to all of these issues, the individual amounts will differ by year. 2) The mother wishes further to have the sum of $2,000 of horse expenses added back to the income. It has not been established that the value of the salary for 2003 was $15,000. It would appear that the amount paid in 2003 and the healthy income to the farmer otherwise in that year, was a means of splitting income, and as such, it was not appropriate to use that amount for child support in 2004. No claim was made for non arm's length salary in 2005. It is clear in 2003 the total amount claimed on the return for business expenses is $ 2,000 and appears to be appropriate. The father has expensed electricity, meals and office expenses of $4,675, some of which should be added back. In 2004 no amount was added back as the $5,000 appeared to be a reasonable amount. It appears that the more appropriate amount would be $10,000 utilized in 2004 in 2003. 3) There is evidence that the mother did perform services for the farming operation, mostly in the nature of bookkeeping, but no indication was provided as to whether the amount she was paid was reasonable. The evidence does not support this approach.","The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount."
152,Issue | Issue | Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason Document : ,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. The only evidence led in the voir dire at the trial was that of the police officer who had stopped the respondent in a routine traffic stop of vehicles entering Saskatoon from the east. After the police determined that he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe the respondent was operating his motor vehicle while impaired, he arrested the respondent, read the respondent his right to retain counsel and gave the requisite police warning. When the respondent arrived at the police station, the officer asked if he would like to use the phone room to speak with a lawyer once the room was available, and he said he would. The officer then dialled Legal Aid. Legal Aid was so busy that the officer hung up, re-tried, it was still busy, gave the phone to the accused, told him the line was busy and asked if once it was available if he'd like to speak to a lawyer, and that was at 12:32 a.m. He indicated he wanted to call Legal Aid and after that, after that would ask him, 'Do you know the name of the lawyer?' and he says 'No, don't have him in mind.' The accused's response was 'Yeah, Legal Aid.' HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The judge correctly interpreted the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Prosper (1994), 3 S.C.R. 236 in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. 2) The trial judge correctly applied the reasoning in Prosper to the circumstances in this case. 3) There was no error in the trial judge's analysis.","The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer."

Inc. (Sweeprite). The applications were brought pursuant to ss. 63 and 66 of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. HELD: The motion was dismissed. The court found that the lease was for three years and the lease term was not to begin until after the closing date of the agreement between Patchrite and Sweeprite. The lease provided for an annual rental of $24,000 and the first rental payment of $2,000 was made by Sweeprite to Patchrite in February 2003. It provided that the Equipment Lease's term would be extended to May 1, 2007 and that Patchrite never registered an interest at the personal property security registry as less than less than one-half of one percent of the value of the equipment. The equipment was used and continued to be used by the respondent in its manufacturing processes and was listed as Schedule 'A' to the equipment lease. It was the only written lease of personal property by any of the parties and was not subject to any extension or renewal agreement.  1) The court reviewed the history of the two companies and their dealings with each other and found that neither had commenced a business in the manufacture of street and parking lot sweepers. 2) It found that there was no evidence to indicate that the equipment was being used for the purpose of producing street sweepers in the manner contemplated in the PPSA. It concluded that the only material change in circumstances was the fact that the respondent was no longer a lessee of the original equipment. 3) There was nothing in the court could conclude from the Agreed statement as to the status of the respondent's interest in the land, building and equipment. 4) It was not satisfied that the terms of the lease were reasonable or that the interest of the bank in the equipment would be diminished by virtue of the extension.","The Bank presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent corporation respecting assets leased by the respondent to Sweeprite. By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease. This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business."

The respondent seeks this variation pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act and s. 10 of The Family Maintenance Act. In addition to variation of the amount of child support, the respondent asks that the variation order apply retroactively to July 1, 2003. He also seeks costs to be assessed on a solicitor/client basis. HELD: 1) The parties consented to the order of September 10, 1999. The primary residence of both children changed to be with the respondent. The petitioner was provided reasonable access only. 2) The respondent agreed to pay $250 per month as his share of Meghan's special/extraordinary costs. 3) The consent order of November 25, 1999 varied the earlier consent order when the respondent became unemployed and received employment insurance only. It was agreed that each of the parties each had equal incomes of $21,000 and that as a consequence of their equal sharing of parental care, neither would pay basic nor special child support to the other. 4) The petitioner's annual child support guidelines income was agreed to be $25,000. She was ordered to pay to pay child support for both children. The Court of Appeal remitted the issue back to the Court of Queen's Bench on November 16, 2001. 5) Should the consent order be varied? If there is no variation, for determination of how to specify the order for child support shall be specifically exercised, the transcript of the trial judge's oral reasons should be read. The reasons of the appeal panel were found in favour of the respondent and the order restored. 6) There is nothing in the Charter that precludes an application to vary a consent order made pursuant to Part II of The Children's Law Act, 1997. The parties agreed to a division of the Canada Child Tax Benefit and GST quarterly rebate, income credits (equivalent to spousal deduction) and the respondent accepted exclusive responsibility for Ryan's child care costs and other extraordinary expenses. The children resided an equal amount of time with each party. The agreement was not in dispute. 7) There was no evidence of an agreement between the parties as to the costs of child care expenses. 8) Costs should be determined on solicitor-client basis in accordance with s. 15(1)(a) and (b) of The Child Support Guidelines.","The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed."

The Agreement contained four separate call options for the purchase and delivery of South American Low Sulphur Coal in quarterly instalments of up to 100,000 tonnes. The Court granted summary judgment to NSPI for the amount of coal supplied in quarter 2 and refused to grant summary judgment for quarter 4. After discovery of the expert who was retained by AMCI to provide an opinion with respect to the commercial reasonableness of the purchase of substitute coal, the expert advised counsel for AMCI that he was unable to carry out the analysis due to insufficiency of materials provided by the plaintiff. AMCI is now seeking costs of this application. Damages have yet to be determined. This will require further hearing depending on the results of the appeal of the decision on summary judgment. For now, counsel have asked the court to decide costs pending the hearing of this appeal. Costs are in the discretion of the court.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant for failing to supply three of the four quarterly amounts of coal due pursuant to their contract. Following a two-day summary judgment application, the court granted judgment for one of the three quarters, with damages to be determined. Costs were at issue for the summary judgment application as well as a previous application brought by the defendant to compel document production. The defendant's application was resolved prior to being heard in Chambers, but only after discovery examination was held in New York. Costs awarded for the summary judgment application on the basis of $2,000 per day for a total of $4,000 (the plaintiff is not precluded from seeking further costs after damages have been determined), plus taxable disbursements; costs awarded on the defendant's application as a half-day Chambers application in the amount of $1,000, with the plaintiff to also pay the disbursements incurred by the defendant in filing the application; travel costs for the defendant's counsel to attend in New York; and the costs of preparation, travel, food and lodging for its expert witness to attend the discovery."
156,Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"This was an appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal granting a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant (plaintiff) against the respondents (defendants), the Lions Club and the Village of Bjorkdale. The action arose out of burns suffered the appellant while participating in a demolition derby with the assistance of the Fire Department. The appellant had modified his vehicle to the required standards, as well as to his own satisfaction in relation to its operation and safety, including the safety of an unconventional ignition system he had devised to give him an advantage in starting the vehicle whenever it stalled. He stopped the contest shortly afterwards, however, upon signalling his desire to have the contest halted and his vehicle had come to stop. Shortly after, gasoline from the gas tank located behind the driver's seat of the vehicle he was driving splashed on him and was set on fire shortly afterwards. He then caught on fire, exited the vehicle, and rolled on the ground for 30 seconds, several persons came to his assistance. One attempted to put out the fire with a fire extinguisher, which malfunctioned, while others managed to put it out with dirt. He did not do so immediately, not immediately noticing the liquid or gas or leaking from the fuel tank. This person was acting as a flagman, with power to halt the contest by waving his flag, but did not notice the appellant's desire to stop the contest. The fire was put out within 30 seconds of the time between the time he stopped and the time his vehicle came to a stop. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The Court applied the right test in addressing the motion to determine whether the plaintiff had adduced sufficient evidence, considered in its best light, to enable the jury, properly instructed and acting judicially, to find the defendants or the village liable in negligence. The issue was whether the Court had applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. There were a number of inconsistencies and weaknesses in the evidence, especially in the testimony of the appellant. He failed to establish the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents.","This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs."

She contended that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The Town disputes that such instructions were given and that, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not as a result of the water not being turned off, but rather because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $25,000 for the damage to the basement and $1,500 for the cost of repairs to the main floor.  1) The plaintiff did not own the house and that she was taking this action on behalf of her daughter. She acknowledged that she had not drained the water lines nor emptied the water tank and that there was still water in the lines after the power had been cut off. She was disinterested in the extent of the damage caused because the town had neglected to turn off the water.  2) The court was satisfied that the damage was caused by a burst water pipe in the basement causing the basement to flood. The plaintiff's claim was dismissed.","The plaintiff sues the defendant town for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst.

The mother had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself or the child since the date of the original judgment and had requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father also sought an order allowing him to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon for residential purposes. While the mother originally opposed both applications, at the trial of the matter, she no longer opposed the application for the grant of sole custody to the father, but she continued to oppose his application to be allowed to change the child's primary residence to Yukon. She also asked that she be granted less restrictive access. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner in the amount of $1,000. The court found that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the judgment and that the father had not been properly advised as to where the child was and therefore was unable to have access. The child was returned to the mother in June 2006 and placed in the care of the Court. The original custody order was set aside and a new order was made pursuant to s. 283(1) of the Criminal Code with respect to child custody. 1)The mother was found not guilty of the charge of child abduction. The evidence showed that the child had been removed from the mother's care by reason of neglect or abuse and that she had not consented to the order of the court to remove the child from Saskatchewan save with the father's consent. 2)The child was born in June 2001 and lived with the mother and the father in the Yukon until March 2002 when the parties relocated to Saskatchewan. The parties separated in January 2003 and the mother commenced an action seeking custody of, and maintenance for, the child in June 2003. She did not attend the trial and asked that the trial be postponed twice. The trial was adjourned twice at her request and the matter was finally heard on a peremptory basis on June 7, 2005. The judgment dated June 8, 2005 provided for shared custody with joint custody and shared parenting on a specific schedule. 3)The father was born and raised in Yukon but lived in the province from ages 2 to 7. He returned to live in Whitehorse in 2004 and resided there until 2006 when he returned to reside in Saskatoon. He and the child moved to Saskatoon in 2006. 4)The","The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly."

The grievance alleged that the university interfered with the applicant's academic freedom when it withdrew an invitation to be the keynote speaker at the National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding. The symposium was an initiative of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations and although the event was held on campus, the University was not directly involved. The applicant believed he was being invited to present the results of research he had more recently done for the Assembly of First Nations. He had received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Regina in 2004. A former student of the applicant was employed by the Federation as Director of Higher Learning and Research and was instrumental in the planning and organization of the symposium. She had invited the applicant to participate as a speaker. Later, after reviewing his thesis, she decided it would not provide a suitable foundation for the keynote address and advised him that his services would not be required. He sought to have the decision reversed.

The Court was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the arbitrators were entitled to make findings of fact in accordance with the collective agreement in force at the time the agreement was signed. 3) There was no evidence before the Court as to establish a prima facie case that the decision to withdraw the invitation was made in breach of the terms of the agreement. 4) The applicant was awarded costs in the amount of $1,000.","Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer. The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement. Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement. The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test. The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement. The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly."
160,Issue | Issue | Reason | Non_IRC | Conclusion Document : ,"The respondent pled guilty to the offence of failing or refusing, without reasonable excuse, to attend and complete an anger management program as required by a probation order. Sentencing was adjourned to allow a pre-sentence report to be prepared. On March 5, 2007, the Respondent was sentenced to a fine of $200 and again placed on probation for a period of 1 year. Among other things, the probation terms once again require the respondent to partake in anger management programming. As he concluded the sentencing, and without any discussion or explanation, the sentencing judge waived the victim surcharge. The surcharge was waived notwithstanding that the respondent had not requested an exemption pursuant to s. 737(5) of the Code. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge failed to comply with the explicit provisions of s. 730(1)(a) or alternatively, the explicit sections of s207(3), (4), (5), (6) and (7). Although the respondent has financial challenges, there is no evidence that they amount to undue hardship particularly given that the maximum amount payable in these circumstances is only $30. As stated by the Crown, the funds raised through victim surcharges play an important and vital part in the criminal justice system and it is important that sentencing judges pay serious attention to their obligations under s.730.","The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived. The appeal is made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The imposition of a victim fine surcharge under s. 737 of the code is mandatory subject only to an application under s. 737(5) relating to undue hardship. If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim surcharge, it is also mandatory that the Court give reasons. The sentence is varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $30."

He was previously convicted of a number of violent offences, including assault, break and enter and theft, assault causing bodily harm and breach of his undertaking, and is now charged with two new offences and with breaching the conditions of his previous release. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The accused's criminal record consists of 36 convictions, including six for assault or threats, and 11 convictions for failing to comply with court orders. These convictions include two convictions for driving offences, breach of probation and failing to appear in court. The accused did not make any admissions in relation to the alleged facts of the new charges. No admission was sought from, nor made by the accused, concerning comments made by him concerning the complainant, who was not representing himself. 2) There is no evidence that the accused made any factual assertions as to the facts of these new charges, nor that he self-represented. It is apparent from the transcript of the hearing that the complainant was not satisfied that the comments of the accused were not made within the meaning of s. 518 of the Code. The Crown has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt the seriousness of the offences against which the accused is charged. The evidence does not support the conclusion that the Crown has established that the alleged assaults were the result of premeditated, random or random acts of violence committed by an unknown assailant.","The accused brings an application pursuant to s. 520 of the Criminal Code for a review of the order denying him judicial interim release. HELD: The accused's continued detention is necessary for the protection of the public The Court puts significant weight on the accused's continued disregard of court orders and the fact that the number and severity of the assault incidents is increasing. The accused received the benefit of conditional sentence in April 2006 and in July was found to have breached the orders which formed part of the conditional sentence. He is now facing additional allegations of breach. Even though he was bound by conditional sentence and was charged with another violent offence, which is alleged to have occurred in September, he was once again released from custody in October.

The claim is grounded on a provision of the Union's by-laws which reads:Article XII - Indemnity Clause The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. The Union resists the claim asserting various defences. The primary defence is that the plaintiff misconstrues and misinterprets the by-law. HELD: 1) The Court should decline to become involved in the dispute because the Union is a voluntary association and is entitled to resolve its own disputes. 2) The Union may well make the city strong but it does not, apparently, make them all happy. The plaintiff had been president of the union for roughly 10 years when he was defeated in an election for that office in 2000. Several months later, the position of vice-president was in contest and the plaintiff put his name forward. He also lost that bid. 3) Defeat did not rest easily with the plaintiff and he again proffered his name for election for Reclassification Chair in September, 2000. The third time was charm and he was elected to that office. 4) From the moment the plaintiff's defeat in his bid for the presidency in 2000, his relationship with the union became rancorous. General meetings and sessions of various committees descended into dysfunction. It reached such point that the Union executive actively considered giving up self-government and placing itself in the hands of the National office. 5) In 2001, the plaintiff initiated a defamation action against three Union officers (Q.B. No. 664 of 2001). The Union defended and brought a counterclaim against the plaintiff for defamation by him against certain Union officers. 6) In 2002, the Union issued a report prepared by the National Office which led to the union executive seeking assistance from a CUPe National representative. The report stated that the union had become dysfunctional and that problems had intensified immediately after the election of Sister Lamon as president. 7) This is supported by many documents. 8) The union did not sit well with the statement of claim issued by the union representative in 2002. 9) In 2003, the union issued a statement of non-confidence in the plaintiff. 10) The plaintiff was awarded costs in the amount of $1,000 against the union.","The plaintiff is an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Union. He commenced this claim based on the Indemnity Clause contained in the Union's bylaws. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success."

The Attorney General opposed the application. The AG did not question his good faith in past dealings with his loans but contested whether he had and would continue to experience financial difficulty so as to be unable to pay the debt. HELD: The bankrupt was granted relief. The Court held that he had such financial difficulty that he was unable to meet his liabilities under the loan. This information did not form part of the decision and the quote from the transcript must be taken from the decision, not the information provided by the applicant. The court reviewed the other evidence respecting the other requirement under the subsection, namely whether his financial difficulty was so extensive that he will not be able to pay his liabilities. It found that it was not in the bankrupt's best interests to continue to be in debt because he had not demonstrated that he could not pay his obligations under the student loan program. The student loan debt including interest was approximately $20,000. The bankrupt had completed his university education at St. Francis Xavier University in 1989 and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Physical Education in 1997. He had been employed as a physical education teacher since 1997 and earned a Certificate of Full Performance in 2006. Presently, there was no opportunity to return to full time full time with the present annual salary of $16,272. His wife worked half time and they had two young children.

There were daycare costs when the wife worked, and the applicant's transportation costs were high (but reasonable). The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards. The applicant did not have any credit either. Their home had little, if any, equity. The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan. Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability. If the application were refused, he would have to consider bankruptcy."

The appellant applied for specified changes in the parenting arrangement. The Chambers judge ordered the appellant to pay basic Guidelines child support of $2,532 per month. He calculated the appellant's proportionate child support share and then ordered him to pay 73% of net day care costs and six specific extrasurricular activity costs pursuant to s.7(1.1) of the Guidelines. The respondent appealed. Appeal dismissed. The appropriate standard of review is that decisions by a Chambers judge in relation to child support orders are to be accorded significant deference. The issue of defining extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s7(d) and (f) and s. 7(1) is a common, routine, usual and everyday function of a family support judge and is based on the evidence filed for the purposes of the application. In this case, the appellant argued that the expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the definition of 'extraordinary' in s7.1. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the order set aside. The Court was unable to find any basis for setting aside the decision of the Chambers judge who on variation application ordered the father to pay proportionate shares of six of the 11 extracuarricular activities which the children were registered in and participated in at the time the application was made. The registration fees and lessons cost approximately $2000 to $2600 per year, exclusive of any transportation and incidental costs related to the activities.  1) The appellant expenses were found to be ordinary within s7 of the guidelines. The father's income since the date of the consent order was $147,000 and the respondent's income was $53,744.68. The increase in his income since then constituted a material change of circumstance. 2)There was no basis for interfering with the discretion of the Chamber's judge in determining the amount of child support to be paid by the father pursuant to the order. The order was made on the basis that he acted without any evidence that certain activities of the children, including Tae Kwon Do, soccer, voice and voice lessons, were extraordinary.  3)The Chambers judge failed to consider and apply the definition in the Guidelines of'special and extraordinary expenses'. The appellant argued the order should not be set aside as the result of the order was that five of the","This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal."

The defendant was in the business of building decks and sunrooms and had been for 18 years. The total cost to the plaintiff was $11,847.53. The project was to be completed in the summer of 2004. The plaintiff knew that the defendant would be ordering the material to complete the project after they had received the deposit. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1) The plaintiff was awarded costs in the amount of $5,529.13.  2) The court ordered that the plaintiff be compensated for the loss of profits from the sale of the sunroom.  3) Costs were awarded to the defendant in the sum of $2,200.00.  4) The sunroom was not manufactured in the plaintiff's home. It was ordered to be manufactured by the defendant's parent company AAA Aluminum Products Ltd. in B.C. and shipped to Saskatoon. 5) There was no evidence of pre-contractual negotiations or negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendant. The contract was executed without the knowledge of the plaintiff. The agreement was subject to the terms of the contract being satisfied.  6) There were four concrete piles to be used as the foundation for the wood deck upon which to sit the custom manufactured glass wall sunroom but the first hole filled with water and kept falling in on itself and the concrete piles could not be created at the original site. There was a high water table in the area unbeknownst to either the plaintiff or the defendant that the existing soil conditions communicated to Mr. Goertzen that he could not drill the piles due to the existing water table. The second concrete pile failed within two weeks of the attempt to create the pile and a further concrete pad was then poured and then filled in the holes. The third concrete pile was filled in and the fourth was filled and filled with sand and was then filled with concrete. The fourth concrete pile did not have the required diameter and depth for the foundation of the deck and was not filled in at the first attempt.  7) The defendant did not provide the plaintiff with an estimate of the cost of the project. It is not known if the plaintiff ever received a bid for the project or if the bid was never received by them. 8) The Plaintiff was entitled to judgment against the defendant for breach of contract.  9) The claim was reduced to $1,500.00 plus costs.","The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home. They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time."

More than a year has passed and the matter has noteven been set down for pre-trial.","FIAT: A previous interim order detailed specific access in the period leading up to pre-trial or trial, however more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial. The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order. HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.  The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children. The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order."

At his trial he was assisted by Richard Klassen. Following his conviction the appellant utilized the assistance of Klassan in preparing a notice of appeal in which the grounds are related to factual issues. The appellant abandoned Klasson and retained the services of a member of the Law Society. Included in the amended appeal was an affidavit of the appellant explaining how Klassens had come to be his agent in Provincial Court and raising concerns about his representations through the trial on the appellant's behalf. The affidavit is technically 'fresh evidence' meant to demonstrate the ineffective assistance of the agent. HELD: The appeal is allowed. 1) What standard of representation if any is an accused entitled to when represented by a non lawyer agent at trial? 2) Did the conviction result from a miscarriage in justice arising from the conduct of the trial? In R. v. Wolkins the Court found that the standard of performance of an agent is sub-par, although not as good as that of a lawyer. That however is not the test to be applied to the case of Dubelt. The case of CanLII v. Romanowicz (1999) provides an analysis that applies to the Dubelt case. It is not a case where the evidence is directed to a factual issue decided by the trial judge but rather to obtaining an original remedy from this Court. The process in situations like this has been developed by the courts so that an examination of the fresh evidence now before the Court is conducted to determine whether a miscarriage has occurred and if so, the new evidence will be admitted.","The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred. There was no unfairness in the trial process. The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant. He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer. 2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant. The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case. He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen. The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v.

He sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. The professor did not take the content of the attachment as a threat, but he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to the professor to cause his death, contrary to s.264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The appellant was found guilty and was sentenced immediately following the conclusion of his trial to an 18 month suspended sentence and placed on probation with conditions. An appeal commenced from conviction and sentence alleging improper admission of evidence, unfair and prejudicial cross-examination of the appellant and a failure to give due consideration to a conditional discharge. No formal amendment of the grounds of appeal was sought, but the appellant's brief also argued that the verdict reached was unreasonable. In terms of remedy, the appellant seeks an acquittal, a new trial or a conditional discharges. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to the respondent. The court reviewed the elements of the offence that the Crown needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, and was there sufficient evidence that would permit a reasonable trier of fact, properly instructed and acting reasonably, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on those elements.","An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment. The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor."

The older child applied for retroactive child support and s.7 expenses. He was not a child of the marriage at the time of the application. Although originally scheduled for argument in May, the court did not hear the preliminary motion on behalf of the respondent until August 19, 2009. He argued the court had no jurisdiction to grant relief for the older child because he was not with the marriage when the application was made. Alternatively, he took issue with the costs claimed by the younger child's mother with respect to both her retroactive claim for support and retroactive adjustment to the contribution he must make to the section expenses. An oral decision was delivered October 2, 2009 addressing the first issue; the court's jurisdiction to deal with the claim for retroactivity child support for the parties' older child. The remainder of the written decision addressed the second issue; determining the period for which retroactive support if any will be calculated for the younger son. HELD: 1) It is settled law that the court cannot entertain a child support application where the child is not subject to the charge of life; the child of a marriage is not a 'child of the Divorce Act' as defined in s.3(2nd Supp.), s.2(1) or under their charge but is unable, by reason of illness, disability or other cause, to withdraw from their charge or to obtain life insurance. The court is therefore precluded from ruling on the merits of the child support claim if the child wasn't a child within the meaning of s.5(1)(a) or (b) of the Act when he was under the age of majority or over and is unable or unwilling to withdraw.  2) The court has jurisdiction to determine the retroactive amount of child support payable by the respondent based on the evidence before it as determined in T.A.R. v. Henry, (2009) 1 S.C.L.(3d) 1. Section 7(b) requires a party to pay the sum of $1,000 per month for a period of 12 months. The respondent paid $500 per month in 2008. The parties agreed to vary the amount of support payable in 2008 and 2008. In 2009, the parties agreed that the respondent would pay $750 per month. In 2008, the respondent was to pay $600 per month and in 2009, he paid $600. In 2010","The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father."

The two properties roughly abut back to back. The Defendant did not live on or near either of these properties. He has worked in forestry all of his life, but is presently receiving a pension because of health problems. The issue is whether the Defendant is vicariously liable for the damage to the trees. HELD: 1) The trees were not visible from the home. The Claimants enjoyed all parts of their property which they accessed via trails they had cleared. The diameters at the base of the trees ranged from inches to as much as 20 inches. Many of them were 14 inches or so. The cutting activity was not obvious from the Claimant's home. 2) The claim was denied. The claim against the insurer was ultimately denied after an independent adjuster conducted an investigation which yielded nothing, if anything, to indicate that the trees were damaged or felled in any way on the insurer's land. The insurer was not required to investigate the claim. 3) There was no evidence of trespass or vicarious liability. The trees felled by mistake felled on the neighbour's property. It was not necessary for the insurer to conduct an investigation. 4) The Court reviewed the evidence of the neighbours and their neighbours' affidavits and photographs. The Court was satisfied that there was no breach of the peace of mind or breach of contract between the parties. The parties acted in good faith and good intention. The court found that the parties acted reasonably in accordance with the evidence and the parties gave to the insurer. There was nothing to suggest that either party acted in bad faith or with malicious intent. 5) There is no evidence to support the claim that the defendant cut the trees on his neighbour's land by mistake. The evidence does not support a claim for trespass. 6) The tree cutting was not done in a malicious or malicious manner. The defendant did not intend to harm the trees nor was there any intention to damage or destroy them. 7) The defendant was not responsible for any of the damage or loss of valuable or valuable trees. 8) The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs.","The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property. The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend. As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help). While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed. Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements). While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial."

From the plaintiff's viewpoint, the fact that she had the right to keep her residence and yardsite for as long as she wanted could easily have led her to exclude or disregard its value as a separate component of the value she was selling. It is understandable that at the time of the agreement neither therese Nadeau nor Clayton Clement gave much consideration to its value. Clayton Clement said he had no use for it, so it had no value to him. There is evidence to suggest that he was motivated to acquire the land for his own purposes, not just to help out the plaintiff by taking it off her hands and thus relieving her of the burden of owning it. In concluding that there was no pressure, duress or deception by the respondent, that the appellant was fully capable and fully capacitated, had entered into the contract with the intention of conferring benefit and fully understanding it, and that it was implemented fully for the benefit of the two parties, that this was not a case of unconscionsability or theft. The standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) had been met.","This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis."

The Defendant denies responsibility relying upon term of the rental contract which stated '... understand that the equipment rented is water resistant and not water proof' as well as posted disclaimers to this effect situated in several locations inside the truck box. HELD: The Court found that the plaintiffs were not precluded from recovery by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only and the posted disclaimer. The Court also determined that the quantum of damages was in issue. 1)The truck was not set on a flat surface for two days prior to being unloaded. Throughout this period it continued to rain heavily. 2)The packing blankets used to wrap the furniture had become soaked, which in turn caused moisture to seep into the goods. 3)The Court awarded the sum of $5,000.00 to the plaintiffs for the damage to their furniture and $1,500.00 for loss of usable usable capacity. 4)The court awarded the balance of the damages to the defendant.","The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants. The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners. This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned. Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions."

He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The trial judge imposed concurrent 30 month sentences for the production and possession offences, a sentence of 1 month for the attempt to produce offence and 5 months consecutive for the dangerous driving and evading police offences. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to the Crown.  1) The Court held that the trial judge erred in imposing concurrent sentences of 30 months to be served concurrently to the drug sentences, 5 months concurrent to the time served for each offence and 1 month consecutive to the sentence for dangerous driving.  2) The sentence for evading a stop without a lawful excuse was reduced to 5 months. The Court found that the sentence imposed was not fit and proper and did not engage the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under s. 686(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code. 3) The appeal against the conviction was allowed on the grounds that the appellant was unfit to stand trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, the appeal of a verdict of acquittal on the basis of mental illness should be set aside and a new trial ordered.  4) The conviction and sentence were both set aside.  5) There was no medical evidence before the Court as to the extent of the appellant's mental health problems or the extent to which they affected his ability to understand or participate in the trial process. 6) The evidence did not support the conclusion that he was incapable of forming an informed opinion or understanding the nature of the charges against him or that he had a mental capacity to participate in a trial.","The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit."

After the Crown had called all of their witnesses on the preliminary inquiry, asked Defence Counsel if they had any witnesses to call on behalf of the accused. They advised that they had one witness they wished to call but required an adjournment as that witness was not available to testify on this date. The Crown opposed the Defence adjournment request. HELD: The Court made a decision on this request. 1) It is significant that in the witness list forwarded by the Crown on February 25, 2010, they advised they would be calling four witnesses but Sergeant Barbar was not listed as one of those witnesses. 2) In June 2010, the Crown wrote to the Defence Counsel and the accused that they agreed to admit Sergeant Barbar's calculations regarding the accident and the crash data he accumulated. 3) In August 2009, Defence Counsel wrote the Crown requesting that they review his August 19th disclosure request and forward any further disclosure that had yet to be sent. 4) In December 2009, the accused elected trial by Queen's Bench Judge without Jury and requested a preliminary inquiry date.

Prior to the commencement of the hearing, defence counsel was aware that the Crown did not intend to call this person as part of its case. One month prior to the preliminary hearing, defence counsel requested that the accident reconstructionist be made available as witness. The Crown advised defence that the officer was out of the country on peace keeping mission. The officer was expected back within months of the commencement of the preliminary hearing. HELD: The defence request for an adjournment was granted. The Court could not be satisfied that the officer was not a material witness to the preliminary inquiry. The Court was not satisfied that defence was guilty of neglect in failing to procure the officer's attendance when they had been advised by the Crown that he was out of the country.

The plaintiffs' motion for certification sought an order appointing John-Paul Field as representative plaintiff for the class. An affidavit sworn by Mr. Field was filed in support of the motion. The defendant applied for leave to cross-examine Mr. field on his affidavit. Counsel for the plaintiffs opposed the application on the basis that an order for cross-examination under Rule 317(1) is an exceptional discretionary remedy that should not be granted routinely in any action, including a proposed class action. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendant in any event of the cause.  1)The general principles of applying the general principles to a class action certification application are set out in s. 317 of the Act. The applicant must establish, inter alia, the existence of an identifiable class, the common issues that the plaintiffs propose to certify as common issues, the exist of common issues in connection with the proposed class, and whether these common issues can be resolved by resolution of the class proceeding. 2)The applicant must show that the issues raised are issues that can only be resolved through settlement of class issues involving settlement of individual claims. 3)Cross-examination must be permitted on an affidavit in order for the application to succeed.","The plaintiffs have applied for certification of proposed multi-jurisdictional class action involving Paxil, prescription drug approved in Canada for the treatment of depression, anxiety, panic disorder and other conditions.

None support the proposition that proposed representative plaintiff is immune from cross-examination in respect of his or her individual claim. Cross-examination of proposed representative plaintiff may explore matters pertaining to his or her individual claim in the context of issue that must be determined by the court pursuant to s. and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act.

In July, 2010, they were served with a notice of an application for a community safety order under the Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act. The matter was originally scheduled to be heard on July 30, 2010 but was eventually adjourned and heard on October 6, 7, 13, 14 and 15. The trial judge rendered a written decision on January 6, 2011. An order was issued January 18, 2011, requiring the Property to be vacated on or before February 4, 2011 at 12:01 p.m. and enjoining the appellants from re-entering or re-occupying the property for a period of 70 days.

A fit global sentence of 8 years and 6 months was given, 4 years and 9 months for time spent in custody and 2 years concurrent were added to the sentence for each count; the surcharge was waived as the accused had no income. HELD: The court sentenced the accused to 8 years in prison, 2 years consecutive to each count and 1 year concurrent to the previous sentence, with a credit of 1 year for time served in custody. The court imposed a fine of $1,000 on each count for a total of $5,000. 1) The court accepted the accused's testimony that he had no employment or means to support himself and that he was unable to return to his former employment as a result of his incarceration. The accused admitted to opening 52 false accounts with SaskTel in fictitious names, 23 of which were obtained from obituaries. He used the telephone accounts to obtain the services of SaskTel, which included upwards of 835 telephone calls. When the bills were sent throughout Saskatchewan for the services rendered, there was no person responsible to pay them. As a result, SaskTel suffered a loss of $25,915.44. The second scheme involved credit cards. Accomplices outside the prison provided particulars of various credit cards and the accused would then access the account to order goods to be delivered to a third party and purported to make payment by way of credit card using the fraudulent credit card particulars. The total loss from the two schemes was $22,695.18. The credit card companies' losses amounted to $48,610. 2) As the accused has spent most of the last 30 years in jail, he has not spent much time in a penitentiary. He is the father of three boys, aged 12 to 14. He has a grade 12 education equivalent to the equivalent of 12th grade and has worked in the construction industry for a number of years. He had no criminal record. The defendant had a criminal record that included convictions for theft, mischief, theft of property, breach of an undertaking and theft of a recognizance or promise to perform an act of theft. The","The accused plead guilty to one count of using credit card data to fraudulently obtain services contrary to s. 342(3) of the Criminal Code, one count of fraud over $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1) of the Criminal Code for defrauding Sasktel of telephone services and one count of fraudulently personating various persons with intent to gain advantage for himself contrary to s. 403(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences. The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names. He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services. The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44. The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items. The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18. The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail. He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders. In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities. He plead guilty.

The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence."
182,Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s.253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and fined $1,000.00 and prohibited from driving for 1 year. He was acquitted of a second charge while his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit of.08. The trial judge concluded that, as a result of delay of approximately 45 minutes between the first attendance upon the first two officers and the time of the demand for the breath sample, the accused had been arbitrarily detained and advised of his right to counsel, which was in violation of his Charter rights. The learned trial judge ruled that the certificate of analysis was not admissible as evidence and found the appellant guilty of the first count. The appellant appealed. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction was set aside. 1) The learned judge erred in considering evidence that was not considered on the impaired count in convicting the appellant of operating motor vehicle while impaired; 2. The conviction constituted an unsafe and/or dangerous verdict in law; 3. The court rejected the evidence of the central Crown witness as this witness provided exculpatory evidence. There was no basis for rejecting his evidence and relied on speculation rather than evidence in arriving at his conclusion. The only symptom of impairment of any significance was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The breathalyzer operator testified that he noted the appellant appeared to have been drinking, that he had bloodshot eyes, he smelled of alcohol and that he formed the opinion that the accused was drunk.  and that having worked with the appellant in the past, he formed that opinion himself. The officer who administered the ASD demand testified that the only sign of impairment he noted was that he observed the appellant was in care of the motor vehicle and that his mouth was constantly moistened and his mouth moved as though he was constantly licking and smacking his lips.  3) The court found that the trial judge did not err in finding that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the driver was impaired.  4) The appeal against conviction on the count of impaired driving was dismissed. The first count was not found to be unsafe and dangerous because the appellant's blood alcohol level did not exceed.08 and the second count was found not guilty because the breath samples were not taken within the prescribed time frame. 5) There was an error in law in that the learned judge failed to consider evidence that could have resulted in a different conclusion.  6) There were three issues raised by counsel","The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict."

HELD: 1) The Court declined to vary the interim access order and ordered the matter to trial. 2) The respondent is intentionally under-employed and the Court imputed annual income to him of $130,294 and child support was varied accordingly. Section 7 childcare expenses are to be shared pro rata. 3) The Court declined to order interim spousal support as the Court was not satisfied that the respondent had the existing ability to pay it. 4) The issues regarding retroactive child support, ongoing child support, access and spousal support were directed to pre-trial conference. 5) Costs of $1,500 were awarded to the petitioner and payable no later than May 31, 2011."

The incident occurred in a common room at the Saskatchewan Penitentiary. The accused and the two alleged victims were inmates and were being held on 'B Block, a range designated for gang members. The two security videos were entered as exhibits and played during the trial. HELD: The accused is guilty of both counts. 1) The video evidence supports the conclusion that the accused was acting in self-defence. He acted in a fashion consistent with the conduct of a member of the general public. He did not use a weapon, he used common purpose and he acted with a degree of co-ordination with the other accused. 2) The court reviewed the video evidence and concluded that it was not in the best interests of the institution that the video be admitted as evidence. The video was not produced as evidence at trial. The court was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence was in support of the accused's version of events. The evidence did not support the conclusion of common assault or aggravated assault. 3) The accused's evidence was found to be inconsistent with the evidence of the two other alleged victims. It was not accepted that either was a victim of the assault. 4) The evidence showed that the knife was not used in a manner consistent with common assault, but rather was used in an attempt to protect the accused from an assault by another inmate. The knife was used to stab the victim in the neck, shoulder, arm and arm as well as the neck and shoulder. The blood was found on the accused. 5) The knife wounds were consistent with multiple stab wounds. The Crown has proven beyond a pattern of non-life threatening injuries.","In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not."

The accused was at large on his Recognizance entered into before a Justice or a Judge and was bound to comply with a condition that he not contact or communicate with the complainant except through a member of the Law Society of Saskatchewan. The complainant testified that she and the accused met through work and began their relationship; the accused had a criminal record dated 1999, which included a conviction for importing cocaine. The couple had four days off from work and decided to go shopping and drinking in Regina during which time they bought and consumed a large amount of cocaine, smoked some cocaine, snorted some cocaine and partied. HELD: The accused is guilty of all six counts. 1) The accused made threats to the complainant to cause her to die or be sexually assaulted contrary to s. 264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and s. 267(b) contrary to ss. 279(2) and 271(b). The accused also threatened to kill the complainant. 2) He was found guilty of assaulting the complainant and sexually assaulting her. 3) The Court found that the accused was guilty of inflicting bodily harm on the complainant, causing her to bleed to death or cause bodily harm to her assailant. 4) The Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt the accused's intent was to cause the complainant bodily harm. The Court was satisfied that the complainant was sexually assaulted by the accused and that the assault was premeditated. 5) The court found the accused guilty of committing assault and sexual assault under s. 271. 6) The complainant's testimony was corroborating the complainant's evidence that she had consensual sex with the accused. The evidence of the accused is corroboration for the evidence of a sexual assault and the sexual assault was not corroboration.","The complainant and the accused were in relationship and came to Regina where they stayed in hotel, drank, consumed cocaine and shopped. An argument ensued about missing shopping bag. The accused was charged with two counts of uttering death threats to the complainant; unlawfully confining the complainant; assault causing bodily harm on the complainant; committing sexual assault on the complainant; breach of recognizance in having contact with the complainant. At trial, both the complainant and the accused testified as to what transpired during the argument that resulted in the charges. HELD: 1) The accused was found not guilty of sexual assault. 2) The accused was found guilty of unlawful confinement. 3) The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The Court did not accept the accused's invoking of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused admitted to striking the complainant with a closed fist five times as hard as he could and the force used was excessive. 4) The accused was found guilty of threatening to kill the complainant at the hotel. 5) The accused was found guilty of uttering death threats and breach of recognizance by contacting the complainant. The Court did not accept his testimony and denial."
186,Issue | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"The accused was charged with three counts of sexual assault and two counts of touching a person under the age of 14 for a sexual purpose with his hands and one count of invitation to touch his penis. The accused was also charged with touching the penis of his 16 year old victim for the purpose of showing her how to undress. Accused found not guilty on all counts. The Court found that the Crown had not proven the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt. It was clear from the evidence that the accused was not the biological father of the complainant and that the relationship between the accused and the complainant was one of convenience and not one of love. However, the Court was satisfied that he had acted as a father figure to the complainant throughout the course of her life and that he was the de facto father of her children.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15. The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end."

The applicant is a Roma and a Romanian national who has resided in Canada since his arrival here exactly eight years ago. Romania seeks Mr. Cretu's extradition from Canada so that he might serve a three-year prison sentence imposed as a result of his conviction in that country, for criminally negligent homicide (an offence equivalent to that of manslaughter in Canada). Romania is represented in this proceeding by the Attorney General for Canada. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The applicant has not shown that he is a danger to himself or others in Canada. He is not a threat to society as a whole or to others in his native country. 2) There is no evidence to indicate that the applicant has a serious criminal record in either Canada or the Republic of Romania. 3) The Court is not prepared to grant an order for an order of committal in relation to this applicant.","The applicant applied for judicial interim release under s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed."

The accused used a baseball bat to strike the complainant five times on the head. The complainant suffered multiple, serious injuries to his head. His jawbone shattered, every bone in his face was broken, he suffered a brain bleed, his skull was fractured, he lost the sight in one eye and he may lose the eye altogether. He suffered memory loss and was unable to communicate with his family. HELD: The Court sentenced the accused to 24 months in a provincial correctional institution. The Court designated the aggravated assault as a serious violent offence and gave him a sentence of 18 months to be served in a youth institution.  1) The Court accepted the accused's testimony that the complainant struck him with the bat because he thought the accused pushed the complainant, who fell and hit her head, causing her to be knocked unconscious. The Crown did not oppose the Crown's application under s. 42 of the YCJA for a determination that the assault be designated as a'serious violent offence'.  2) The accused's record as a young person was reviewed and a letter of apology was given to the Court. The young person had a record of non-compliance with conditions of his youth sentence imposed by the Court including failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence that required him to report to his youth worker.  3) There was no evidence to support the accused’s claim that he was pushed by the complainant or that he struck her with the baseball bat. The evidence showed that the accused was not the aggressor and that he did not strike her in the head or in the neck or shoulder as she was lying on the ground. The physical evidence did not support any allegation that he pushed her or struck her.  4) The Crown sought the maximum allowable custodial sentence of 24 months and sought a fine of $1, restitution and a condition that he pay $500 to the victim’ s solicitor. The sentence imposed was reduced to 12 months.  5) The sentence was increased to 18 months. The aggravated assault was the result of repeated breaches of an undertaking under the Act.  6) The court accepted the evidence that the Crown had not proven the seriousness of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt","The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required."

The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a breath for analysis. The only issues to resolve were: (i) did the officer have reasonable Grounds to make the Intoxilyzer demand pursuant to Criminal Code s. 254(3); (ii) if a Charter breach was made out, is the appropriate remedy the exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis? HELD: The accused was found not guilty of both charges. The court found that the officer was reasonable in his observations of the accused and his reasonable belief that the accused exhibited poor muscular control, poor balance, slurred speech and poor ability to keep his head still. The evidence of the third Crown witness was called on voir dire and was the only evidence left for the court to consider in determining the Charter application.  1) The officer was in the process of determining whether or not to issue a breath demand for analysis when the accused indicated that he did not understand the standard police warning and that he would not be saying anything and directed that he be taken to the police station. When read the demand for breath samples and asked whether he understood, the accused said 'yeah, when we get there to the station'. This was followed up with 'when we get here'. The accused did not wish to leave duty counsel but rather called Legal Aid; duty counsel was reached 1 minute later and then the accused spoke to duty counsel for 3 minutes before returning to the accused's cell to call Legal Aid.  2) Because the officer had not received clear indication from the accused that he understood the demand the first time it was made, the officer made it a second time, at 12:43 and 12:41:41. The officer then read it a third time and asked the accused if he understood it and the accused replied 'yeah'.  3) The accused said he understood but did not want to go to Legal Aid and instead wanted to speak to private counsel.  4) There was no order as to the length of time the accused had been on the phone with Legal Aid or with duty counsel. It is common practice in","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded."

The accused was acquitted on the charge of drive while disqualified as there was no evidence before the court regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence. The issue was whether the GiO cycle which the accused was operating was a motor Vehicle as defined by the Code. HELD: The accused is not guilty of all three charges. The court found that the accused could not have been driving while impaired or under the influence of alcohol because the road conditions were generally dry with some wetness on the roadway and the accused had removed the pedals from the moped which indicated that it was operated by a person with limited ability to control it. It was not necessary for the court to consider the issue of impairment by alcohol in the context of the offence of driving while disqualified because the accused did not have a valid licence at the time of the incident.",The accused was charged with two counts being driving while impaired contrary to s. 253(1)(a) and refusal to provide a breath sample contrary to s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code. The Court had earlier acquitted the accused on the charge of driving while disqualified as there was no evidence regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence. At issue was whether the GiO cycle or moped which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code. The accused asserted that his GiO bike was operated that night by pedaling it as the electric motor was not working and asserted that driver's licence was not required to operate the GiO bike nor was he required to put licence plate on it. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges before the Court. There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped.

The defendant also applies under Rule 169 for leave to amend his Statement of Defence by pleading:3A Such words as were spoken or written by the Defendant are true, and the Defendant asserts that the alleged defamation was justified in law. This is a defamation action based on statements made about the competence of the plaintiff as a radiologist that the plaintiff says were published both before and after June 1, 2009. The statements made specific allegations about the plaintiff's failure to properly read an x-ray and alleged the plaintiff has failed certification exams and that health officials knew the plaintiff should not be doing the work he was doing. HELD: The application is dismissed. It is common law that the parties and actions can be combined for the purposes of judicial economy. The fact that the actions arise out of the same transactions or occurrences is relevant, but not determinative, in the absence of common questions of fact or law. Similarly, in Baynton J.Q.B. Financial Corp. v. 568320 Saskatchewan Ltd. (Saskatoon) it was stated that the law is permitted for the joinder of parties and civil actions for the two related related policy reasons under the principles of economy justice and time and expense of litigations. Economy of justice is usually realized through joinder to avoid multiple trials and to avoid the risks of inconsistent determinations of common issues in separate trials.","The defendant applied pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 169 for leave to amend his Statement of Defence. This is a defamation action and the amendment would add that the words spoken by the defendant were true and that the alleged defamation was justified in law. The action relates to statements made about the plaintiff's failure to properly read an X-ray and his failure to pass certain certification exams and that health officials knew that he should not be performing the work he was doing. There is another defamation action, described in this judgment as the College Action. The defendant applied pursuant to Rule 41(2) that his action and the College Action be tried together because there are common issues of fact between the two, albeit different actions.  Trying them together would be in the interests of judicial economy and avoid the possibility of conflicting findings. HELD: The Court ordered that the two actions be tried one immediately after the other in the manner determined by the trial judge and that the defendant be given leave to amend his Statement of Defence."

In his statement of claim, the representative plaintiff pled that he and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of the proposed appellant, McMillan. The appellants sought an order pursuant to Rule 173(c) of the Queen's Bench Rules striking the class action on the ground that it was devoid of merit. They opposed certification on the basis that the relationship between them and the respondent was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. The learned chambers judge dismissed the s. 173(C) application and certified the action as a class action against all defendants. The proposed appellant then applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 and Rule 49 of the Court of appeal Rules for an order granting them leave to appeal from the chambers judge's certification order and his dismissal of their Rule 173c application. They raised the following grounds in their proposed notice of appeal: 4(a) that the judge erred in law in failing to find that the relationships between the Respondent and the class members did not fall within the category within which existing precedent recognizes a duty to non-clients; 4(b) the judge failed to properly apply the Anns test in particular, conflating foreseeability with proximity in the first leg of the 1977 test, and by failing to consider and apply the policy considerations which may preclude or negate a finding of a duty in care under the second leg. 4(d) erred by finding that “the full extent of the conversations between Mr. Friedman and Mr. Scott were not before me but proper subject for evidence at trial when there was no conflict between the affidavits of Messrs. Scott and Friedman as to what had transpired between them. The only review of the facts is necessary to establish the respondent met the burden of establishing some basis in fact for the proposition that there was a duty owed to the appellant with respect to the subject matter of the claim. The within action arises out of the purchase by the respondent of the documents and procedures undertaken by the appellant prior to the date of the application. The material facts are fully canvassed in the learned Chambers judge's fiat. HELD: 1) The chambers judge correctly rejected the appellants' application to strike out the claim and certification. 2) There was no error of law in finding that the facts were so clearly in dispute as to warrant a finding in favour of the respondent","The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act."

He is 72 years old and practising internal medicine and rheumatology in the United States. The petitioner is 63 years old, deeply in debt, on long term disability and still caring for one of their children who will likely never be independent because he suffers from serious mental illness. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The respondent is entitled to vary the child and spousal support orders issued in 1998 and 2001. He also seeks a declaration that their three children are no longer children of the marriage.  2) The first few years after the separation were marked by a continual stream of vigorously contested applications. This was the eighth contested application as many years with the respondent gearing up to resist and the petitioner unable to afford more legal bills. 3) The petitioner originally hails from Zimbabwe and the respondent from Malawi. They had three children during their years together: Mandela was born in October 1978, the twins Bogani and Thabani were born in September 1984. The respondent moved to Ontario after the parties separated in 1988 and took a job with a medical clinic for about $175,000 per year. The children stayed with the petitioner in Moose Jaw. The wife was not able work as a registered nurse in Saskatchewan until she upgraded her education, which she did slowly over the years as and when she could afford it. She was unable to put the children into extracurricular activities such as soccer and they 'lived on sick leave, holiday pay and borrowing.' The respondent left his stable employment in Ontario in 1994 and moved to Milwaukee even though there was great demand in Canada for doctors with his specialties. He said that the prospects were better in the U.S. and he wanted to retire in the next few years. 4) From the very beginning, the respondent vigorously resisted paying much in the way of child support. He was adamant that he should not pay more than $2,000 a month total because she and the children ate a simple, inexpensive African diet and did not need more than that. He especially chafed by spousAL support obligations. He told the petitioner that he said to her 'you are not my relative why should support you?' 5) In 1997 the respondent was $46,000 in child support and just six months later, despite having shed $22,000 of the arreARS, brought an application for contempt.","The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927."
195,Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Conclusion | Conclusion Document : ,HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of two counts of sexual assault. The accused was sentenced to 40 days incarceration concurrent on each charge. The Court assessed the accused’s risk to re-offend using the Saskatchewan risk assessment for general criminal recidivism. The respondent was found to be in the low risk category for being charged with or being convicted of another sexual offence. The sentencing factors were: 1) the accused had a previous criminal record for sexual interference and sexual assault; in 1999 he was convicted of sexual interference contrary to s. 151 of the Criminal Code and sentenced to 2 years less a day incarceration followed by 1 year probation; in 2002 he was found guilty of fail to comply with a probation order and received a fine; in 2004 he was guilty of four charges of fail-to-follow-up with recognizance relating to a single incident where he attended the zoo with friends and their children. 2) The respondent had 12 cats that kept him company. He was divorced and lived alone with no children. He had been on social assistance since 1992 and indicated he had a back problem that prevented him from finding employment. He indicated he did not have any drinking or alcohol problems.,"HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault. The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats. The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability. The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years. The sentences were to be served concurrently."
196,Conclusion | Reason | Reason Document : ,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that there was no evidence of a conflict of interest between the parties as to the nature of the solicitor-client relationship between Mervin C. Phillips and the plaintiffs. It found that it was more likely that Phillips was acting for the plaintiff than for the defendants. It ordered that Phillips and his firm should be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiffs because of the potential for a conflict. It was not necessary that Phillips disclose confidential information to the defendants, only that he disclose it to the plaintiff.",HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.
197,Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason | Conclusion | Reason Document : ,"HELD: The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 259(4) of the Criminal Code. The Crown tendered a Certificate of Disqualification and Notice of Intention to Tender Certificate, marked Exhibit P-1 and P-2 for identification. The accused elected not to call evidence, arguing that the identity of the accused had not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt; there was no evidence proper notice had been given of the documents; service on a lawyer may not satisfy the notice requirement if counsel never agreed to accept service. The Court referred the matter to the following authorities: R. v. Babatunde O. Cole and Wan Loong Ma, 2011 ABPC 131 (CanLII), R.v. Kuznetsov, 2012 QBCA No. 28 (Sask. Q.B.B.) and Court of Appeal No. 79 Sask. The position of the Crown is that a certificate of disqualification is proof of a person’s ability to purport to be a person purporting to be signed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles without proof of the facts or official character of the person to whom it purports. In support of this position, the Court referred to R v. Vollman, 1989 SKCA 4LII. HELD: There was no Charter violation asserted. The Certificate of Qualification was not required to be served on the accused as notice simply needs to be provided to counsel based on instructions from the client, not on a request from the Crown. It was not necessary to serve the Certificate in the first place as the Crown did not indicate that it intended to serve it. The evidence was uncontradicted and the accused was found not guilty of all three charges. The court findings were based on the following: 1) an in-court identification is not necessary; it is sufficient that the individual with whom the police officer dealt has surrendered to the Court as demonstrated through the Appearance Notice; 2) the officer acknowledged that he was not asked to serve either of the exhibits; and 3) service on counsel is not required as counsel simply needs not be asked to provide evidence. The officer did not ask the accused to produce any identification.","The Crown found the accused not guilty. With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address. The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary. Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice. Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present. All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel. Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence. There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed."
198,Non_IRC | Issue | Reason | Conclusion | Issue | Conclusion | Conclusion | Conclusion | Conclusion Document : ,"The plaintiffs are the five children of Khristina and Chad Lawless, who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. Although the Lawless family has an English speaking background, from 2010 until 2013 the children attended a French language school, which was made possible by provisional permission to attend granted to the family by the defendant. During the children's time at the school, serious disagreements arose between the school administration and the children’s mother. The disagreement related to whether the mother and father were living up to the formal commitments they had given to the defendant in return for its provisional permission for the children to attend the school and whether the school was doing enough to accommodate the eldest child Trystan Lawless’ special educational needs. In February of 2013, the defendant informed the family that the provisional approval to attend École de Bellegarde would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. Shortly thereafter, the eldest Lawless filed a complaint with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging that the defendant had discriminated against him because he had a service dog. In August of 2013 the five Lawless children commenced this action against the defendant and then applied for an interlocutory injunction that would order the defendant to grant them ongoing permission. On September 10, 2013 the defendant applied to strike out the statement of claim. At the conclusion of the hearing, the application to dismiss the claim was reserved, while the application for an injunction was dismissed with written reasons to follow. HELD: The court dismissed both applications. Not all Canadian citizens have the right to have their children educated in French. It is common ground that the children could attend only if their children received primary or secondary school instruction in English or French, pursuant to s. 23(1) of the Charter of Rights and s.93(2) of any child of whom the parents did not, and do not, have a right to be educated in the language of the English linguistic minority population of the province in which they reside, or who have received their primary and secondary instruction in that language in where the language is the language in which the children reside or reside in a province where the children receive primary and/primary school instruction is in English/French. The court found that the plaintiffs had not met the onus of establishing a common ground between the parties.","Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction."
199,Non_IRC | Issue | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason | Conclusion | Reason | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Conclusion Document : ,"The accused was charged with impaired operation of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and operating a vehicle when the concentration of alcohol in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood contrary to ss. 253.(1)(b). The accused challenged the reasonableness of the police officer's suspicion upon which he based his ASD demand. The trial judge determined the officer's suspicions were not reasonable, which resulted in a breach of ss. 24(2) and (c) of The Charter. The accused was acquitted of both charges. The Crown appealed the acquittals of both of the charges. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were breached. 1) The officer did not notice any coordination or lack of motor skills by the accused when he observed the car drift to the left and strike the raised meridian which separated the westbound and eastbound lanes. The officer observed the vehicle drift three times to the right hand side of the lane with the passenger tires driving on top of the line marking the lanes.  2) The car was not speeding and, other than drifting back and forth, it was being driven in a normal fashion. It was not inattentive or in a hurry. It did not appear to be attempting to elude or avoid traffic control. 3) The ASD demand was made while the officer was standing beside the accused's vehicle. When the officer asked the accused to get out of the car and the accused complied, the officer observed his eyes were red and bloodshot and he appeared nervous and not comfortable about talking to the officer about what he was doing. The ASD test was administered and the officer noted that the accused looked nervous and nervous.  4) There was no medical evidence to support the ASD demand being made by the officer. The evidence did not support the conclusion the accused was inebriated at the time the ASD was administered.",The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.
200,Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"HELD: The Court held that it was not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as selling officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor. There were obvious difficulties with conflict of interest. The selling officer ought not to be the plaintiff’s own counsel. The setting of the reserve bid in a judicial sale is a requirement of s.16 of the LCRA. The Court agreed with the reasoning in Lundback that the proposed selling officer should not be the applicant’ solicitor. It was appropriate to have another member of the Law Society unconnected to the proceedings appointed as the selling officer. Grant Richards of Cuelenaere Kendall Katzman Watson Hagen will serve in this role.","The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi. It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price. Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000. If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs. Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff. Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application. All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful."
201,Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Conclusion | Conclusion Document : ,"HELD: The claim was dismissed. The court found that the plaintiffs had not proven that the defendants were responsible for the misleading and deceptive advertising of the “Low Sodium” beverages. The defendants denied liability on the basis that their “low sodium” label was factually correct and that no reasonable person would have assumed that the low sodium label meant that the beverages were lower in sodium than other alternate products. The plaintiffs abandoned their claims under negligence, sale, warranty and breach of goods legislation, after the oral hearing of submissions of defence. The original plaintiff’s claim was amended to include the claim of negligence, breach of warranty, violations of the Competition Act, RSC 1985, C-34 and various provincial consumer protection legislation, other statutory violations (i.e. the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act, the Food and Drugs Act, and the Consumer Product Safety Act) and unjust enrichment, waiver of tort and exemplary and punitive damages. The amendments were made to the claim in order to save the plaintiffs from having to attend a hearing to determine whether or not to proceed with the application for certification of the class action. The amended claim was not brought by the original plaintiff, but by the applicant, who was a class member of the proposed class. The amendment did not affect the original claim.",HELD: The court granted summary judgment for the defendants. It held that it could determine the defendants’ application prior to the plaintiffs’ application for certification. The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages. The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence. There was no genuine issue requiring a trial. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them. It was not necessary to decide the application for certification.
202,Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason Document : ,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that it was not in the interests of justice to order an assessment of the legal services that Brabant and Company Law Office (Brabant) had provided to the applicant band over a period of 23 years. The length of time for which the applicant sought to have the bill assessed was outside the 30 day time period provided by s.67(1)(a)(i) of the Act which establishes an assessment as a matter of right. The current Chief was removed from office in June 2014 and a Federal Court of Appeal decision granted a stay of that decision. There were other matters stemming from this turmoil including a bank refusing to recognize the Chief as entitled to the position and refusal to recognize trustees of the Treaty Land Entitlement Trust appointed by the Chief and the newly elected Band Council. The issues were employment issues, various lawsuits, land claim negotiations and implementation, land acquisition, trust administration, natural resource development, corporate registrations and Band governance and development of bylaws and policies to mention a few. The Court dismissed the application. It found that the entire time period sought to be assessed was too long and the application was premature. The Act does not provide for an assessment within 30 days of receipt of the bill.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice. The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated."
203,Conclusion | Non_IRC | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC | Non_IRC Document : ,"HELD: Appeal allowed. The Crown applied for leave to appeal. The summary conviction appeal court judge determined that the Provincial Court judge erred in finding the respondent, a member of the Regina Police Service, guilty of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code, set aside the conviction and entered an acquittal. The Court of Queen’s Bench held that the trial judge failed to take into account the totality of the circumstances surrounding the arrest and acquitted the respondent. The trial judge did not refer to the video evidence. The video evidence showed that after the arrest, the respondent exited his vehicle and knocked on the door of the respondent’ s residence and appeared to be putting on some protective gloves. The respondent did not enter the Brief Detox Unit (BDU). When asked if he wanted to fight, the appellant replied, “Do you want to fight?” The video showed that the respondent then took two or three steps towards the respondent and punched him in the abdomen causing him to fall backwards and injure his head. The appellant was charged and convicted in the provincial court of assault. He appealed his conviction to the summary conviction appeals court. The appeal court found that the judge erremed in finding that the evidence did not support the conclusion that the appellant assaulted the respondent because the video did not clearly show that the accused had punched the respondent twice in the stomach and that the assault was caught on security camera. The court reviewed the video and found that it was not clear from the video what caused the respondent to fall. It was also clear that the Crown had not proven that the offence was serious enough to warrant an order for aggravated assault. The conviction was set aside and the acquittal entered.  1) The appeal was allowed and the conviction reinstated. 2) There was no error of law or misapprehension of the evidence.  3) The evidence was not in dispute. 4) The court found with respect to the evidence that the police officer did not punch the respondent in the face or punch him on the ground. The evidence showed the appellant did not kick the respondent as he was fleeing from the area where he was being followed by the accused. 5) The Court found that there was no medical evidence to support the assertion that the force used to arrest the respondent was excessive force or that the arrest was in self-defence.","HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge. The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm."
204,Conclusion | Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason | Reason Document : ,"HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of both charges. The Court believed the testimony of the complainant. The accused’s actions were justified under the common law and the Criminal Code on the basis of her defence of property and the defence of a third person. The defence also argued that the complainant and police subjected the accused to an unlawful and unreasonable search and seizure, and infringed her rights contrary to s. 8(d) of the Charter. The evidence that was obtained following the unlawful entry into the accused's home was excluded. The court concluded that the court had jurisdiction to make an order pursuant to ss. 57(b) and (1) of The Child and Family Services Act. The order was not filed with the Court and the complainant did not indicate that it was a condition of the parental services agreement that the father of the children not be in the home. It was concluded that this direction was to be interpreted as meaning that the children were not in need of protection and therefore the child protection worker did not have to make sure the accused had the children in her care at all times. The Crown did not prove that this was not the case and, in fact, the children had been placed in the care of the accused prior to March 23, 2015 when the accused gave permission for the police to enter her home and search for the children.","HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached. Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home. The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house. The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights. The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children. The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights. The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence."
205,Conclusion | Reason | Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC Document : ,"HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The Court found that the accused had consumed alcohol in such a quantity that her blood alcohol concentration exceeded.08. She was also found to have the care or control of a motor vehicle while her ability to operate a vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drug, contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; and having consumed alcohol so in excess of.08 that she had the care and control of the vehicle, having a blood alcohol level of.07 or higher, having been behind the wheel for more than 30 minutes and having trouble keeping eye contact with the officer. The accused’s blood alcohol content was.08 as a result of two vodka shots. The court found that, given the circumstances, the accused was not impaired. The police officer testified that he was unable to get another police unit to attend the scene and left the scene at 6:12 a.m. because he was tired and wanted to wait for the tow truck to arrive. The officer admitted that he could not remember if the accused admitted to drinking, but he suspected that she was drinking. The evidence showed that the police officer who arrived at the scene first smelled alcohol emanating from the vehicle and could smell it emanating from inside the vehicle. He was advised to assist a recruit who was also being investigated for impaired operation of a vehicle. At 5:25:29 he asked the ASD to get the breath samples. The breath sample demand was at 5:41:30. The trial judge found that there was nothing in the ASD report that indicated that the officer had any reason to suspect that the driver had been impaired.","HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice. The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it; and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained. However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately. The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code."
206,Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Conclusion | Conclusion Document : ,HELD: The Court granted the accused a curative discharge pursuant to s. 255(5) of the Criminal Code. The Court reviewed the evidence in support of the accused’s application. It found that the accused had made significant and positive changes in her life as a result of her treatment and that the Court was unable to place a value on the evidence as it did not include all of the information requested by the accused.,"HELD: The accused was granted a curative discharge. The court found that the accused had met the required onus of this type of application in accordance with R. v. Ahenakew. The accused’s conduct over the past 18 months satisfied the court on the balance of probabilities that hers was an exceptional case and that a curative discharge would not be contrary to the public interest. The court imposed numerous conditions on her, including that she could not have or consume alcohol and should report to a probation officer, receive addiction counselling, participate in AA meetings and provide proof of her attendance to her probation officer. Her driver’s license was cancelled and she was prohibited from driving for two years."
207,Conclusion | Reason | Conclusion Document : ,HELD: The court found that the maternal grandmother was of sufficient interest with respect to the two children and that it would be in the best interests of the children to move them from the primary care of the mother to the father’s care. The father was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $193 per month. The court determined that the father was not required to pay any child support for the children if the grandmother was successful in her request for primary care.,"HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent. They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support."

The Court sentenced him to time served in a provincial correctional institution. The accused had pled guilty to all three charges. HELD: The Court imposed a sentence of 18 months imprisonment followed by 3 years probation with conditions.  1) The Court was aware that no sentence would relieve the families of the pain they have endured and are enduring and may well continue to endure for the rest of their lives or the deep remorse the accused has as 'the boys faces are tattooed in his brain'. There is no remedy for the total destruction caused as a result of the accused’s inattention for whatever reason as he drove his huge heavy semi-trailer through the construction zone on that fateful day over two years ago. There is really nothing that the Court can do to remedy what has happened. It cannot be remedied. The only thing the court can do is to sentence the accused in accordance with the objectives and principles of sentencing as contained within the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C‑46. 2) While the Court is aware that the pain of the victims’ families is palpable, the one thing all of them really want is the return of their loved ones. That cannot happen. 3) The accused was given credit for 22 months spent in custody. The sentence was increased to 45 months for good behaviour and 21 months for each count.  4) There was no mention of the fact that the accused had a previous record for motor vehicle offences, which included operating a vehicle that was uninsured and having a licence that was not registered to him. The Crown did not raise the issue of whether the accused should have a licence to drive. The court found that the evidence did not support the conclusion that he had a prior record of driving offences. The evidence showed that his driving record was clean and his driving style was consistent with his knowledge of the laws and regulations in the province.","The accused was found guilty of three counts of dangerous driving causing death, contrary to s. 249(4) of the Criminal Code, and one count of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, contrary to s. 249(3) of the Code. During his employment as professional truck driver, the accused had driven into construction zone on highway and hit another vehicle that had been stopped. The three teenage occupants of the vehicle were killed and flag person was severely injured as result of the collision. The accused was sure that he had not been asleep at the time of the accident but felt that he had not been paying attention. He had not noticed any of the signs posted at 100-metre intervals after the start of the construction zone 1.6 km south of the accident. The accused was 41 years of age. He had obtained his A-1 driver’s licence in 2009 and had clean driving abstract. He was married and had three children. He had recently been diagnosed with mild sleep apnea. He expressed remorse to the victim’s families and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.| HELD: The accused was sentenced to three years in imprisonment on the first count and three years concurrent for the second and third counts, and one year concurrent to the other counts on the fourth count. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment. The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person. The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone. The mitigating factors were that the accused pled guilty and expressed profound remorse. He had not been drinking and had a clear driving record. The accused was at low risk to re-offend."

The court found that the respondent did not meet the criteria for a fair and equitable division of the family home and property. The petitioner had not proven that she had not earned sufficient income to meet the guidelines for child support and spousal and child support, nor had she met the threshold requirements for an equal division of family property.  1) The petitioner’s income was not in excess of $245,000. 2) The respondent was awarded interim primary residence of the child and access. The child was born in Pakistan and the petitioner and the respondent immigrated to Canada in 2005. They initially lived in Vancouver, before relocating to Saskatoon in 2008, then to Ottawa in 2012, and then to Regina in October 2014. The parties had a series of temporary separations, the final separation occurring in April 2014. In April 2012, the petitioner petitioned the court for divorce, joint custody and shared parenting of the son, and an equally divided family home. The same day, he obtained an without notice order granting him interim parenting time and prohibiting the respondent from removing the child from the jurisdiction. The respondent subsequently applied for interim child and spouse support. In January 2015, the respondent filed an answer and counter petition, opposing the petitioner's claim for shared parenting and an equal split of the property, and claimed divorce and joint custody of their son and an unequal division of their home.  3) The parties were married in December 2001. They have one son, D.K. (also known as D****). Following the parties’ birth, the family moved to Canada. The family moved again in August 2012, to Ottawa, then in October 2013, to Regina, and back to Saskatchewan in October of that year. The wife was able to commence maternity leave approximately one month prior to the date of this application. She filed an amended answer and a counter petition in April 2015, abandoning her claim for an unequal split of family home in favour of equal division. The action was subsequently pre-tried without success. 4) There was no order as to the amount of child support payable.  5) The wife did not prove that she earned more than $100,000 per year. She did not establish that she was earning more than she was responsible for the household expenses. She was entitled to child support of $1,900 per month. She failed to show that she did not earn more than the guidelines amount for child care expenses.  6) The court","HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period."
210,Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Reason | Reason | Conclusion | Conclusion Document : ,"HELD: The accused has applied to exclude certain evidence discovered by the police during the execution of a search of his computer and cell phone. The evidence was not part of the evidence at the original voir dire as there had been no evidence presented as to the nature of the seized material nor the location from which it was seized. The issue of exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter was not determined at that time. Following the judgment of January 3, 2017, it was proposed by counsel that the Crown would proceed with its case, calling all of its evidence, following which a s24(2), determination would be made. As a result, the trial resumed on February 6, 2017 with the Crown presenting all of their evidence. The results of the seizure were marked as exhibits for identification. The determination of their ultimate admissibility was to await completion of an argument on s.24(1) analysis. Following this determination, the accused will then present his case. The accused’s application for exclusion was dismissed. The Court found that the accused had not met the onus to prove that the search was a violation of his s.8 Charter right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. The search was lawful and proportionate to the scope of the search and was carried out within the meaning of the warrant. The Information to Obtain (ITO) only authorized a search for the “search history” as set forth in the warrant, which was the only information sought. The ITO did not include a general search of the internet history or pictures of the complainant. The officer testified that the complainant told him that he had taken a picture of her while she was naked and in the shower. This information was not included in the ITO. The warrant did not specifically authorize the search for pictures on the computer or for messages between the complainant and the accused. The police officer testified he was the one who delivered the computer and assistance request to the officer who made the request for assistance. He testified that it was he who read into the warrant the general search history of the computer. He also testified that he gave the officer instructions to search for photos and videos depicting child pornography. He did not indicate that this information was included in his assistance request. The court found that this was not the case to exclude the evidence and that the evidence was found to be of sufficient quality to support the conclusion that the police had exceeded the limit of their search pursuant to the warrant and therefore, the","HELD: The application was allowed in part and the balance of images found on the computer were excluded from the evidence at trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The court found that the evidence found through temporary Internet sites was admissible. The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer. The police had no authority to search the computer generally. They were only authorized to look at the Internet history. The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right. The temporary files created as a result of the visits on the Internet was evidence of Internet history, and because of this connection, this evidence was not excluded."
