5_2018skqb216.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The plaintiff bank applied by notice of application for a deficiency judgment against the defendant pertaining to the non-purchase money portion of the outstanding indebtedness to the plaintiff pursuant to her mortgage and to some other costs related to the mortgage. The original mortgage executed by the plaintiff was for $191,000 of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium and $15,000, eight per cent of the total, was advanced for other purchases. The property sold for $156,000 pursuant to a judicial sale. The sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, commission, and the principal and interest due under the mortgage in the amount of $141,945 and the net sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata. As at November 1, 2017, the principal and interest owing on the non-purchase money portion of the mortgage was $21,250. The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment. It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage. The issue was whether such costs should be subject to the pro rata calculation for the nonpurchase portion of the mortgage, that is, 8 percent of the total costs incurred.  HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to a deficiency judgment for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested. It was also entitled to judgment against the mortgagee for eight percent of the solicitor-client costs, condominium fees and property management charges.","FIAT: Royal Bank of Canada applies by notice of application for a deficiency judgment pertaining to the non-purchase money portion of the outstanding indebtedness to the defendant, Partridge. RBC also applies to have its lawyers' costs assessed on a solicitor-client basis. The issue is whether the pro rata distribution applies solely to the indebtedness of principal and accrued interest or applies to all costs under the mortgage. HELD: 1) Royal Bank is entitled to solicitor costs in the amount of $4,500.  2) Partridge applies for taxable disbursements of $121.47, non-taxable disbursement of $180.00 and the applicable GST and PST. 3) The plaintiff also claims two other charges pursuant to its mortgage. First, RBC has paid to the condominium corporation the sum of $2,528.90 for arrears of condominium fees. Pursuant to s. 63 of The Condominium Property Act, 1993, SS 1993, C-26.1, the cond condominium fee paid by RBC are assessments levied against the mortgagor's land and are recoverable under the terms of the mortgage;  the sales proceeds from the judicial sale are referred to as the net sale proceeds to be distributed pro- rata between the purchase money and non-positions owing. The property management charges of $1,461 were added to the deficiency judgment along with the prorated principal and interest due.  4) RBC claims it was required to incur the extra legal costs to proceed by judicial sale in order to pursue recovery of the deficiency against Partridge because it should not have the solicitor‑client costs.  5) The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Walker was not required to address the procurement of solicitor costs because the parties had consented to having the matter remitted to the Queen's Bench judge. However, Walker is instructive in explaining the policy objective of s. s. of the LCRA. In this case the total of the assessed solicitor costs, the total condominium and secured by the mortgage was 8% of the total outstanding mortgage amount.  6) The property sold pursuant to an order Nisi for Sale by Real Estate Listing for $156,000. In accordance with the Order Nisi, and as set out in Rule 10‑47(5)(c) of the Queen’s Bench Rules and its corresponding Form 10-47C, the sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, real estate commission,"
e_2016skca29.txt,"HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge. The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm.","The Crown appealed the conviction of Constable Power, who was charged and convicted in the Provincial Court of committing an assault causing bodily harm, pursuant to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The summary conviction appeal court judge determined that the trial judge had erred in finding that the appellant had used more force than was necessary to either defend himself or effect the arrest of Mr. Stonechild under s. 25(1). The Crown applied for leave to appeal the decision of the Summary Conviction Appeal Court. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction was entered in the provincial court. The conviction was reinstated. 1) The trial judge did not err in his assessment of the force used by the appellant. He did err in considering the nature and extent of the assault, the circumstances in which the appellant found himself and in the situation in which he found himself. 2) In assessing whether there is an air of reality to the proportionality requirement, that is whether the responsive force was no more than necessary in all of the circumstances, the judge instructed himself to disregard evidence of the Crown and the defence judge and to measure the force use to nicety. 3) The Court found that the evidence showed a fairly minimal level of force by the respondent in terms of proportionality. The force used was not one that reasonable person in the position of the appellant might be expected to employ. It necessarily follows that a verdict of not guilty is entered."
8_2012skpc79.txt,"The accused's neighbour disliked the accused and alleged that the accused drove his vehicle into hers. The police arrested the accused and found a fob that operated the locks on the doors of the vehicle and the engine hood of the accused's vehicle was warm. The accused was charged with hit and run and impaired driving. HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of both charges. The Court found that the police breaches of the accused's Charter rights were numerous. The approximate 11 minutes of investigative detention was not an infringement of his rights but the combination of the officers' failing to inform the accused of the reason for his arrest and not giving his rights to counsel without delay, coupled with the illegal search and seizure of the fob and keys were in total breaches serious enough to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which further weakened the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown failed to prove the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.","The accused was subject to an application under s. 24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence allegedly because of breach of his rights under the Charter. The primary defence was that the police officer who detained the accused did not inform him of the reason for his detention, nor did he advise him that he could consult counsel. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of both charges.  1) The police had the requisite subjective and objective grounds to detain the accused. However, they did not have the means to detain him. The police officer, who had remained with the accused during the alleged operation of the vehicle, was not aware of the reasons for the detention and did not advise the accused of his right to contact counsel. The exclusion of the evidence of the fob and keys further weakens the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.  2) The accused wishes to exclude all of the other evidence that occurred after his detention pursuant to s.24(2). In R. v. Mann, the Supreme Court reviewed the concept of 'Investigative Detention' and concluded that there is no general power of detention for investigative purposes, however, police officers may detain an individual if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that, in all the circumstances, its detention would bring the administration of justice into disrepute."
d_2013skqb90.txt,"The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","The trial judge found the plaintiff had proven liability with respect to a damaged triple-ply beam, the cost of which was a small part of the claim. The trial judge then awarded damages for repair of broken concrete grade beam and for other repairs in an amount much higher than damages would have been for the triple beam notwithstanding that liability as to the concrete grade beams was not established at trial. The defendants appealed. Appeal dismissed; the trial judge made no palpable and overriding error regarding the calculation of damages and the parties had not met the high onus of establishing that a reasonably informed person would have an apprehension of bias on the part of a trial judge who was experienced in investigating, diagnosing and repairing foundations. Although the plaintiff was self-represented, more questions were required than may have been appropriate in a traditional civil trial. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. 1)The trial Judge made no evidential or overriding error in the calculation as to damages. While there was uncertainty about the timing of the breakable wooden beam, it could have been discovered by the respondent or his property inspector. There was no evidence that the amount of work done was not necessary to repair the damage done when the foundation caved in and water entered the basement.  2)There was a strong presumption of impartiality and the law should not carelessly evoke the possibility of bias in a judge whose authority depends upon that presumption. It was clear from the case law that trial judges do not rest mute and are entitled to seek appropriate clarification and give direction and, in certain cases, disclose tentative conclusions as means of ensuring proper understanding of the case."
4_1994canlii4625.txt,"At trial in Provincial Court, the accuseds called no evidence and were convicted. They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance. 2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds. 3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.","Appeal from Provincial Court. The question was whether the evidence adduced by the Crown - the defence called no evidence - was insufficient to such a degree that a trial judge's verdict of guilty ought to be found by this Court either unreasonable or one that cannot be supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The procedural point raised by the appellants had no merit. It was readily resolved by examining the circumstances immediately preceding the infliction of the injuries by looking at the photographs of the victim taken the following day by the opinions of both the counterman at the 7-Eleven store who saw the victim shortly after the injuries were inflicted and called the police, and of the investigating officer who saw him shortly after that. 2)There was sufficient evidence for the trial judge to reach a conclusion respecting the cause of the injury beyond a reasonable doubt without resorting to medical opinion. On the question of identity, it was true that there was no direct evidence to implicate either party. There was, however, strong circumstantial evidence. It is fair to infer that the victim received his injuries at the spot where the pool of blood was found. However, the argument that the Crown failed to present sufficient evidence to present an offence or indeed an offence of any kind, to warrant a jury's intervention was not supported by this substantive argument. 3)In either case the Circumstantial evidence of opportunity was sufficient to sustain a finding of identity beyond areasonable doubt.  4)The Court of Appeal relied on s.686(1)(a)(i) of the Code which provides: 651(3)Where no witnesses are examined for an accused, he or he is entitled to address the jury last, but otherwise counsel for the prosecution is required to address that jury last. In this case, the 'other inculpatory evidence' of motive and hostility, puts the present case into the category of one where'something less than exclusive opportunity may suffice'."
c_1993canlii4474.txt,"The parties lived together for 14 years and had three children, aged eight, 13 and 14. The petitioner always worked and eventually became a successful stockbroker. The respondent was employed part-time doing minimum wage jobs and was responsible for the household duties and raising their children. The petitioner's annual income was $50,000 at the time of separation, but escalated to $200,000 in 1992 and was prone to great fluctuation. The respondent was to have custody of the children. She sought spousal and child support and an unequal division of assets. Ordering support and an unequal division of assets. The court extensively reviewed the case of Moge v. Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L.(3d) 345 (S.C.C.) and found that marriage and child care responsibilities hinder a wife's role in the workplace. The court awarded $4500 per month as spousal and child support, plus an additional $500 while the wife retrained. The court considered this an appropriate case for an unequal division of matrimonial assets in the respondent's favour. Finding that the awards were still not sufficient to satisfy the respondent's needs, a lump sum award of $18,000 was ordered. On appeal.","The parties, along with their mother, decided to buy and operate a coffee and donut franchise. The mother was the primary caregiver, to perform the major part of the homemaking chores and to supplement the family finances by employment. The father sought an unequal division of matrimonial assets and liabilities, seeking an order specifying the terms and conditions of a deferral of a $20,000 loan which was to be paid in installments. The wife was to continue working at the franchise, but wanted her to take a tourism course to learn how to improve her tourism skills. HELD: 1)The Court was satisfied that the ground had been proven and there was no possibility of reconciliation between the parties. 2)The trial judge was left with exercising her or her discretion to determine the effect of the marriage in impairing or improving each spouse's future economic prospects and attempting to achieve an equitable sharing of the economic consequences of their marriage breakdown.  3)The court found that the 'needs and means' test is not the exclusive basis for determining spousal support under the 1985 Divorce Act. 4)The test is to be set out in the Act and not upon the trilogy cases Pelech v. Peleech, [1987] S.C.R. 801 and Richardson v. Richardson which advanced principles which should be restricted to consensual situations. In Moge, the Court held that the law should have two primary objects: to adopt a philosophy of interspousal maintenance that does not tend to compel a sexually-determined mode in which marriage functions are divided, leaving it to the market place of social custom as to how individuals will arrange their marriages in future; and to ensure that the economic disadvantages of caring for children rather than working for wages are removed. It is in situations such as this that the trial judge has to utilize great ingenuity in determining the reasonable standard of living to which the wife is entitled and in deciding what factors should be included in reaching this conclusion. 5)The respondent was to pursue an education and teaching career but, in any event, she was responsible to supplement her income to the extent necessary to meet that standard. The Court was to find a balance between the temporal limit on maintenance to encourage the acquisition of self-sufficiency and the allowance of unlimited maintenance to cover the shortfall in the spouse's employability."
9_2011skqb49.txt,The applicant was a student at the University of Saskatchewan in the College of Medicine. He was required to discontinue his studies for failure to meet academic standards for promotion. The applicant appealed his dismissal and was unsuccessful throughout. He applied to the Court for an order of certiorari to quash the decision of the Academic Appeals Committee and the University Bylaws Committee Council and an order reinstating him as a student at the College of Medicine pending resolution of his appeal. HELD: The Court found that the Bylaws Committee Council exceeded its jurisdiction by reviewing the previous decisions made and drawing the conclusion that they were made fairly and properly. The Bylaw Committee determined the merits of the applicant's appeal and determined that it was not necessary to convene a full appeal board. There is nothing in the University policy to suggest that the Bylaws Committee has that power. The Bylaws Committee has exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard and its decision is quashed. The matter is returned to the Bylaws Committee to determine whether the applicant's appeal falls within the policy on student appeals and academic matters. The portion of the application requesting reinstatement of the applicant as a student pending the resolution of his appeal is dismissed. The applicant has a marginal academic record and there are a limited number of placements in the College of Medicine. It does not make sense to displace another student or require the College of Medicine to train a marginal student on a potentially temporary basis.,"The applicant was required to discontinue his studies for failure to meet the academic standards for promotion. He applied to quash a decision of the Academic Appeals Committee of the College of Medicine and of the University Bylaws Committee of Council. HELD: The application was dismissed. The certiorari application was allowed. On the assumption that his applications will be successful, he seeks an order reinstating him as a student at the college of medicine pending resolution of his appeal. The purpose of the appeal is to review the previous decisions that were made insofar as they come within the parameters set out in para.1(a) of the policy. It is not appropriate however for the Court to usurp the function of the Bylaw Committee and review the material to determine if in opinion, the matter should be remitted to the appeal board under Part V, para.3(3).

8_1994canlii4691.txt,"The landlord applied for possession of residential premises after his tenants refused to vacate in response to a written notice to vacate. The deputy rentalsman ordered that the landlord should have possession, but also ordered that the last two months rent would abate in order to assist the tenants with their moving costs. The landlord appealed the abatement of rent and a chambers judge reversed the deputy rentalsman. The tenants sought and were granted leave to appeal the chambers judge and this appeal resulted. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The chambers judge could only reverse the deputy rentalsman if he exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law. 2)The deputy rentalsman had jurisdiction to order an abatement of rent pursuant to S.47(4) of the Act. 3)The jurisdiction is a discretionary one. The court will therefore show some deference to a decision of the rentalsman involving this jurisdiction. In this case the deputy rentalsman made no reversible error.","The issues in this case began long before the notice of termination of tenancy (which ultimately prompted this Court's involvement) and stem from a number of complaints made by both the tenants and the landlord. The landlord began leasing his premises to the tenants in August 1994. The tenants applied first to the Rentalsman's Office for an order directing the landlord to remove a stove, replace a refrigerator and make appropriate repairs to floor tiles, fence and gate. The deputy rentalsman heard the tenants' applications in two separate hearings and had access to Matheson J.'s written judgment. In the third hearing, the landlord in the second hearing wanted a writ of possession so as to assist with relocation costs. The Deputy rentalsman granted this order and the tenants appealed it. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the rentalsman was restored. As neither the landlord nor the tenant was represented by counsel, there was no order as to costs. 1)There was little or no chance for the parties to reconcile their differences whatever they may be. The differences between the landlord and tenant did not solely arise from reasonable complaints by the tenants. Some deference must be shown to those aspects of the rentalman's decisions which reflect an exercise ofretion. 2)The deputy had the authority to abate rent under s.47(4) but it was restricted to finding an error of law or jurisdiction."
c_1993canlii5621.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexually touching a young girl who was under the age of 14. He contended the trial judge erred by permitting the complainant to testify behind a screen without first conducting a voir dire and by relying on Crown's submission the girl would be uncomfortable without the screen.

Dismissing the appeal, that the fairness of the trial was in no way impaired by use of the screen, and no miscarriage of justice occurred.

The first ground of appeal alleged that the trial judge was in error by permitting the complainant to testify behind a screen without first conducting a voir dire and by relying solely upon the representations of the Crown counsel to the effect that she would be uncomfortable without a screen. The defence successfully argued that the verdict was unreasonable and was not supported by the evidence. Dismissing the appeal and ordering a six month incarceration sentence, that there was evidence before the trial court to reasonably support the conclusion that he reached. The complainant was under 14 years and no issue of consent arose. The appellant did not testify and the complainant described how he had in fact had intercourse with her under circumstances that would suggest it could well have been expected."
c_2014skqb284.txt,HELD: The court dismissed both applications. The respondent’s voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income was insufficient grounds to vary his child support application. The court found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances with regard to the petitioner’s application.,"The respondent father has applied to reduce his child support obligation and to extinguish arrears of child support as a result of him quitting his job and embarking on an apprenticeship program to become an electrician. Both parties have two children who are now eight and nine years of age. The children reside with the respondent who has not been exercising access and has had little involvement in the lives of the children.HELD: The application to vary child support by the respondent is sought to be varied pursuant to s. 10 of the Family Maintenance Act, 1997 in which there must be a material change in circumstances to warrant variation of the child support order. The preliminary question is therefore whether voluntary change constitutes material change. For a voluntary change to be material change it must be reasonable in the circumstances. The respondent's voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income is found to be insufficient grounds to vary the existing order, and the petitioner's application in this regard is dismissed."

Such an appeal can be taken on the following grounds: (a)the committee exceeded its jurisdiction; (b)it failed to observe the rules of natural justice; (c)it made an error of law; (d)its findings can not be reasonably supported by the evidence which it was entitled to consider. 2) The Court found no error of jurisdiction or failure to observe the rules of natural justice. 3)The Court found no palpable or overriding error in the facts as determined by the Committee based on the evidence.",A medical doctor has been reassessed and ordered to repay money for billings already received as a result of services provided to patients.

There was no evidence to support the decision of the Committee on this merits. 2)There was insufficient evidence before the Committee to constitute proof that Huerto's delivery of medical services was unacceptable from a medical perspective. The Committee committed an error in law by undertaking a review at the request of the College of Physicians and Surgeons and not the Director of Medical Professional Review Committee. 3)It did not exercise its discretion to determine whether the Committee's findings were reasonably supported by the evidence and the material which it was entitled to consider. 4)No error was made. 5)Costs were recovered by the Committee.
9_2010skqb122.txt,"FIAT: This is an application for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act requiring the respondents or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of construction equipment. The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008. Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009. In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head. In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration. Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment. In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number. The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment. Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096. September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head. The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken. On October 19, 2009, 101138096 forwarded a letter to Giants Head confirming that 101138096 had elected to retain the equipment as payment for the outstanding indebtedness. As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment. Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008. The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009. This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession. As of October 19, 2009 when 101138096 elected to take the collateral as satisfaction of the debt the only party to whom notice was required was the debtor Giants Head and his notice is in compliance with s. 61(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act. When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009. The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof. Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment to the respondent 101138096 free and clear of the claim of the applicant.","FIAT: This is an application by Inland for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993.

The parties had executed a separation agreement in 1991 which agreed to joint custody of the children and in the event both children were living with one of the parties that the non-custodial parent pay maintenance of $175 per month per child to the 'custody' parent. This agreement was confirmed in September 1992. At the time of the agreement, the husband earned $48,000 and by 1993 the first year in which he was required to pay a total of $4,200 his income was only 42% of his 1992 income. However, he actually paid little in excess of his required payment that year and paid substantially more than his original obligation."
b_1996canlii6818.txt,"At issue was the determination of the quantum of spousal and child support and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The respondent's supplementary allowances were taken into consideration in finding a gross salary of $53,000.00 per annum. Due to an injury he was no longer able to work overtime but was working full-time. Should a medical discharge become necessary an application to vary can be brought at that time. 2)The petitioner suffered a substantial economic disadvantage. The frequent moves due to the husband's employment had disrupted the petitioner's employment and university education. However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse. 3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. Shares in joint names were divided equally. Other assets were divided equally. 4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits. The fair solution was to use the enhanced value of the 'With Survivorship Benefits' column and the date of adjudication was used as the valuation date. The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner. 5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income. $600.00 per month per child was awarded.  6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse. The petitioner's future plans were realistic. $800 per month until June 1, 2001 was awarded for spousal support.  7)Costs including one-half of the cost of preparing reports and pension valuations were awarded to the petitioner.","In addition to the dissolution of the marriage, the petitioner claimed custody of the children, spousal and child support, an equal division of matrimonial property and costs. HELD: 1)The parties were agreed on their divorce based on their separation in excess of 1 year and that Mary be granted custody with reasonable access to John upon reasonable notice. Although the liability of John to pay maintenance for the children is not disputed, the parties were not able to agree on the quantum thereof, which required determination of John's income. 2)The respondent was to pay $600 per month per child for support for the duration of 15 years. This amount was to be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Guidelines based on John's gross yearly income as determined by the Court. The $400 per month spousals should be divided equally when and if anything is realized on the shares. 3)The reasonable and realistic figure to use for the determination of maintenance was a gross salary of $53,000 per annum. If indeed Mary did receive the greater share, it was of no great significance and it could be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage."

3_1999canlii12362.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction of sexual assault causing bodily harm on the ground the trial judge erred in preventing cross-examination of the complainant. The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother. The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter. The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her. The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment. The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person. The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history. HELD: Appeal allowed. The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex. The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. That evidence could have placed in doubt the reliability of the complainant's identification of the person who assaulted her since the room was dark when the assault was alleged to have occurred. The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant in respect of the same assault is obvious. That question has a direct bearing on her credibility.",The appellant was found guilty of having sexually assaulted the complainant contrary to s. 272(c) of the Criminal Code. He appealed the conviction on the ground that the trial judge erroneously interpreted s. 276 of the Code to prevent proper cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered.  1)The trial judge failed to consider that the complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather about a previous complaint of a sexual assault which was understood to have been made about another man. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complaintant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. 2)The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint in respect of the same assault was obvious. It does not raise the issue of whether the complainant has 'engaged in sexual activity'. That question had a direct bearing on her credibility.  3)The appellant had been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence.

The appeal was dismissed as the substance of the appeal did not restrict the benefits to an effective date.

6_2001canlii365.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving (Criminal Code ss.255(1) and 253(a)) and with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration exceeding .08 (Criminal Code ss.253(b) and 255(1)). Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary? HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08). Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.  1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed. The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial. 4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case. In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence. It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.  5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings. Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded. 6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test. Both the subjective and objective tests were met. The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test). Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes. However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence. The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle. While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied. There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel. He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver. Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable. It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city. The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there. It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant. On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied. There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected. The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle while over.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was stopped by the RCMP at 1:40 a.m. when he observed the accused driving his vehicle 70 km per hour in a 40 km zone. Upon arriving at the RCMP detachment at 2:12 am, the officer noted a smell of liquor and blood alcohol coming from the accused. The roadside screening was performed and the accused failed the test. As result the officer made a demand for the accused's assistance in providing a breath sample. The officer stated that he preferred that someone else administer the test when he is the arresting officer and did not go to Martensville or Warman as he has found that there is rarely anyone at either location or in any case anyone who can administer test. The defence argued that it was unnecessary to burden the accused with the issue of whether or not the accused should be required to produce representative ampoules. HELD: The defence application was dismissed. 1) The accused's evidence was straightforward and reliable. There was no one reason for the failure to produce the standard alcohol solution as requested by the defence. 2) The defence had no restriction on its decision, albeit the facts concerned what the Court of Appeal described as 'live issue'. The essence of the Crown's case is the results of the analyses of the breath samples of the accused, which results are obtained from a breathalyzer machine. It is obvious that such a machine cannot be subjected to cross-examination and that its veracity will never be in question. However, it does not follow that its accuracy is immune from attack. An integral component of any analysis is the solution contained in the ampoule. If the solution is deficient it will produce an inaccurate reading. The only way in which the defence can satisfy itself as to the suitability of the solution, rather than suppression, should be the starting point.""  3) It is necessary to discuss credibility before address the issues raised in this trial. It was necessary to decide this issue at the outset. The Crown urged the Court to hear the evidence and argued that there was no issue to determine until the Certificate of Analysis was filed and heard pertinent evidence. The Court was not satisfied with the defence's application once it was established that the accused was not subject to the burden of proof once it has been established that it has a meaningful outcome on the trial. 4) The Court found that the failure of the"
3_1991canlii4569.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault using a weapon and his sentence of eight years. The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena. The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial. He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued. The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial. The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear. He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial. Dismissing the appeal, (1) that there was nothing to show that the witness would have given relevant evidence bearing on a decisive issue in the trial and the appellant failed to meet the burden of showing that the evidence, if believed, could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial when considered with all the other evidence; counsel's decision not to call the witness where the witness was hostile and counsel did not know what he would say was not inappropriate, and, the court noted, in the circumstances, seemed to have been the right decision; (2) the excuse of failing to appear because he did not have counsel was not a legitimate excuse within the meaning of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; moreover, the appellant only raised this issue in his oral submissions and gave no notice to the Crown respecting this issue nor did he provide any supporting evidence by way of affidavit; it was seen by the Court as another unsupported and unjustified criticism of counsel and the Court concluded that the record showed that the appellant had agreed to forfeit his right to a jury trial; and (3) that an eight year sentence, although at the high end of the scale for sexual assault, was not manifestly excessive, having regard to deterrence, the circumstances of the offence, and the appellant's record which included three minor offences.","The appellant was convicted after trial of using a weapon in a sexual assault contrary to s. 246.2 of the Criminal Code. He now applies for leave to appeal against the sentence of 8 years imprisonment and a firearms prohibition order made by the trial judge.

b_1995canlii6027.txt,"The accused appealed her conviction on a charge of impaired driving. The grounds of her appeal were that the trial judge erred in determining that she was impaired, and that the trial judge otherwise misconstrued and misapplied the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Both grounds of appeal raised questions of fact. Findings of fact are not to be reversed on appeal unless it can be established that the trial judge has made some palpable and overriding error which affected her assessment of the facts. 2)The Court's task is not to retry the case or substitute its own decision. A trial judge's findings of fact can only be overturned if they are so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable. 3)The Court was unable to say that an error of that kind was made by the trial judge in this case.","The appellant appealed her 1993 conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code.

4_2009skca44.txt,"The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners. Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners. Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal. The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal. SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care. HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian. It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian. The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge found that SGI was liable in negligence on the basis that it failed to properly identify the nature and extent of the Homeowners' existing insurance coverage, which was not covered by the original policy. The Homeowners were awarded recovery against SGI equal to 50% of the judgment.  1)The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, not the broker. SGI did not publish the availability of this special insurance coverage in any of the materials distributed to its agents. It was not clear that the trial judge relied on that portion of the application form where the previous McCallum Hill policy number was stated together with the reference to the support document SF 222. The question is whether these references provided an adequate direction to the insurer about the coverage that was to be procured for the homeowners. 2)SGI is not a third party to the Contributory Negligence Act. In practice, SGI does not compare a broker to a homeowner to make sure that any changes in coverage are intentional. There is no such general duty on the insurer.  3)There are a number of legal bases on which insurance intermediaries may be found liable to insurers or customers and the nature of the duty that liability implies. In the numerous cases listed in Brown (the trial judge concluded SGI had duty, and breached it in this case, that the defendants and third party each equally contributed (50%/50%) by their negligent acts, to the loss sustained by the Draders. The defendants plead against the third party in contributory negligence. It is evident from comparing the defendants' SGI policy and the coverage applied for by Sebastian that there are number of differences in the coverage requested, culminating in a twenty per cent reduction in the premium from that charged for the McCALLUM Hill SGI Policy. The defendant was found liable for failing to apply for the insurance coverage that he received from SGI on behalf of the homeowners.  4)In this case SGI is responsible for the loss caused by the collision of the parties' crystal collection (the Swarovski crystal collection) and the loss is due to an accidental breakage, which did not constitute 'listed peril' as defined in the policy."
8_2010skqb467.txt,"Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year. This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates. In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration. The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme. The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed. While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case. While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages. It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations. It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation. The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties.","The plaintiff union represents approximately 11,000 health care workers employed by the four defendant regional health authorities. The current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) covers the period April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2012. The formal CBA was not signed until October 2010. As the CBA provides for wage adjustments going back to 2008, it requires substantial lump-sum adjustment payments for many of the employees. The plaintiffs concede that the court is without jurisdiction to determine the issue. They contend that the essential character of the issue raised concerns the terms and conditions of employment which are beyond the scope of the court. HELD: The motion to strike was dismissed. The court found that it is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendants to make the required retroactive assessment payments before the end of 2010. Neither do the plaintiffs see any reasonable prospect of a solution to the problem by making payments on a 'best approximation' of entitlement. That is a viable solution. In the long run the results of such a solution are likely to be troublesome and chaotic.

The accused also entered guilty pleas to three charges stemming from breaches of no-contact conditions with the same complainant plus two charges of obstruction of justice by attempting to dissuade the same complainant from giving evidence. The RCMP had to execute a Feeney warrant to locate the complainant in the accused basement. The Crown sought an order declaring the accused a dangerous offender. HELD: The accused was designated a dangerous offender and was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period on the conviction pursuant to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and received time served on the remaining eight charges. The evidence is conclusive that the offence for which the accused was convicted was a serious personal injury offence. The evidence was conclusive that the accused constitutes a threat to other persons because of his pattern of repetitive behaviour and persistent aggressive behaviour. The accused's First Nation would provide support for the accused but its support system is presently non-existent.

He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The court found that the accused had a pattern of repetitive behaviours showing failure to restrain his behaviour and likelihood of causing death or injury to other persons. The Crown was only required to prove that the offender exhibited a substantial degree of indifference respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences to others of his behaviour. It did not have to prove either of those things. The accused had met the onus of proving both patterns of behaviour in R. v. Lemaigre (2004), [TWLII], [2003] SCC 46. HELD: 1) The accused is a long-term offender and the Gladue factors must be considered in determining his sentence. 2) The facts of this offence leave no doubt that the Crown has proved that the indictable offence under s. 267(b) involved the use of violence against the complainant. Furthermore, this offence attracts a sentence of ten years. 3) The Court found that it could not afford to negate the'reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community' of the accused."

He claimed for pain and suffering, loss of income and loss of earning capacity. Plaintiff was found 60% responsible for injuries and defendant 40% responsible. Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks. The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury. However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door. He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously. The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path. The plaintiff suffered an injury which restricted his activities for the first five months, to a lesser extent for the following year and to a very limited extent to the time of trial. There was no evidence to support a claim for diminishment of earning capacity.","The plaintiff injured his knee when he tripped over a 'dolly-cart' while attending at the premises of the defendant.

Several of the defendants made application to have the plaintiff s solicitor removed as solicitor of record claiming this was a conflict of interest. Dismissing the application, that the test in such circumstances is whether the public represented by the reasonably informed person would be satisfied that no use of confidential information would occur. To do so it must be shown that a solicitor client relationship existed. There must not be a danger of the confidential information coming back to haunt the client. The court found that such a relationship did not exist in this instance. In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that the solicitor received information which is relevant to the matter at hand. The court found no such evidence of this possibility. It is no bar to representation by a solicitor that some former partners at a previous firm will be examined for discovery or called to testify.","Plaintiffs and employees suing the former employer for breach of contract and/or negligent or improper use of confidential information resulted in a disqualifying conflict of interest. The court applied a test to determine whether a solicitor and client relationship existed, and found that Pink Breen, the former president of the employer, breached that threshold by failing to disclose confidential information to the employer and, therefore, should not be permitted to represent the applicants in this action. Dismissing the application, that there was nothing in the prior relationship between the former President and the applicants that would have led the Court to conclude that the employer/employee relationship was not one which required disclosure. The information about the pension plan and its beneficiaries was not relevant to the present action as it was not negotiated with the applicant's client.

Another tenant in the shopping centre already operated a drug store and their lease provided that no other tenant would operate a drug store in any part of their premises. The other tenant brought an application for a interim injunction against the defendant. The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises. The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial. Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration.","The plaintiff company applied for a permanent injunction against Sobeys and a temporary injunction restraining its operations in the Shoppers Drug Mart shopping centre. The latter had a twenty-five year lease expiring in 2005 for 22,000 square feet. The lease provided that the lessee would use the premises only for the purposes of the retail sale of complete line of food products, as well as general retail merchandising, as carried on by the rest of the stores. There was no factual dispute concerning the legal formation of the lease. It was entered into effectively and it is to be enforced according to its terms. There is no suggestion, for example, of a mistake in the expression of the terms. The essential aspects of the conduct alleged to constitute breach are known and uncontraverted. The potential, and emphasize the word potential, for controversy would be evidence to be introduced of the circumstances surrounding the formation of a lease. Sobeis opposed the application for an interim injunction on the basis that the evidence did not establish grounds for a temporary injunctive relief at the required threshold, that neither the plaintiff nor the lesee had established irreparable harm. The Court would not automatically engage in a prolonged examination of the merits just because a breach of a negative covenant is alleged. There are occasions for assessing the evidence for the cause of action or defence more closely than that of an interlocutory injunction. The plaintiffs rely upon Miller v. Toews, 1990 CanLII 2615 (MB CA), [1991] W.W.R. 712 (SCA), and Canada v. LeBlanc (1991), 1 S.C.A. 179 and 4C Concerned Citizens v. Cumberland (1997), S408/26 (NSSC). Both applications were brought in chambers. HELD: The application for the permanent injunction was dismissed on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to support an application under the terms of the original lease and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs would suffer harm if the operation was carried on in the same manner as that of the other drugstore in the mall. There would be no need for a final determination as there was nothing in the evidence which would suggest there was a final remedy for the breach of those terms. In the interim, the Court would take the position taken in Manitoba and Saskatchewan on negative covenants more seriously than it would have in the North American context."
d_2000skca131.txt,"The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence of 2.5 years for manslaughter on the grounds it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of deterrence and denunciation. HELD: A sentence of 5 years of imprisonment was imposed. The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent. The accused pled guilty, had no criminal record, did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victim who died from the wounds or of the other victim; she intervened to stop the beating although only after being satisfied the alleged the drug dealer had nothing to give the robbers.  The accused appeared to be doing well in the prison programs. The sentence of the co-accused who had a record of 40 previous convictions had been increased to the equivalent of more than 10 years imprisonment.","The 18 year old, who had pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter in respect of the death of Milan Kulas, was sentenced to 2½ years imprisonment. The Crown appealed the sentence, alleging a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence was set aside and a sentence of five years imprisonment was imposed in lieu of 5 years. The following factors mandate a lesser sentence: 1) the sentence imposed by the trial judge did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that the sentence be proportionate to the gravity of the offence, nor did the sentence achieve the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. 2) the respondent had no criminal record; she did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the two men and intervened to stop the beating of the first one, albeit only after she seemed satisfied that he had nothing to give the robbers; and she seemed to be doing well in all programs in prison."
5_2010nspc18.txt,"The on-site supervisor was convicted of two offences under the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations (failing to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter of the work area and failing to ensure that an intermediate or 'mid' guardrail was installed) after a mason was killed when he fell from scaffolding on the job site. Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell. The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew. In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations. The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard. Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall.","The defendant was found guilty of two counts of failing to comply with the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations. The defendant had been working on a work platform supported by scaffolding that was approximately 13 feet above the concrete sidewalk. As he stepped out and reached to secure his block or level line, he placed one foot on the open edge of a false ceiling suspended by wires under the roof overhang. When he placed his weight on that false ceiling, it gave way and the defendant fell off the work platform. He suffered serious injuries and was hospitalized for a short time. In assessing the appropriate sentence, the court had to take into account the defendant's own actions, his errors in judgment regarding the interpretation of the legislation relating to the top-rail and his failure to properly supervise and install the guardrails prior to work commenced in that area. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislative safety measures. Rather, it was an issue of moral blameworthiness, which was reflected in the actions of the defendant."
b_2018skca65.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial. Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial. It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge's refusal to grant an adjournment deprived the accused of his right to make full answer and defence and to fair trial. It also found that, in the course of the trial, the accused's counsel had justifiably withdrawn, leaving him to conduct his own defence. The issues in this appeal were whether the judge's decision was based on reasons not wellfounded in law and whether the decision affected the accused’s right to a fair trial or to a presumption that the accused was premeditated to delay the trial."
5_2005nssc172.txt,"The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children. Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard. The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency. Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders. Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed. Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling","The applicants applied for leave to terminate an order for permanent care and custody respecting their three children. The applicants had been fighting an old war, blaming the Agency for their past. They had taken parenting courses, marriage counselling and parenting counselling, and had placed the children in different adoptive homes because notices of proposed adoption had been given. Counsel for the applicants indicated that they intended to proceed with the application for leave rather than the application to terminate. They opposed the leave application on the basis that the applicants had allowed matters to escalate with the Agency and that they had supported the applicants' aggression against the agency in order to avoid an outburst with the children. HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the evidence presented was not sufficient to justify granting leave to apply to terminate the order for the permanent care or to make a change in the children's lives. The children were placed in one home for adoption, and their parenting was abysmal. The parents had completed 35 sessions of anger management management training, which was not available through Family Services. The mother had completed nine parenting courses and had made significant improvements in the cleanliness of their home, including taking parenting courses. Although other parenting services were available, they were unlikely to benefit them sufficiently and the mother had not completed the program herself."

The defendant did not file affidavit evidence but opposed the application solely on the basis that recent amendments to the Queen's Bench Act precludes reference to minutes of settlement. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to enter judgment for $15,000 plus costs of this application. A settlement agreement reduced to writing in no way offends the confidentiality required under s.28.1. The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to them in his affidavit. Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to this situation. If a party to an action is unable to enforce a concluded settlement, the pre-trial process becomes meaningless. The legislation never intended such a result. There was no suggestion that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settlement. Nor was it suggested the minutes were unclear or ambiguous. The defendant did not allege the settlement was amended or altered or that the balance of $15,000 does not remain owing.","The plaintiff applied for summary judgment pursuant to Queen's Bench Act rules 184A(1)(a) and s. 29 in accordance with minutes of settlement agreed to by the parties following a pre-trial conference. The defendant argued that the majority of the plaintiff's affidavit must be struck by reason of the fact that the averments contravene s. 28.1 of the Queen’s Bench Act, 1998. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The defendant was to pay $20,000 plus costs taxed to the date of the Minutes of Settlement. 2)The plaintiff did receive the first installment of $5,000 from the defendant. The remaining $15,000 was not paid to him nor had it been paid to his lawyer. 3)There was no suggestion that the settlement was amended or altered at that time. Nor did he suggest that the balance of money did not remain owing. 4)The enforceability of the settlement agreement can be determined by reading and interpreting its terms.  The defendant opposed the application solely on the basis that the plaintiff opposes the application.  5)Settlements of actions are encouraged in our courts for a great many years and it appears to me that the courts should be hesitant in upsetting or rectifying minutes of settlements unless of course there be something in the nature of fraud, incapacity of a party or the minutes are too vague to enforce or are obviously incomplete. There is no suggestion by the defendant that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settling.

c_2003skqb46.txt,"The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA. The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949. The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19. A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application. HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck. The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively. The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c). The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. 3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada). Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial. 4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii). As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct. 5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada. 6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate. The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2). Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24. 7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate. SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.  LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b).","The Attorney General applies to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that they are barred by certain statutes, or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The plaintiff claims that he was physically assaulted and that he lost his traditional language and culture approximately 50 years ago, when he was attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School near Lebret, Saskatchewan (the 'Residential School'). The Attorney General acknowledges that Sister Elle was employed at the Residential School from 1944 until her death in 1993. HELD: 1) The limitation period in the POPA is set aside by s. 3(3.2) of the LAA for actions which fall within the scope of s3(3).1 Of the various types of torts, the only one exempt from the limitation period is the one described in [R.J.G.] v. Canada (Attorney General), [2001] 1 S. 3.1, as amended. 2) Pursuant to s. 2(1)(d)(i) the Act, the 12 month time limitation period for actions arising from the conduct of two deceased employees of the residential school is 6 years. 3) In this case the plaintiffs claim that they were physically assaulted while they were in a relationship of dependency with the perpetrators of the 1953 assaults. There is no agreement as to when that alleged injury or damage ceased. That is a factual matter to be dealt with at trial.  4) The plaintiffs purport to bring this action against the Crown pursuant to the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act and against the other defendants as Crown agents, but only if the negligence occurred 'on public work'. Even if the time limitation time in s. 1(3) applies to claims of negligence, breach of trust, and breach of fiduciary duty the plaintiff alleges continuing injury and damage. That limitation period explicitly begins to run '... from the discovery of the causeof action'.  5) Although the Attorney General's submissions on the first two grounds were rejected the Court had no jurisdiction to hear or adjudicate upon the action concerning the death of Helen Greyeyes, the Court held that the same argument was rejected in [P.G.'s v. Attorney General, [2003] 2 SJS."
c_1996canlii6986.txt,"A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division. The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'. The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500. At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach. The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law. None were found in either case. The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.  2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format. The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case. 3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified. Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct. The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee. They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act. If the legislature had intended the statutorily mandated costs to be costs in the cause it would have said so. LEADS should bear the costs in this case. In any event pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s52 of the Act the costs of providing the materials were to be borne by the respondent. 5)Subject to the above the respondent was entitled to costs of and incidental to the appeal.ADDENDUM to TWL QB96220. The concluding paragraph was amended to read: Subject to what has been stated in the immediately preceding paragraph hereof, the respondent will be entitled to recover its costs of, and incidental to this appeal, from the appellant, to be taxed on Column 3.","This was an appeal pursuant to s. 51 of The League of Educational Administrators, Directors and Superintendents Act from the decisions of the Discipline Committee, and the Executive Committee, of the League which found the appellant guilty of professional misconduct. The Discipline Committee found that the appellant had misrepresented the report of the principal of a school division, and recommended that he be transferred. The discipline committee recommended that reprimand be imposed. The appellant received a reprimand and a fine of $2,500. Both parties submitted briefs of law in support of their positions. In issue was whether the findings of fact were true or unprofessional conduct as set forth in the grounds of s. 2 and s. 5 of the notice of appeal and whether the discipline committee erred in its application of the burden of proof. HELD: 1)The discipline committee's finding of credibility was supported by the admissible evidence. 2)It did not err in its finding that the conduct of the appellant was sufficiently serious to constitute professional misconduct under the Rules of Practice and Procedure of this Court. 3)The Discipline Committee's determination was based upon the direct evidence of the witnesses testifying and the exhibits as filed by the parties. 4)If the facts were in fact true, the appellant's misrepresentation of the report constituted professional misconduct and the imposition of a fine by the executive committee of LEADS for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. 5)Reasons for the discipline panel's failure to apply the standard of proof prescribed by the Code of Conduct of the Association of Physicians and Surgeons were examined."
3_1996canlii4959.txt,"The Crown appealed two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently for armed robbery. The 32 year old appellant had 32 previous convictions including two armed robberies and seven convictions relating to possession of weapons. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed and the sentence for each offence was increased to three years imprisonment to be served concurrently. 1)The judge made an error in calculating the time on remand that should have been credited to the sentence. Only six months rather than the whole year should have been counted. 2)Given the appellant's record these offences demanded more than the three year minimum generally imposed.","This was a Crown appeal against two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently. The sentences were imposed in respect of two convictions for armed robbery. The respondent agreed that the facts of the case were accurately set out in the Crown factum. He negotiated a sale of hash oil to be supplied by the complainant, who was angry that he had been ripped off and returned to confront the respondent. At that point the respondent pulled a knife and threatened the complainant. Eventually the respondent found the money underneath the complainant's bed and took it, taking the money with him. The appellant was 32 years old and had 32 previous convictions including two armed robberies and seven other convictions relating to possession of weapons. He was on parole for his conviction of 1992 for robbery, his parole was revoked, his service ended in 1995 and he was held on Remand until the date of sentencing in September 1995. HELD: Appeal allowed. Two years less one day concurrent on each charge is 1 year less 1 day concurrent than the three year minimum generally imposed for such offences. Taking all of the factors into account, and even allowing some discount for the fact that the robbery occurred during the course of an illegal drug transaction, the sentences for each offence should be increased to three years imprisonment, the sentence to be set concurrently."
c_2012nssc46.txt,"The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered. As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates. The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays. While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot. The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion. The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief. The motion was heard over approximately one-half day. Motion granted. The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs. The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process. It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike. The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to. Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response. Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism.","The defendant filed a motion to dismiss discovery subpoenas issued to its witnesses. The motion was allowed and the order granted included a direction as to the manner of discovery. The defendant argued the issuance was inappropriate and in non-compliance with the Civil Procedure Rules. The plaintiff sought an award of costs on a solicitor/client basis against the defendant, arguing the issuance of the subpoenas was an abuse of process. The parties had agreed to a number of conditions, including that the defendant's representative be excluded from the discovery hearing and that there would be no communication between the plaintiff's witnesses and their solicitor. Further, the defendant argued that it had no control over the order in which the parties would be discovered, as there was no evidence presented which warranted special consideration as to credibility issues as compared to other cases or situations. HELD: The Court held that party/party costs should be increased as a result of two factors: 1) the defendant took no position on exclusion of witnesses, as that was not what it was seeking; and 2) there was a lack of certainty regarding the application of Civil Procedure Rule 18.16 in terms of which witnesses will be examined. Both parties agreed initially that Rule 17.16 was applicable. Rule 77.03 (2) was applicable and the prevailing practice is different (in the view of the Plaintiff's counsel) than what was suggested by the Defendant's counsel. The particular characterizations, were made honestly and in good faith. In the end the plaintiff leaves it to the court's judgment whether to comment further on the specifics of these allegations or to issue an award to party/client costs in a limited amount."
4_2016skqb136.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage. They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children. The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner. The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend. The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again. In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order. At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order. A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially. The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014. In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent. They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends. The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him. HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial. In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012. The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.","Three days after the parties separated, the petitioner filed an application for interim orders dealing with, but not limited to, the parenting of the children and the division of family property. The application lacked a claim under the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, (2d Supp) and the Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: 1) The application was cast as a request for restraining order under s. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and (f) that an order substituting a completely different parenting regime for the children would be in effect. 2) The Court would not grant an order of the kind sought by the petitioner. The respondent has not brought a formal application to change the previous interim order. Given the short notice, the Court had little opportunity to do so. One option would be to adjourn the application to enable that to be done. However, this application is not intended to fetter a different conclusion based on evidence that may be available at trial."

The accused appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the arrest was not random and was not made in good faith and was a deliberate breach of the accused's rights under s. 9 of the Charter.

Although the trial judge concluded the appellant rebutted the presumption in s.258(1)(where it is proven that an accused occupies the seat normally occupied by the operator of the vehicle, it is presumed he is in care and control unless he can establish that he did not occupy the seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion), the appellant was found to be in de facto control. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It was clear from the trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the two paramedics who had noted the car parked in an unusual place and police officer who came along later, that he rejected the theory advanced by the appellant's counsel. The location of the ignition key was not relevant. The appellant's memory of the events was far from clear given the level of his intoxication. The trial judge was entitled to accept and rely on the evidence of the Crown witnesses.","The accused was convicted of having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol content exceeded.08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)It was clear from the learned trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the ambulance attendants and that of the police officer who came along later that he rejected the theory the appellant's counsel advanced which was that the location of the ignition key was not relevant, given the fact it was located somewhere on the right side of the steering wheel. The accused had much different story. For example, he thought the vehicle was running when he woke up but the learned judge, even though he appreciated the candid evidence he gave, clearly understood that the accused's memory of the events was far from clear given the level of his intoxication. The learned judge was entitled to accept and rely on the testimony of the EMS attendants and police officer over the accused’s version of what took place. 2)The Court found that the trial judge had properly dealt with the question of whether the accused, who initially entered his vehicle for the purpose of driving, did, in fact, abandon that purpose, was subsequently found behind the wheel of the vehicle. Accordingly, the accused was found guilty of count two of the Information."
c_2009skca53.txt,"The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition. On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts. They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party. The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences. The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature. The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders. The Court found the sentences must be set aside. The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment. HELD: The total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served.","The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition; and conspiring together and with others to traffick in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) for being a member of the criminal organization. The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of the offences, particularly in light of the volume of trafficking and lengthy period of time over which it had taken place, the highly dangerous nature of the substances sold, which included crack cocaine, the fact that they were working for acriminal organization and their motivation was financial gain. HELD: The sentences imposed were 30 months, 5 months having already been served. The total sentence in each case is 30 months in the community, 5 month having already be served. 1) The respondents all worked 12 hours a day and rotated their shifts so that the “deal” phone and delivery car were being operated 24 hours per day, seven days per week. This was a high volume of sales made possible by practices defined by the organization and established to ensure delivery of cocaine on a 24 hour day basis while reducing the risk of discovery. It was clear that if the sentence imposed for the predicate offence was reduced to take into account the mandatory consecutive penalty for the aggravating offence, the effect would have been to frustrate the will of parliament through the failure to recognize and impose the mandatory minimum penalty for aggravating"
d_1995canlii5746.txt,"When Davidson, Sr. sold his farm to his son he retained the right to continue receiving the rentals arising from four surface leases which he had previously granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells. The son granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff which was exercised and a fee simple title was issued in 1973 subject to encumbrances including caveats protecting the surface leases. There was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose from the option agreement were merged in the transfer and effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a new unencumbered title. HELD: Declaration denied. Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs. 1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.  2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him. His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego. This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years.","The plaintiff was granted an option to purchase land from the defendants. The option was exercised and a fee simple title was issued to him. The title was encumbered by, inter alia, caveats protecting the surface leases but there was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The land fell into the family of which the plaintiff was son, one who needed to expand his farming operation. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)It is repugnant that the court be called upon tovest in an interest which has heretofore been freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 2)The plaintiff has been at the risk of being sued by the defendants because of the provisions of the Option Act which prevent the issuance of a new, and for this purpose, unencumbered title. 3)In any event, it was never intended that a registered owner, merely by exhibiting a certificate of title, should be able to escape the performance of contracts he has entered into prior to, contemporaneously with or subsequent to the registration of his interest, or to deny trusteeship which he has created or one which may be fastened upon him by law. 4)The option agreement was merged in the transfer and issued to the plaintiff in 1973. No reference was made to the rental charge which had been previously reserved. 5)In this case the plaintiff had been denied his right to continue receiving rentals arising from four surface leases which he had previously granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells. The defendants continued to insist that the plaintiff receive his fair share of the revenue from these rentals. The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose fromthe option agreement were merged andeffectively disappeared upon their registration. 6)The options were not being transferred to the Optionee but were reserved by the predecessor in title the Optionor of the Second Part and the covenants and agreed to enter into separate agreement with the Executors of the estate of Thomas Davidson, Jr. with reference to their reservation of such surface leases. 7)It was apparent in this case that there had been no intention that therent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue in the hands of its holders for a period of about 15 years.  8)On its face it appears that the section has the effect of enabling a purchaser to take advantage of the owner of known but unregistered interest in land even in the face of contrary contractual obligation as between the purchaser"
d_1995canlii3966.txt,The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of assaulting his 8 year old stepdaughter by slapping her and striking her with a small paddle. The Crown and counsel for the accused agreed that a fine and probation would be appropriate. The trial judge sentenced him to 1 year in prison and 1 year's probation. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The force applied was minimal and the child was not injured physically. 2)The sentence imposed would result in the accused losing his employment which would harm his dependents. 3)The Court reduced his sentence to 60 days intermittent.,The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge of assaulting an eight year stepdaughter. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment and one year's probation. The Crown and the defence agreed that it was probably an instance where a fine and probation order would create the necessary special deterrence and parental guidance the situation called for. The trial judge was however of the view that the conduct of the accused warranted a more severe penalty. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a sentence of 60 days intermittent incarceration was substituted for the sentence of 1 year. The probation order was to remain unchanged except to substitute the word 'approved' for'supervised' in the first condition.
6_1997canlii9876.txt,"The respondent was hired as an account manager by the appellant. She did not reach her planned sales goals during her employment, and became depressed. She took six weeks off work on the advice of her doctor. When she returned from sick leave she was dismissed by the appellant, who had already decided to terminate her employment after concluding that she was not able to handle the job. She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed. The jury awarded the respondent $20,000 in lieu of notice and $60,000 damages for mental distress. The appellant appealed the award for mental distress. Per Hallett, J.A., Roscoe, J.A., concurring, allowing the appeal, that the suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without notice. Per Freeman, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that a degree of mental distress is always likely to accompany the termination of employment. However, when the employer's conduct aggravates the mental distress beyond the degree which can be remedied by agreement or reasonable notice, a right to further damages arises.","The appellant sold computer systems including hardware and software to hospitals and other health care facilities. The respondent was hired as account manager with a sales territory consisting of the four Atlantic provinces. She was expected to take three or four years to develop the territory. Her responsibilities included making sales contacts, co-ordinating the activities of the specialists within the company who had to design and build the system required by the customer. The sales compensation plan provided for a four percent commission on software licenses and the net margin on hardware sales plus a scheme of cash bonuses for exceeding revenue targets which were not stated in her employment contract. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The jury found that the respondent was entitled to six months' notice. 2)It found that mental suffering would not have been in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was entered into as flowing from the appellant's unjust dismissal. 3)The trial judge correctly identified two grounds for awarding damages for mental distress: 1)He should not have permitted the issue of mental distress to go to the jury and he mischarged the jury on the question of foreseeability. The issue in assessing damages was not whether the plaintiff got what he bargained for. It was whether he should be compensated for damage the respondent should reasonably have anticipated that he would suffer as result of the dismissal. 4)The court rejected the idea that aggravated damages should be awarded in wrongful dismissal cases, particularly where the acts complained of were non-negotiable. The conduct of the appellant prior to his dismissal did not contribute to the suffering experienced by the respondent."
e_1999skqb268.txt,"The defendant manufactured solarium in Saskatoon which it sold to the plaintiffs in Minnesota. The plaintiffs alleged the solarium was defective, sued and obtained judgment in the Minnesota Court which it now sought to enforce in Saskatchewan. The defendant argued the Minnesota court did not have jurisdiction because at the time the action was commenced he was not 'ordinarily resident' in the state of Minnesota. The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the claim but did not appear or defend the action or surrender to its jurisdiction. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The defences available to defendant in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce foreign judgment are set out in s.6 of the Foreign Judgments Act. 2)While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion the defendant was ordinarily resident there. The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address. It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state. The Foreign Judgments Act reflects real difference in the meaning of 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'.","The plaintiffs sought to enforce payment by the defendant of judgment for $23,396.03 in US currency awarded to them by Carver County District Court in the First Judicial District of Minnesota. The action was defended on the basis that the defendant was not ordinarily resident in the state of Minnesota and did not appear before the Minnesota court or submit to its jurisdiction. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs to be taxed.  1)The Court in Minnesota did not have jurisdiction over the defendant because at the time the action was commenced the defendant had made use of United States postal facilities and had to comply with postal regulations which required an address in the United States. In order to comply the defendant arranged for an address at 701-4th Avenue South in the City of Minneapolis. An address of this nature could be understood as connoting either residential or business address. But because of the activities of the defendant in Minnesota, that is to say, its activities in sales, the logical conclusion that it is a business address, the court found. 2)The case law have reviewed convinces me there is a real difference in the meaning of these terms and that the Act reflects that difference. While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the plaintiff was carrying on business in Minnesota that same evidence does not support the conclusion. 3)Saskatchewan was not the only province where the word 'ordinarily resident' used in the Foreign Judgments Act. It was not suggested that subsections 3(a) and (b) had application in Saskatchewan where an action was brought to enforce a foreign judgment. The Act reflects this difference.  4)The plaintiff was served in Saskatoon with notice of the plaintiff's claim but failed to appear and defend the action or in any way submit to the jurisdiction of the Minnesota Court."
4_2000canlii3136.txt,"In a trial of liability only, jury found defendants to be entirely responsible for causing motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff was found contributorily negligent and liability was apportioned 57.5% to defendant and 42.5% to plaintiff. Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages. Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied. Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount. The greater the certainty of the final outcome of liability and the greater the strength of the evidence supporting the damages claim, the higher the proportion of damages that will be advanced. There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment. Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition. In such circumstances, a substantial sum could be ordered. Neither pre-judgment interest nor costs are to be considered by the court in such an application. The evidence in support of the spouse's application was far too incomplete and had yet to be tested by defendants in discovery. Court could not form opinion on what damages spouse was likely to recover.","The plaintiff was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident and brought an action for the recovery of damages from his employer. The issues of liability and damages were severed when a civil jury trial was held in 2000. The plaintiff sought to recover from the defendants 57½% of the damages to be assessed, an amount which was not yet been determined by the defendants in further pre-hearing procedures. The defendants offered the services of rehabilitation specialist to the plaintiff in the amount of $168,000. This was predicated on the plaintiff's counsel's projection that his damages would likely be assessed in the final analysis at something in excess of one million dollars (less 42½% for contributory negligence). The plaintiff's actuarial report quantifies the past loss of income at approximately $216,000 using a valuation date of June 1, 2000. This head of damage has a much higher degree of certainty of recovery, subject to any arguments of mitigation which the defendants might develop. The evidence to support the validity of this claim was far from complete at this stage and the defendants had offered the rehabilitation specialist a sum of $20,000, which was incorporated into the order accordingly. The claim for loss of future earnings on behalf of the plaintiff did not yet even form part of the pleadings."

On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction. The appellant pled not guilty. Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction. Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began. Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.  1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2). 2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods. The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft. Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly. There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.  3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge. However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines. If the transcript is not available, this Court may be reconvened to address the applicability of s.687 and whether it would be appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh.","An appeal from conviction on a charge of theft where the value of what was alleged to have been stolen did not exceed $5,000 and the Crown may in accordance with s. 334 of the Criminal Code proceed on indictment or by summary conviction. The substantive distinction in the proceedings is limited to the range of sentencing upon conviction. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was set aside. 1)There was nothing in the decision that convinces the Court that the trial judge in Colonsay misconstrued or misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The only reasonable inference that can draw is that the stolen that the accused stole the generator. 2)The conviction was properly supported by the evidence. The fact that the respondent was an employee of SaskPower does not necessarily make the conviction unreasonable. However, if recent possession is not relied upon as the sole evidence connecting the accused with the crime, then possession should be considered as circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly.  3)The trial judge did not err in his considerations as to whether one person could lift the generator onto a truck without assistance or whether it was too cumbersome and awkward."

They were not habitually resident in Saskatchewan and had been here only 3 months. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. The uncontradicted evidence that the mother never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home was accepted. The Court would have declined to exercise jurisdiction in any event pursuant to s.16 since it was more appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised in BC. The father was directed to forthwith file an undertaking to not disturb the status quo until court authorization has been obtained.","The petitioner sought interim custody, or primary residence of the children, pursuant to s. 6 of The Children's Law Act, 1997. The respondent sought a declaration declining jurisdiction or an order of joint custody pursuant to the Act. The children had been resident in Saskatchewan for approximately 3 months, during which time they moved on two occasions. The petitioner gave no notice to the respondent of the intended move and he returned home without any warning or note. The house was in disarray and he feared that robbery had occurred and that his wife and children were injured or abducted. HELD: 1)The children were habitually resident here. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. The substantial evidence concerning their best interests was available in British Columbia. 2)The mother had always resided in the matrimonial home with the intention that she would return to it and resume cohabitation with the respondent. She left quickly and secretly to prevent him from taking any court proceedings in British Columbia to stop her move. 3)The father had delayed in bringing an application for custody in BC because of his mistaken belief that the petitioner was considering reconciliation. Although he learned when he received her affidavit in support of her custody application that she never had any intention to return to the home, the evidence led to the conclusion that the father did not impliedly consent, or acquiesce, to the children living with them in Regina."

Before filing a defence the appellants demanded particulars of the alleged lost profits. The plaintiff refused to provide particulars and the chambers judge dismissed the appellants' application for an order compelling particulars. ,appeal dismissed; the appellants had not challenged the sufficiency of the pleadings; no case was made out that the appellants required the particulars in order to file a proper defence to the action.  There were other rules available to the appellants which could be utilized to discover the underlying details of the damage claim.","This was an interlocutory decision dismissing the appellants' demand for particulars of general damages. The matter came on for a hearing before a Chambers judge for an order compelling a substantive response to the demand. The judge dismissed the application for further particulars of the general damage claim, dismissing the application. When particulars are demanded before a Defence has been filed, such are generally not ordered unless necessary to enable the defendant to plead. Here the court was not persuaded that either is the case. The appeal was dismissed with costs to the respondent of $1500 inclusive of disbursements. The Chambers judge erred at law in ruling that particulars of damages need only be pleaded where the demand is liquidated. An expectation claim which depends upon variable factors (here, factors such as the state of the economy, price of sand, the cost of excavation) need not be particularized in the pleadings."
d_2000nsca117.txt,"Liability was admitted for a very mild rear end collision. The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health. It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem. The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000. The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment. Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs. Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages.","The respondent admitted liability for driving his truck into the back of the appellant's motor vehicle. The trial judge described the accident as a very mild rear end collision. The appellant cross appeals claiming that the trial judge's award of $25,000, as general damages, is excessive and should be reduced. The appeal and cross appeal both dismissed with costs. Both appeals and cross appeals are dismissed. While recognizing the particular pain and anxiety which the respondent was found to have caused to the appellant and at the same time, recognizing that a pre-existing condition was the major cause of his present medical problems, the trial court assessed the respondent's evidence to be lacking in credibility. The medical evidence, she determined, did not support the appellant’s position that there was no other reason for his current medical problems but the accident in question. No such reasons are advanced by the appellant."

The former registered representative of TFPG was terminated for selling unapproved investments in breach of a Shareholder Advisor Agreement which permitted the sale of TFPG's financial products and services only. TFPG sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the respondent to return all materials and files respecting TFPG's clients, to cease any contact with its clients, and to make no attempt to solicit any current or prospective client. HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG. The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services. 1)It was agreed that the respondent should return all of TFPG's files and materials with a right to make and keep a copy.  2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration. It was not unconscionable nor against public policy. The respondent had warranted that he had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the agreement. The applicant met the test for injunctive relief but the relief as set out in the draft order was too restrictive and denied others freedom of choice as to which party they wished to deal with. 4)A contractual right to injunctive relief is only one factor. The applicant must establish that the right to interlocutory injunction is clear; there is a serious question to be tried and a strong prima facie case; that irreparable harm will result; if there is a doubt as to whether there is an adequate remedy in damages there must be a determination, on a balance of convenience, which party is likely to suffer a greater harm.","FIAT. The plaintiff sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the defendant to deliver all files, documents, records, plans, software or other TFPG related material respecting clients of the plaintiff. The defendant had entered into a Shareholder Advisor Agreement with the plaintiff whereby the respondent agreed he would sell and represent only the applicant's financial products and services which the applicant approved. In exchange for this the respondent received commissions from the applicant. It is alleged the respondent sold unapproved investments of competitor and as result he was terminated pursuant to the agreement. As well, the applicant claims the respondent has and continues to breach the 'non-solicitation' clause in the agreement by carrying on the same business on his own. That part of the order may issue. HELD: In order to succeed the applicant must also satisfy the Court (1) that the right to an interlocutory injunction is clear; (2) that there is a serious question to be tried and there is strong prima facie case; (3) that irreparable harm will result in the absence of the injunction; and (4) if there is doubt as to the possibility of an adequate remedy in damages, there must be a determination as to which party, on a balance of convenience, is likely to suffer greater harm from the granting or refusal of injunctive relief. In the circumstances, the parties' agreement may give to a decree of specific enforcement an effect that had not been anticipated and might be oppressive and consequently the court, which has to make and enforce the order, can never relinquish ultimate control of it and responsibility for it."
b_2011nssc75.txt,"After a piece of family property was divided into two parcels, one of the brothers continued to use a driveway and maintain a garden on the other parcel. When this brother died, his son continued to use the driveway and garden, even after the second property changed hands many times. When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription. He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission. Judgment for the defendants; there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway. Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission.","Roy Longard, the plaintiff, wants to continue to garden on the Keel property and use the Borden driveway. By this action he claims that he has the right to do both. HELD: 1) On the basis of the Statutory Declaration and on the totality of the evidence that the Longard brothers divided the land and each occupied their respective lots, they both knew that they were using the driveway and the garden with their consent and that the property belonged to them. It would seem that if it were a right-of-way as significant as the driveway running proximate to their residence and accessing the defendant's property, it would have been referenced in these subsequent deeds. There was no expressed reservation shown by the plaintiff as to its use by the defendants. 2) The plaintiff has not shown that the reservation contained in the 1942 Eldard deed to Borden (the defendant's brother) is or incorporates the driveway. It is not shown in the documents that either party has expressed a reservation. The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. 3) This permission extended by Borden to Eldard and then to Roy precludes the creation of any right to cross the Bordens driveway created by a prescription or lost grant. If the plaintiff has access to the original driveway, it has a right to it as long as it remains blocked off by the Defendants. Having found the cause of the problems identified and the reasons for the delay in bringing this matter to Court, it is not necessary to resolve the issue of costs. 4) There is considerable and convincing evidence that Eldred and Roy Longard in combination used a long-distance road in a continuous, uninterrupted, open and peaceful manner for many years (well in excess of 20 years) prior to it being blocked off. This road is not an existing road. The road was in use in 1942. The defendant's understanding is insightful he had used this entrance but he knew he didn't have a right of way over it and so made arrangements with his brother to obtain right to use it. The other driveway is shown on a plan of survey that was created August 11, 1980 and entitled ""Plan of Survey showing the lands of Eldrid and Borden"". It is the other driveway""."
7_2014skpc84.txt,"Criminal Law – Strict LiabilityStatutes – Interpretation – Traffic Safety Act, Section 203(1)Traffic Safety Act – Motor Vehicle Offences – Passing Highway Workers or Equipment The accused was charged with an offence contrary to s. 203(1) of The Traffic Safety Act, driving over 60 km/h passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone. The accused was charged as the owner of the vehicle, not necessarily the driver. The offence was the result of a speed monitoring camera and the Act allows the Crown to complete their case without calling any witnesses. The accused testified that he did not speed past any highway workers or equipment. He said that he was following a pilot vehicle when he passed the workers and equipment and only sped up after the pilot vehicle turned around when there were no more workers or equipment. The picture of the accused’s vehicle from the speed monitoring camera did not show any highway workers or equipment. HELD: The person who tested and deployed the speed monitoring camera provided affidavit evidence that the picture was taken within a marked construction area but it did not say that the accused was speeding as he was passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment. Section 203(1) specifies that there is only an offence for travelling at a speed greater than 60 km/h when passing highway workers or operating equipment. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving faster than 60 km per hour when passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone. The offence under s. 203(1) of the Traffice Safety Act is a strict liability offence and its documentary evidence proves every element of the offence. The only aspect of the Crown's case that the accused disputes is that he passed highway workers/occupation highway equipment when he was travelling faster than60 kilometres per hour. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The evidence consisted of a photograph of the offending vehicle taken by a speed monitoring camera showing the date and time the photograph was taken and the speed of the vehicle when the camera was taken, which in this case was 84 kms/hr. The affidavit of Bradley Christensen, the person who tested, deployed, and operated the speed monitoring device, and affidavits of service confirming service of the Summary Offence Notice, the photograph, and the SGI Motor Vehicle Division certified search.

d_2003nssc223.txt,"The testator had prepared his own Will on a pre-printed form and left his assets to his children, whom he then proceeded to name. One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will. the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it. The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention. Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception. In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given. The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will.","This was an application for the interpretation of the Last Will and Testament of the testator and specifically to determine the entitlement of the Estate of Jane Mitchell under the Will pursuant to s. 31 of the Wills Act. The testator left all of his real and personal estate to his children and grandchildren, except for jewellry and personal clothing. His will was prepared on a pre-printed stationer's form with handwritten portions indicating the disposition of his assets. It appears that from time to time he made attempts to make changes in his will, but these were not properly executed and witnessed. Counsel have urged the Court to find that Clause 11 does describe a contrary intention. In this case, the gift of Jane's estate was entitled to her share just as if she had died 'immediately after' her father."
2_1999canlii12398.txt,"The parties were involved in an accident. The defendant stopped at a stop sign 39 feet from the intersection and rolled forward while yielding. The plaintiff locked his brakes and skidded into the defendant, attempting to avoid an accident. Damage to both vehicles exceeded the insurance deductibles and both parties claim damages against each other for the amount of the deductibles. HELD: The plaintiff will have judgment against the defendant in the amount of $50. The defendant will have judgment against the plaintiff in the amount of $450 plus costs. Fault for this accident was attributed 10% to the defendant and 90% to the plaintiff. The defendant had indeed yielded properly but could have been more prudent in insuring that other motorist were aware that she yielded. The plaintiff should have taken more appropriate measures to avoid the accident","The plaintiff, who was travelling west on Highway 306 near Grey, Saskatchewan, saw car driven by Margaret Henry approach from his right, stop at the stop sign, and then proceed forward toward the highway, he applied his brakes with such force that his truck entered a skid, left the highway and struck the side of the car. The damages to both the truck and the car exceeded the $500 insurance deductible. The plaintiff brought an action against the car's owner, Vernon Henry, and Margaret Henry for his $500.00 deductible and counterclaim for the same. In issue was whether Henry had stopped, or was able to stop, before entering the plaintiff's right of way. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the plaintiff and the defendant, along with costs of two subpoenas. 1)Although Henry complied with the rules of the road, a prudent driver in this situation would come to a stop further back from the highway to ensure that oncoming drivers would know that they had been seen and yielded to. Henry came to a second stop before the collision occurred. That evidence was supported by two independent facts (the car's car remained off the paved portion of the highway; the vehicle's front wheel skid marks were entirely off the pavement, several feet off the driving portion. 2)It must be concluded that either Henry or she had stopped and/or was capable of stopping before entering Schmidt's rightof way. Even if Schmidt concluded that Henry was going to proceed into his path, he had more appropriate alternatives than locking his brakes and turning to the right. He could have applied his brake, maintained control of his vehicle, and moved into the oncoming lane."
b_2007skqb1.txt,"This is an appeal pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act, 1997. The appellant asserts a palpable and overriding error by the learned trial judge in accepting, and finding as fact, part of the testimony of a witness but not accepting the further testimony of the witness that an amount was also owing to the appellant by the respondent. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The trial judge was not required to accept the entirety of the witness's testimony, despite having accepted most of it, particularly in light of the contradictory evidence of the respondent denying the sum claimed by the appellant. The denial by the respondent of the appellant's claim, accepted by the trial judge, was fatal to the appellant's onus of proving a mutual understanding and absolute acknowledgement of the alleged debt between the parties.","This is an appeal, pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act, 1997. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. There is no palpable and overriding error in the judgment. The trial judge accepted part of the testimony of a witness who accepted the amount as being the correct quantum of his counterclaim. The judgment was given to the respondent for $1,685.86. The appellant argues that there was no error of law nor unreasonable finding of fact by the trial judge, and that his conclusions are not so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable. The test for assessing evidence and arriving at findings of fact is the same as that test for truth and conviction. The standard of appellate review is that of 'clearly wrong, 'unreasonable' and 'not reasonably supported by the evidence' (see H.L. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 2525); the test for proving proof of a juridic error is'simply wrong' on the face of it, but not 'utterly wrong' or'reasonable' as to making it so, despite the fact that it was accepted by most of the witnesses on the basis of their mutual acknowledgement of the alleged denial of the sum of the debt by the appellant."
d_1999canlii12581.txt,"In issue was whether the Bank breached its lending contract, its fiduciary duty or duty of confidentiality; and if so, what damages, if any, should be awarded. The defendant's bank loans fell into default after SGI disability benefits were terminated. The Bank reported the particulars of the loan defaults to a credit reporting agency (Equifax). The defendant declined to give an assignment of any accident injury settlement he might receive from SGI and requested the bank direct Equifax to eliminate any references to his default or delinquency upon the bank loans. The bank offered to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming the arrears were the result of the defendant's automobile accident and that he had undertaken to pay the bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement. The bank commenced this action for payment. The Compains sought general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages in a counterclaim for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and breach of contract. HELD: The counterclaims were dismissed with taxed costs to the bank for both the claim and counterclaims. The bank's claim was admitted at trial. 1)Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he had to confidentiality of his credit information by the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement. The principles outlined by the English Court of appeal in Tournier enumerated four exceptions to a bank's confidentiality obligation to its customers. 2)The analogy between the insurance cases and a bank and borrowing customer was not complete or appropriate. Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case. 3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business.","The plaintiff banked with the defendant, Royal Bank of Canada, and at the time of the accident the couple's mortgage loans fell into default. The Royal Bank agreed to defer commencement of any action with respect to the defaulted Bank Loans until such time as the applicant received an accident injury settlement from SGI. In the alternative, the plaintiff Bankers' counter-claimed against the Royal Bank for general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages. HELD: 1)None of the counter-claimants' claims were upheld and they were dismissed in total. The plaintiff Royal Bank will have its costs against the defendant Royal Bank in the amount of $7888. 2)There was no evidence lead to suggest that the characterization of these loans, as they appeared in the Equifax reports, were out of the normal course of business. It is fair and reasonable inference to be drawn, from all of the facts and circumstances, that persons using and relying upon the Equision statements would be familiar with the various codes and classifications used to generate the credit report.  3)The Royal Bank did not act in bad faith or in breach of its fiduciary or contractual obligation towards the applicant. It was in good faith and in keeping with its obligations to the applicant and its general banking practices including its report to Equifax as a credit reporting agency."
2_2011skpc5.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over. 08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop. The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time. The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar. The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up. The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle. The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count. The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date. The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability. The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward. The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door. The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving as shown by the Certificate of Analysis was 150 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over.08. The defence had admitted all of the essential elements of each charge; the only issue was whether or not the accused was the person operating the vehicle. HELD: The defence evidence lacked reliability. The accused was found guilty of impaired operation of a motor vehicle.  1) At the time the individuals got into the truck, Ms. Neigel was behind the wheel; the defence suggested that another individual was the driver.  2) The defence officer was adamant and unshaken on the main points of the evidence. The evidence showed that the keys were in the ignition when the police arrived at the vehicle and had been in the vehicle for approximately 1:00 a.m. Both officers were adamant and forthright in their evidence, without any attempt to fabricate or embellish. The Court found that the defence officer had a very reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt. The fact that the accused had no recollection of what had happened at the bar and was not able to recall all particulars of the night does not detract from her credibility. 3) The police officer was very evasive in cross-examination, tendency he did not exhibit in examination-in-chief. The difference between the demeanour he exhibited during his testimony and that of the accused caused the Court to have considerable concern."
b_2006skqb218.txt,"The respondent applies to vary the consent joint custody order granted in October 2004. His application was prompted by the relocation of the petitioner with one of their two children, Tyson. The sole issue on this variation application is the determination of the primary residence of Tyson. HELD: 1) The petitioner wants to move Tyson 5.5 hours away from the respondent. This also requires a change in access arrangements. These are changes in circumstances that are material.  2) The petitioner has developed a strong bond with Tyson. The respondent has developed a close relationship with the parties' other child Kailey. After Kailey went to live with the respondent, neither parent did much to facilitate the access of either child. Before the petitioner and Tyson moved, although a short distance apart, neither Kailey nor Tyson saw his or her non-custodial parent and sibling on a regular basis. Even telephone access has been sporadic. Both parents have established homes that accommodate only one child. 3) The petitioner's move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed before the petitioner's relocation. The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support. 4) Permitting the petitioner to relocate is in the best interests of Tyson. It is important that Tyson continue to live in the home of the parent whose constant presence he has become accustomed to. The petitioner has always been Tyson's primary caregiver. The petitioner is the psychological parent.",The sole issue on this variation application is determining the primary residence of Tyson. That entails deciding what is in his best interests. HELD: 1) The parties had issued a consent order in October 2004 providing for joint custody of the children with their primary residence being the home of Shauna. Shauna was the psychological parent and Tyson had always lived with her. 2) The petitioner had foreclosed the option of returning to live in the Kindersley district. It would not necessarily serve Tyson's best interests to order that Shauna be entitled to retain Tyson's primary residence only by returning to the Archerwill district. 3) The move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed prior to the relocation.  4) The only viable options at this time are to permit Shauna to relocate Tyson to Archerwill or to change the secondary residence of Rocky to allow him to have the assistance and support of someone to whom he is closely bonded. The petitioner must not be asked to assume a parenting role.

He argued that the Crown did not prove that he had distributed the copyrighted material, or that the distribution was to an extent that it prejudicially affected the owners of the copyrights. Dismissing the appeal, that by placing the copyrighted computer pro-grams on his computer bulletin board in a compressed format, for ease of transmission, and allowing access by modem to the programs, the appellant was distributing the programs to the prejudice of the owner's copyright.","This was an appeal by a young offender from convictions on three counts of distributing infringing copies of computer software contrary to s. 42(1)(c) of the Copyright Act. For the purposes of the Act, 'literary work' includes tables, compilations, translations and computer programs; 'telecommunication' means any transmission of signs, signals, writing, images or sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire, radio, visual, optical or other electromagnetic system. What the appellant did was distribute the copyrighted material by placing it in a restricted area designated as Hacker's Delight available only to persons granted special status and were not where any caller would become aware of them without J.PM's permission. It was clear that when he accessed his computer by modem from his friends' homes and downloaded the programs onto their computers, he was 'distributing' the infringing copies. Furthermore, by controlling the means and manner by which the users accessed their computer boards and providing the software to assist in the downloading by those users, the appellant was also distributing, that is giving out, or sharing the infringing copy. The evidence was that the programs were'scrambled' so that they could not be copied or downloaded by the callers, which was supported by the trial judge's critical findings. The appellant raised the following ground of appeal: 'Did the learned trial judge err in concluding that the Crown had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt?' Specifically, it is submitted the Crown did not prove that the appellant 'distributed', distributed, or distributed the copyrighted materials, or that he had the requisite knowledge, or the distribution was to an extent that it prejudicially affected the owners of the copyrights. The sentences imposed consisted of a total of 18 months probation and 150 hours of community service."

Steps were not taken to ensure that no disclosure of information would occur for a month after the firm was put on notice. At issue was whether the screening measures taken ensured that no disclosure would occur and satisfied the evidentiary burden imposed on the law firm. HELD: The solicitor and the law firm were disqualified from acting for the petitioner in the action. Because two years had lapsed further examinations were appropriate and an order issued for the petitioner to attend a further examination. If the updated information is not necessary for trial the petitioner may request costs at that time. The application for an order with respect to without prejudice offers of settlement was dismissed as matters of evidence were to be determined by the trial judge.  1)Since the decision in Martin v. Gray the Law Society amended the code of conduct to provide for rules where a member transfers from one law firm to another. 2)The difficulty in this case was that no measures were taken prior to or at the time the solicitor joined the firm to ensure confidentiality. The time period before taking appropriate steps was completely inadequate.  3)The second question, whether there was a risk that the confidential information will be used to the prejudice of the client, Martin v.

Parties are entitled to structure their legal relationships as they see fit. The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties. There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay. The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced. In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials. In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided. The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky. On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act. Husky was the user or consumer of the cement. The third parties were providing materials and services to assist in the construction of the oil well. Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts. Husky was the ultimate user and consumer of the tangible personal property. Husky is not entitled to rely on mistake of law.

HELD: 1)Section 258(7) has been judicially amended to mean 'true copy' which presumably, though not logically, means something more than 'copy'. It has grown to the point that an affidavit may be disregarded if the police do not provide supplemental evidence when challenged as to the manner in which they assured the accuracy of the copy. 2)The trial judge further advanced the law to a point where, even when not challenged, there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison in order to buttress the evidence of the affidavit. This is an error of law. A challenge under s258(7) should be based upon a discovered difference as between the copy and the original. Otherwise the refusal to admit the certificate becomes merely a prize in a procedural game which can only bring the justice system into disrepute. 3)A new trial was ordered to determine whether the stop was justified.","The accused was charged with driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and for operating a motor vehicle when his blood level exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. At trial the Crown tendered a certificate of analysis establishing that the accused was impaired by alcohol or drug, and an affidavit of service by Constable L. P.

The court held this to be an error of law. Prosecutions of this type are not infrequent and when a police officer completes the affidavit of a service his memory is fresh. As time passes between that moment and the trial of the action it is reasonable to expect his specific recollection of one particular set of copies may dim and so the affidavit must be at least as reliable as his recollection of the events some weeks or months later.

The appellant has failed to persuade us that Mr. Justice Koch erred in any material respect. In other words, we see no tenable basis for interfering with his decision.

B-3, as a result of the sheriff's return of nulla bona to the respondent's writ of execution against the debtor. [3] That left Justice Koch to consider whether to dismiss the petition pursuant to ss. 43(7) of the Act or to stay proceedings on the petition pursuant to ss. 43(11). [4] As for the first, the debtor did not satisfy Justice Koch that he was able to pay his debts or that there existed other sufficient cause to dismiss the petition. Based on the evidence adduced by the debtor, we are of the view there is no basis to conclude that Mr. Justice Koch should have been satisfied of these matters. [5] As for second, concerning ss. 43(11), we note that the subsection contains discretionary power to stay proceedings. That, of course, serves to narrow the basis for intervention on appeal. We cannot say Justice Koch erred in any requisite respect in the exercise of this discretionary power. [6] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, with costs on appeal to the respondent to be taxed in the usual way.","Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] It will not be necessary for us to hear from the respondent. The appellant has failed to persuade us that Mr. Justice Koch erred in any material respect. In other words, we see no tenable basis for interfering with his decision. [2] The debtor clearly committed an act of bankruptcy under ss.42(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act as result of the sheriff's return of nulla bona to the respondent's writ of execution against the debtor. That left Justice Koch to consider whether to dismiss the petition pursuant to s.43(7) or to stay proceedings on the petition under s. 43(11). As for the first issue, the debtor did not satisfy Justice Koch that he was able to pay his debts or that there existed other sufficient cause to dismiss. Based on the evidence adduced by the debtor, we are of the view there is no basis to conclude that the respondent should have been satisfied of these matters."
3_1999canlii12358.txt,"Two female employees filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination contrary to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. The unionized employer applied for judicial review in the nature of prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s.25 of the Trade Union with the result that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The chambers judge found the Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship and granted an order prohibiting the Board of Inquiry from hearing and determining the matter. Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount. HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code. 1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment. 2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect. 3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account. It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.  4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff. No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25] This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment. The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31] One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator. The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction. The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement. To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do.","Two female employees of a unionized employer filed a complaint with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination in their employment contrary to the collective agreement. The employer applied for judicial review in the nature of a prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreements and the Trade Union Act. The Board of Inquiry did not have jurisdiction to hear the complaint. Appeal Allowed; the issue is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment: a board of arbitration appointed pursuant to s. 25(1) of the Collective agreement; or a Board of inquiry established under the Trade union Act. HELD: 1)The parties have included a covenant to comply with the Code in their collective agreement which does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights it proclaims. 2)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform into a human rights violation or breach of the collective Agreement. 3)The dispute is a fundamental human rights issue and one which must be resolved by arbitration or other means. The parties are not able to contract out of human rights provisions. 4)While human rights legislation is not constitutional in nature, it is of such a special nature that it cannot be contracted out of, altered, amended or repealed, except by clear legislative intent and pronouncement. To adopt and apply any theory of implied repeal by later statutory enactment to legislation of this kind would be to rob it of its special nature and give scant protection to its rights which proclaim fundamental law. The essential nature of this complaint is that it is not a dispute arising out of a dispute between the parties about the interpretation, application or violation of an agreement as contemplated by s. 16(1). 5)Individual and collective agreements have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve disputes between employees and employers. Whether or not a complaint is a public interest issue, it bears the essential element of common law and should be taken into account when making decisions of specialized tribunals. 6)The fact that the parties included an anti-discrimination clause (which does not include an exemption from sexual discrimination under s. 8 of the Act but which does) does not change the essential character of the complaint or change the question"
e_2005skqb51.txt,"The plaintiff seeks damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received cut to his scalp. He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning. The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service. The City of Saskatoon is their employer. HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle. The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount. It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements. 1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge. The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty. The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully. The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty. 2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help. Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa. Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty. There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty. 3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions. The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty. The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. 4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention. The plaintiff experienced headaches for several weeks. He also had stiff neck and sleep disturbance. There were no long term effects. Corrigendum received January 25, 2005 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff sought damages for unlawful arrest and assault arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received a cut to his scalp just inside the hairline above his left eye. The events leading up to the arrest and the activity of all participants while in the lounge were not largely in dispute and vary in minor detail only. The actions of the plaintiff outside of the lounge are in dispute. HELD: 1)Credibility.

The husband opposed paying any more spousal support but expressed a preference for lump sum support if he was required to pay more, as it would allow him to move on with his life with his new family. Husband ordered to pay a lump sum award of $10,000 to wife; when the parties moved to Nova Scotia, the husband was able to improve his financial situation, while the wife's position deteriorated.","The parties were married in 1996 and had previously been married in Sweden in 1991. There are no children of their relationship and the only contested issue on this hearing is the respondent's claim for lump sum spousal support.

The respondent was working and living in Sweden at the time of the separation, while the petitioner was living in Nova Scotia.HELD: The respondent is to pay $10,000 per month to the respondent by lump sum. This amount will be contributed by the petitioner. The court has jurisdiction to grant a support order as an incident to divorce. Periodic payments are the norm. However, it is only when a lump sum is the proper vehicle for providing support or when lump sums are necessary to put a person in a particular position that such an award should be made."

Bennett, owner of an office building (the Plaza), leased space to VIP for five years ending in 1997. Issues included (i)whether there had been a valid renewal of the head lease; (ii)whether there had been valid renewals of sub-leases; (iii)assuming valid renewals, did s4 of the Statute of Frauds bar enforcement against Bennett; (iv)whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear an application for relief under s11 brought solely by notice of motion; (v)are the applicants entitled to such relief; (vi)whether Bennett was bound by the sub-leases by virtue of taking the assignment from VIP. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It was assumed that the evidence led by the applicants was true in order to determine issues (iii) and (iv) which dispose of the application. Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits. 2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion. There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this Court than the tenants concerning possession of demised premises. The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry. Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle. grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion. They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease. The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine. In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically. The applciants could obtain other office space including that offered by Bennett. General and punitive damages would provide an adequate remedy.","The applicants sought an order under s.11 of The Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-leases with either V.I.P.

By this time, the head lessee had defaulted in his rent and immediately sought to re-enter the premises. VIP and the applicants had proceeded by notice of motion in circumstances where no 'action' existed. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The evidence led by the applicants was not true. The Court assumed that the actions and performance of the applicants fell short of constituting part of the performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of whether a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine was applied.  2)The applicants were not entitled to the relief sought in Re Golden Griddle because they did not establish the essential requirements for valid renewals of the head lease and their subleases and they failed to agree on its terms.

5_2009nspc10.txt,"The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation. Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana. When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse. He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him. After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment. The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs. Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon. The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search. He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights. Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied. The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached. While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary. Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning. After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case. Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable. The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana. The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge. Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful. The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable. In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.","The accused was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and a charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The accused was in front of a mall when the officers approached him. They noted a strong smell of burned marijuana coming from the accused's person. The officers approached the accused and noted that he was smoking a cigarette. They asked him where the cigarette was and he told them that it was from the inside of the vehicle. The officer did not detect the smell of marijuana from her person and the officer smelled strong, fresh smell of the marijuana on the accused. They arrested him and searched him and found no drugs or alcohol on his person. They searched the vehicle for several minutes and did not find any marijuana. When the officer asked the accused if he was under the influence of marijuana, the accused testified that he had just smoked one. At issue was whether the officer's stated reason for arrest was based upon reasonable and probable grounds. HELD: The accused's statement was found to be free and voluntary. There was no breach of his s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights.  1)The facts were not in dispute. There were three witnesses who gave evidence on the voir dire: the accused was cooperative; the officer had no special training and could not lay claim to extraordinary olfactory acuity, but she was aware of what burned marijuana smelled like. 2)Although there was no police caution prior to the arrest, upon his detention the officer was entitled to be informed of the reason therefor and of his right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, per s. 10 of the Charter; there were no police duties to advise the accused of his rights during the search. 3)The defence had no grounds to exclude the statement given by the accused to the police and, therefore, the Court found that the officer could not rely on an inference that there was a person committing the offence of possession of marijuana. The Court held that the accused elected not to avail himself of the rights conferred upon him by law, rather, by reason of his failure to disclose the facts relevant to the search of his person and because he had not been provided with the information that led to the conclusion that there had been a reasonable inference that more, un-smoked marijuana was present. 4)The court found that it would be unfair and unconscionable for the police to detain the accused until they had found out what the accused had been doing and then refuse to provide that information to the officers. The decision was upheld on appeal"
9_1994canlii4283.txt,"The respondent had undertaken the residential development of certain lands bordering the appellant's property and constructed roadways which it proposed to convey to the Department of Transportation, who agreed to accept with the consent of owners of property where water would drain from the road. When the appellant refused to consent, the respondent applied to the municipality for proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, which failed to achieve agreement. The respondent then filed a requisition with the county clerk pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Act which allows for the appointment of a municipal engineer. The engineer filed a report in which he concluded the respondent was entitled to open a ditch on the appellant's land, subject to certain conditions. In this action, the appellant appealed pursuant to s. 12 of the Act. Allowing the appeal, that the Act appears to assume that landowners will agree that a ditch benefits their land and provides a mechanism for apportioning cost. However, it does not give an engineer authority to expropriate land or take any interest in it, nor does it provide a means by which the appellant is forced to accept the ditch. Further, the common law prohibits the use of another's property to solve one's drainage problems.","The applicant developer, Armoyan, made an application to the municipality of Halifax for implementation of proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act. The applicant failed to agree to the terms of the agreement, and instead filed a requisition with the clerk of the county pursuant to s.7(1) of the Act. HELD: The applicant was awarded costs of $3,000. 1)Armoyan was entitled to continue its ditch to a 'proper outlet' pursuant to the Act and required the consent of the adjacent property owners.  2)The applicant was not entitled to construct a ditch or drain on the Haverstock lands. Rather, it was ordered to design, install, and maintain a storm sewer which must be maintained for the benefit of the upstream public. 3)The award of the respondent's costs against the applicant was refused.

b_2001skca85.txt,"The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease. In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959. The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993. After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner. The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V. The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench. 1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule. The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive. The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society. The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times. Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae. Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule. Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.  2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease. The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed. The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general. The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property. A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough. The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision. The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease. As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971. The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future. The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely.","The trial judge held that the lease was void because it breached the rule against perpetuities and allowed the respondents' action for declaration to that effect. He allowed the counterclaim by the appellant against the respondent for breach of confidence with consequent directions for an accounting and assessment of damages. The principal question on this appeal is whether the appellants' oil and gas 'top lease' with the late Harry Herbert Taylor should be rendered void by the rule. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the respondent's counterclaim is allowed. 1) The trial judge was of the view that the phrase 'farmout agreement' as used in the Freeholders lease was not in breach of the rule because it was based upon the principle of non est factum or breach of s. 17 of the Securities Act. It is only after the time of vesting has been ascertained that a determination can be made about whether that time is too remote and therefore in contravention of the Rule. 2) The history of events after that date is not in dispute.  3) In the context of the present day, the parties were very interested in developing or participating in the development of the mines and minerals within the Taylor land. However, they had not yet established the actual terms of the lease. That uncertainty precluded them from simply proceeding on their own. Rather, they chose to negotiate a farmout agreement with Tarragon. This involved due diligence examination and for that purpose they opened its files and disclosed to Maxx the only existing copy of the agreement between the parties. Maxx Petroleum Ltd.'s files and documents were sent to the respondent so legal analysis could be done."

HELD: A trial of the issue was directed, as it could not be decided on the material filed whether he was intentionally unemployed or underemployed. The father's circumstances had changed since the consent order. The fact he no longer resided with a girlfriend and was making payments on a truck did not justify any reduction.

The respondent father applies to vary a consent order dated April 5, 2001, by reducing his required child support payments from $236 per month to $19.00 per month. The consent order was granted one month after the respondent had quit his employment at Lilydale Foods in Wynyard. Although he remained unemployed, the respondent agreed to pay child support based upon an imputed annual income of $17,386. He purchased a one-half ton truck on which he had been making payments of $624. He now resides with his girlfriend, with whom he shared expenses.

See Magee v. Magee (1997), 1997 CanLII 11187 (SK QB), 159 Sask. R. 223 (Q.B.). The respondent says that he quit his work at the respondent's former employment, which involved shift work and weekends, so that he could exercise access to his children. Given that he agreed to contribute to his current employment, either he expected to earn comparable income elsewhere or he quit to avoid his child support obligation. 3) The second and third 'changed circumstances' do not justify any reduction in child support obligations. [4] Income shouldn't be imputation to a payingor based upon a former employment which is no now available and practicable. The income should not have been imputed in the context of the consent order. The first and third changes did not justify a reduction in his childsupport obligations. 5) The respondent's circumstances have changed since April 2001. He is now employed as tow truck driver and is earning an annualized income of only $7,510. He has purchased a 1/2 ton truck. His expenses have increased from $1,386 to $6.24 per month and he no longer residing in his girlfriend. The second, third and fourth 'changes' are not sufficient to justify an increase in his Child Support obligations. The Court cannot decide that issue on the basis of the material filed.

If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims. The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding. There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved. The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file. To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost.","The plaintiffs sought a stay pending their appeal of a certification order in a class action. The defendants had not filed notice of defence and, pursuant to s. 4(6) of the Act, were not required to do so until 45 days after the certification order was issued. As part of their appeal, they brought a motion for stay on the basis that every cause of action advanced and remedy sought would be contested. They also sought an order declaring that, should the plaintiffs' appeal succeed, the province would be entitled to an award of costs. Motion dismissed; there is no evidence that this will happen. The appeal does not involve a summary judgment motion that would dismiss the claims outright in any form, against the Province; rather, the appeal seeks to strike the Certification Order for common issues trial in class proceeding. The Province has offered no evidence on the point that establishing how defending individual actions would cost the Province less than defending one common issue trial. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with costs of $1,000 payable to the Province in the cause of the appeal. 1) There is no arguable way to quantify the cost of defending individual claims first filed in 2004. It is reasonable to assume that, over the ensuing 8 years, the Province has made significant progress toward drafting its Defence and accumulating its documents. However, there is a potential for prejudicial confusion if the Court of Appeal decides that the proceeding on behalf of the potential claimants on whose behalf the representative plaintiffs commenced the action were to be certified. That is a par for the course of appellate litigation, not irreparable harm. 2) Under the proposed litigation plan that Justice Murphy's decision approved in principle, the next ten months would involve the completion of the pleadings, the exchange of documents and (after documents are exchanged) the discovery of the parties. 3) The Province's grounds of appeal are arguable on their face. There is nothing to estimate that would be significantly higher. Vague and conclusory statements of counsel, without evidence, do not establish the prerequisites for stay of an enforceable order of the Supreme Court. In this case, the judge sensibly intends that there will be only one Notice, published after the court of appeal's decision. This premise, which has a low bar for arguability, is not one that would affect the success of the litigation."
3_1995canlii4243.txt,"The appellant Board granted the respondent temporary total disability benefits on a part-time basis. The respondent contended that it should be on a full-time basis, and applied to the Supreme Court in chambers for an order quashing the appellant's decision. The chambers judge found that the appellant had ignored the clear words of s.37 of the Workers' Compensation Act in reaching its decision, and thus had exceeded its jurisdiction; the decision was quashed and the matter remitted back to the Board. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the order to quash, that s.37 of the Act was not a section limiting the Board's jurisdiction and that, considering s.37 and s.53 of the Act, the decision of the Board was not patently erroneous.","This was an appeal from a decision allowing an application for certiorari to quash a decision of the Workers' Compensation Board and remitting the matter to the Board to determine the rate of compensation payable to the respondent. The respondent had worked for several years for M-I Drilling Fluids Canada and experienced periods of layoff. In 1993, he was laid off full-time employment. He was awarded compensation for one day of work per week (which he was not doing at the time of the accident) and then part-time casual employment. This compensation was designed to replace lost earnings or compensate for lost earning capacity. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision and order of the Chambers judge were set aside. 1)The Board's interpretation of s. 37 of the Act limited its jurisdiction. The Chambers judge held that the interpretation by the Hearing Officer of such provision was one which was subject to review for correctness. The decision was quashed and the matter remitted to the board to determine whether the Board's decision was nevertheless patently erroneous and properly set aside in any event. 2)There was no sensible interpretation of the provisions of the act in the Chambers decision. The Board was not exercising proper due diligence in assessing the appropriateness of awarding compensation to a party who had not been disabled."
b_1999canlii12407.txt,"The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations. It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability. The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances. The essential facts were not in dispute. HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.  1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met. This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site. Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available. Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced. The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching. No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision. The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups. 2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible. There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor. The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship. The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages.","The defendant was charged with seven violations of The Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 being Chapter 0-1.1 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan and Regulations made pursuant to the Act. The defendant had obtained a contract from the Hamlet to install sewer and water lines on four lots in St. George's Hill. This contract was arranged to be performed by using the services of an individual he knew as a 'employer' who was hired to do the backhoe work on the excavation. The contract stipulated that the defendant was to pay wages on an hourly basis according to the defendant and had no prospect of making profit on the job. When the contract fell apart, the defendant, who had been the foreman of the contract, arranged for his nephew to work with him to assist him in laying the pipe. The nephew was not performing the job as the defendant intended but was responsible for the rest of the work. HELD: The report was inadmissible without addressing the technical aspects of the ruling or making a formal comment on the legal arguments put forth pro and con regarding the issue of admissibility.  1)Once one finds that there was a legal duty on the defendant as an employer under the Act, his obligations under the law are to take active steps to supervise and oversee the excavations to make sure the usual protocols for job safety are met. At minimum this would have required the presence of an experienced person on site. 2)If the defendant did have an obligation to discharge it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances, it was unnecessary to leave it to another court on another day when the issue may be central to the outcome of case to carefully consider the matter and to rule in an authoritative and precedentially significant manner at that time."
c_2008nssm39.txt,"The applicant law firm applied for a taxation of accounts in a complicated family law matter. The client contended that there was obvious overbilling and that the solicitor was negligent in failing to specify in an interim Order the actual time at which she had to leave the matrimonial home. Accounts as presented are certified; there was no indication whatsoever of overbilling, whether with respect to legal fees or disbursements, and there was no negligence on the part of the solicitor as she had acted reasonably in relying on the representations of the husband's lawyer as to when the Order would be enforced. It is not always necessary to examine every single entry in detail on a line-by-line basis; an overall view of the entries contained in an account can be taken when assessing reasonableness. The temporal limitation of cross-examination is within the Small Claims Court's scope of discretion in special circumstances.","The applicant sought a taxation of the accounts that it issued to the respondent. The respondent opposed the application, claiming that the applicant's estranged husband had either been convicted of or plead guilty to a criminal charge and he did not pay a significant fine associated with the crime. The applicant argued that to limit cross-examination in this manner would constitute a breach of natural justice. She also alleged that the respondent was negligent in the execution of a court order which granted interim exclusive possession of the matrimonial home and the interim custody of the child of the marriage to her estranged husband. In issue was whether the respondent authorized the applicant to cross-examine her on numerous occasions during the course of her taxation hearing; whether the applicant authorized the respondent to make such an appearance on her behalf and, in particular, whether she was aware of the legal issues at hand. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The respondent was entirely unsuccessful in establishing any negligence on the part of the appellant, who was clearly articulate and capable of representing herself, and focused on the reasonableness of her legal accounts rather than on vexatious questioning. 2)There was very little in the Small Claims Court Act that specifically sets out the procedure to be followed in the Court. Section 6(6) of the Act provides that decision makers, when appointed, must take and subscribe an oath before a judge of the Supreme Court whereby the judge promises to do right to all manner of people after the laws of the Province without fear, favour, affection or ill will. There are no serious issues of credibility that must be determined. 3)Prior participation as basis for disqualification, without something more, appears to be the exact type of shortcut in reasoning that is inappropriate in such cases of alleged apprehension of bias."
3_1996canlii5007.txt,"The appellants applied to adduce fresh evidence and to amend the statement of claim. The appellant's solicitor at the time of the trial had called no expert evidence concerning either the proper construction of the chimney, which was alleged to be faultily constructed, or the cause of the fire. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V, including costs of the motion to adduce fresh evidence. 1)The evidence was clearly available, clearly contemplated by the parties and for whatever reason not called. 2)The trial judge neither misapprehended nor failed to take into account evidence which was before him in arriving at his conclusion concerning the causation of the fire. There was evidence to permit the trial judge to make the findings of fact that he did and to award the damages based on those findings.","The appellants applied to adduce fresh evidence and to amend the statement of claim in the within action. The tests for the admission of fresh evidence were set out in R. v. Lensen, 1987 CanLII (SCC), [1987] S.C.R. 672 and [1988] SCC, 80 Sask. R. 14 (Sask C.A.). The appellant contended that the expert evidence which he wished to tender was relevant, credible and if believed could reasonably, when taken with all the other evidence, be expected to have affected the respondent's residence. He candidly conceded that, with due diligence it could have been adduced at the trial.

1996canlii6900.txt,"A decree nisi and an order granting custody to the mother was made in 1995. Upon appeal the Court of Appeal directed a new trial. Changes in circumstances included the fact that the child was developmentally delayed and required a special program. A pediatrician testified that inconsistency in parenting approaches would further delay the child's development. HELD: Custody was awarded to the father. 1)Each parent was a capable caregiver. However, the father was available to provide full-time care due to an employment disability and exhibited a strong desire to do so. The past physical abuse of his former spouse was not considered relevant as it did not affect his ability to parent the child. 2)The mother was to have weekly access on two non-consecutive days for eight hours and two hours on a third day. The child was to sleep in the same bed every night.","Saskatchewan: Two parents sought custody of the child on the grounds that he or she was best able to meet her needs. The central issue was what custody arrangement would be in Sophie's best interests. Each parent presented volumes of evidence respecting the shortcomings of the other, all with the view of discrediting the other's ability to act as a custodial parent. HELD: 1)The issues arose in the context of a divorce action. 2)Each parent was a capable caregiver. 3)Because of his employment disability, he remains available to provide full-time care for Sophie and exhibits a very strong desire todo so. 4)Each party was awarded joint custody with the express purpose of demonstrating that the child's needs require a better understanding of her needs and the world in which she was born. 5)Each child was to start the Buckwold Centre program in the fall of 1996 with the full support of her parents. The custody order was granted in August 1994 and the Court of Appeal directed a new trial."
2006skqb189.txt,"FIAT: The issues on this application are with respect to extraordinary expenses and the quantum of spousal support. HELD: 1) The petitioner's income is $73,000 versus $29,000 for the respondent. The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2) The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law. At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law. What items claimed are necessary to attain the child's best interests and yet are reasonable given the economic circumstances of the child and her parents? Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support? 2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.  3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse. These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI. These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case. However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700. The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future.","FIAT: The respondent moves for an order granting to her, (1) joint custody and primary care (residence) of the child, with access to her former spouse; (2) interim child support in the sum of $700 per month retroactive to January 1, 2006; (3) interim spousal support in $750 per month. HELD: 1) The evidence upon the issue of retroactivity is minimal and the positions are conflicting. Therefore, child support shall commence in April 2006 inasmuch as the petitioner pays $625 per month and 71% of special or extraordinary expenses as hereafter described. 2) The parties agreed that the need and corresponding ability to pay are predominant considerations at the interim stage, yet not to the exclusion of the statutory factors and objectives recited by the Divorce Act and Family Maintenance Act. However, the petitioner is no longer expected to contribute $80 per month to service family debt. The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spOUSal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issues in the future."
9_2001canlii390.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter. The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means. Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand. The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole. Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes. The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. 3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment. The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired, contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code; and with driving over.08, contrary under s.253(a). The accused was cooperative throughout and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and breath demand, which were read to him from a printed card. HELD: 1) In the circumstances herein, the officer observed the accused's vehicle sit through the green lights but thereafter, he responded immediately and awoke when he took hold of his wrist. As well, he appeared to fully comprehend the circumstances in which he was involved. However, the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot did not constitute reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand.  2) The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. He walked him back to the police vehicle, and he did not observe any problems with balance or manner of walk. The accused's eyes were glassy and glassy. 3) In respect to the admissibility of the evidence, in the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the police officer was not able to find any reasonable or probable grounds to make a breath demand despite the fact that he was immediately awakened when the officer grabbed him by the wrist. The officer was able to conclude with a brief and cursory observation of the accused that his ability to operate the motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drug. On the same evidence, he observed that the vehicle did not move despite that the traffic light turned green at least twice. 4) The nature and quality of this evidence of impairment is so frail as to leave the officer with a reasonable doubt as to impairment. Therefore, the accused is not guilty of the charge under the s.8 and s.9 of the Charter.  5) In other cases, the Court held that a certificate is not to be admitted where the 'prerequisite reasonable and likely grounds' have not been present. In either event, the peace officer is vested with a very important responsibility which is intended to ensure that members of the public are not subjected to breath demand and all of the serious consequences that may flow from it, in which the accused has been made out. In the process of making its analysis, the Ontario Court of Appeal judgment made reference to the so-called 'classic"" signs of impairment, namely: erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's"

The father now applied for interim sole custody, alleging that the ongoing extreme conflict between the parties was adversely affecting the children. An assessment recommended that the children live with the father and have access with the mother. Father granted interim sole care, custody and control of the children. The serious concerns raised by the assessment satisfied the threshold requirement of a material change in circumstances; the urgency of the concerns required immediate action.","This was an application to vary the terms of the parties' 2001 Corollary Relief Judgment respecting parenting. The parties had entered into a Separation Agreement in 2000 which was incorporated into the Corollaries Relief Judgment in May 2001. The father had been seeking sole custody of the children. The mother had refused to implement his recommendations, and had relied on the assessment to support her concerns.

b_2018skca27.txt,"HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed and sentence appeal allowed. The sentence was varied to 12 months of probation. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced. The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one. She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence. The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony;  2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference. He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA. The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016. Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice. To impose a custodial sentence on the appellant in this case would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it would impede the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The court decided that a fit sentence in this case would be 12 months of probation.","The appellant was convicted after trial of sexually assaulting his 11-year-old niece contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The appellant applied to admit into evidence the transcript of the first trial and an affidavit of the appellant's former babysitter, which outlines discussions between the appellant and his counsel prior to and during the second trial. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentence appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was varied to 12 months of probation. 1) The trial judge correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in sentencing youth to a high sentence. 2) The appellant had identified certain inconsistent statements in respect of which his counsel did not cross-examine the complainant, he has failed to establish these omissions amount to unreasonable professional judgment that reach the threshold of incompetence. 3) The evidence must meet the criteria for the admission of fresh evidence as set forth in Palmer (1979), 1979 CanLII (SCC), [1980] SCR 759 at 775. 4) It is well understood that an appellate court must show 'great deference' to a trial judge's assessment of witness credibility. A trial judge must establish the facts, including the acts or omissions of trial counsel, upon which the claim of incompetence is based. Second, the appellant must establish that the representation provided by the trial judge was incompetent. The appeal must be dismissed. 5) The evidentiary onus on an appellant alleging incompetent counsel was outlined in Short (2012 SKCA 85). An appellate court may substitute its own sense of an appropriate sentence for the one imposed by trial level court in only two circumstances. The first is when the sentence is demonstrably unfit. The second is when it is unfit as it contradicts the principles, purpose and provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA)."
1997canlii11078.txt,"The applicant sought to be appointed as property guardian for his uncle pursuant to s19 of the Dependent Adults Act. The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years. The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs. He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951. Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew. There was no dispute that the uncle was the beneficial owner.HELD: The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand. The conditional stay in place pending the resolution of this application for the appointment of a property guardian was lifted. 1)The proposed dependent adult was capable of managing a significant portion of his business affairs and matters relating to his estate and property. However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit. His suggestions and proposal to sell the land and travel were reasonable and financially modest. 2)The criteria set forth in s18 for the appointment of a property guardian was met and the Public Trustee was appointed to administer the balance of the proceeds from the land sale remaining after the uncle pursued his financial commitments and his dreams.  3)Costs in the amount of $7,000 were to be paid to the applicant in the event the uncle chose to sell his land. 4)Any proposed sale would be subject to the approval of the Court upon application of Hand.

He now sought to have the land registered in his name. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand. 2)The applicant was of the view that at this stage in his life the land should be vested directly into his control to pursue his financial commitments and hisdreams, with the balance being placed in the hands of the Public Trustee as his property guardian. 3)The prescribed prescribed amounts for the vesting were $7,000.00 for the purposes of ensuring an adequate return was received for the sale of the land. 4)The public trustee was to administer the rest of the funds in accordance with s. 34 of The Trustees Act. 5)The court found that the applicant was entitled to manage his property unless he was not competent to do so."

HELD: 1) The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable. In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations. In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice? This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues. The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer? 2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice. When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice.

The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995, seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) The applicant has no standing to bring an application under s. 135 of the Act. It would be counterintuitive not to add CFS as a party to the application. 2) In this jurisdiction such relief is discretionary. The burden lies on the party seeking the right to cross-examine to show the examination will assist in resolving the issue before the chambers judge. To read the word 'election' in the section as anything other than referring to the election of director or auditor requires interpretive contortions beyond my ability. 3) In Abrahamson v. Baker and Smishek (1964), 1964 CanLII 380 (SK CA), 50 W.W.R. 664 (Sask. C.A.), which addressed the same issue, it is not necessary to address those complaints. 4) The conduct complained of by the applicant falls within the ambit of s. 225(1). He complains about the manner in which the activities of the corporation have been conducted. The authority in s.225(2) gives the court the necessary power to address such wrongs and are sufficiently broad so as to subsume an order declaring a referendum of no force or effect. 5) In B.C.S.C.'s case law clearly directs that my mind set must be very circumspect."
6_1999skqb124.txt,"The plaintiff who had been employed by the defendant's predecessor for 23 years as office manager and bookkeeper until 1997, brought an action for damages against her new employers for dismissal without adequate notice. The plaintiff took stress leave and requested to be relieved of her duties as office manager in 1998. The action proceeded under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period. Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause. Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time. Her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. She remained entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at the time of termination and to medical expenses that would have been covered but without bonuses or extra payments for sick pay. 2)The defendant did not establish the plaintiff ought to have done more to mitigate her loss. There was no basis for punitive damages nor for an extension of the period of notice.  3)The net earnings between May 1998 and March 1999 were deducted after deducting $50 for the cost of qualifying for that employment. Amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant were to be deducted. 4)The plaintiff was entitled to interest in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 5)The defendant could make no deduction for insurance benefit payments. Sections 45 and 46 of the Employment Insurance Act was drawn to their attention. 6)The plaintiff was awarded costs. Fees were to be taxed on column 2. 7)The plaintiff was to deliver a copy of the calculation of the judgment. Either could issue judgment with the other's consent as to form and content. An application for further directions could be made.","The plaintiff brought an action for wrongful dismissal or, stating it more correctly, for damages for dismissal from her employment without adequate notice. The action was under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of The Queen's Bench Rules. At trial, the affidavits-in-chief of the plaintiff's witnesses were marked as plaintiff exhibits and the witnesses were then called for cross-examination by the defendant followed by redirect questions from plaintiff's counsel. At the conclusion of the action, the defendant was to be deducted the amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant. This does not include the Saxby account which predated the transfer of the business. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment with costs. Fees were taxed on column 2. 1)The plaintiff had been employed by Saxby for some 23 years and had become the office manager, bookkeeper and, generally, the key office person. Her role included decision making, especially in matters relating to the accounts. 2)The conduct to which she refers may be viewed as constructive dismissal and was accepted as such by her. But her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. The defendant can therefore make no deduction for any such insurance payments made to the plaintiff. 3)The theory of notice is that at the end of the period the employment insurance benefits will remain unimpaired. In this case, equal latitude may be required in plaintiff's cross- examination of the defendant's witnesses. If the parties do not agree on the amount thereof, the matter may be referred to me, if necessary, by application for further directions."

She also stated that just prior to this she was awakened by the feeling of someone touching her vagina. The accused was charged with sexual assault and sexual touching of the complainant., accused found not guilty; the complainant's testimony was internally inconsistent and her cross-examination revealed obvious errors which were never corrected to rehabilitate her credit. The evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and the accused's evidence raised reasonable doubts in the court's mind.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching of the complainant. The complainant was a close friend of the accused's. She recalled that the accused had moved over and touched her breast and vaginal area while she was asleep. The accused testified that he had just bought pizza for the girls. The parties had retired to the living room where they all sat and watched television. During the evening, the complainant awoke and felt something in her pyjamas. She did not see the accused touch her, but rather heard him lean over and kiss her on the breast and then move to the window on the opposite side of the bed. When the girls finished watching a movie, the accused and the complainant retired to their respective bedrooms to watch television. After watching the movie, they had a quiet evening and the accused, who had recently broken up with his girlfriend, came into the bedroom to watch TV. When she awoke, she saw the accused standing beside the bed and she opened her mouth to scream. However, she did not open her mouth and instead spoke to her friend about the incident. She then closed her eyes and gave a vague and ambiguous description of the event, which led to the conclusion that she had not been consciously aware of any external bodily stimulus and would be unable to identify any causative agent unless that medium or effect was still in progress when she became consciously and emotionally aware of her surroundings. Finally, she concluded that the touching was consensual and that it would be unsafe to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt the accused sexually assaulted the complainant or touched her for a sexual purpose, or at all. The Court held that the evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and the Court was not persuaded, on the total evidence and that which accepted, that the Crown had proved beyond a reasonably reasonable doubt on the Information tried before me that, between the 19th day of October 2001 and the 19 November 2001 the accused or the accused touched her with his hand.

2005nsca64.txt,"The chambers judge refused to grant an adoption to a single mother of her own daughter as he determined that the child would not gain anything vis a vis the mother by such an adoption but would lose the potential for a relationship and support from her father. The evidence before the chambers judge was meagre but showed that the father had not seen the child for the past four years. The mother appealed., appeal dismissed; the chambers judge focused on the best interests of the child and did not fail to give appropriate consideration to the factors set out in the Act. He did not place too much emphasis on the child's loss of a potential relationship with and support from the father on the facts of this case.",The appellant single mother appealed the November 2004 decision of the Children and Family Services judge refusing to grant her the adoption she sought with respect to her four year old daughter. The appellant was not married at the time of the daughter's birth and remains single. The child's father has had no contact with her nor has he provided any child support since November 2000. It is not known if the appellant and the child have lived with the father or anyone else or if there is contact between the child and the extended families of either parent. The father was not notified of the application and has not consented. Notice of the proposed adoption was given to the Minister of Community Services as required by s.76(1) of the Act. The Minister did not make any recommendation regarding the adoption and did not conduct a home study. The chambers judge refused to grant the adoption on the basis that it was not in the child's best interests to do so even though he found all of the technical requirements for the adoption had been complied with. He agreed with the appellant that the child would continue to be in exactly the same position in terms of her relationship with her father whether the adoption was granted or not. The adoption will not change that relationship. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no evidence to support the appellant's argument that the chambers judge erred in considering other relevant circumstances (ie. the loss of possible contact with and support from her father if the adoption were granted).  2)The only evidence before the judge was the usual documentation provided to court with an application for an uncontested adoption. On the facts the appellant did not err when he balanced the neutral impact the adoption would have on the child’s relationship with the mother against the loss to the child of her possible relationship with a support from the father. There was a net loss of the child if the application was granted. 3)The chambers judge agreed that the father was entitled to notice but was not required to consent to the adoption. He did not identify and weigh the factors which should be considered in answering that question.
2_2003skpc44.txt,"The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b). Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600. The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'. The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on. The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement. Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair. The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts. At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven. 1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA. If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group. Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive. It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so. The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation. It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time). 3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character. 4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period. The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product. The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed.","The plaintiff was not a partner in Triple R and was engaged in consignment auto sales with Triple R's knowledge and consent. Triple R offered the plaintiff a car for his daughter. The plaintiff purchased the vehicle for $1,600. He was not satisfied that the vehicle was unsafe from the outset. He sought recovery of the purchase price and the costs that he had incurred for repair and inspection. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $1542.35 plus costs of $20 for a total of $1563.35. 1)The consignee was a retail seller within the meaning of the Act and accordingly was deemed to have given the plaintiff's vehicle a reasonable period of time. The costs incurred for repairs and inspection were foreseeable and were properly recoverable. 2)The plaintiff did not reject the vehicle. The dealer was not negligent in failing to establish the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty. In the circumstances the plaintiff did reject the goods within a reasonable time. 3)Triple R was not subject to the exception provisions at the end of the definition of a'retail seller'. The dealer bore the burden of establishing the exceptions.  4)The automobile was driven almost 5,000 km before the seriousness of the problem was discovered. The vehicle was driven slightly less than 5kkm."
c_2017skqb144.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the property be sold and the proceeds of sale take into account the amount necessary to protect the respondent father’s claim. The Partition Act, 1868 applies in the province. It did not allow the equitable principles of unjust enrichment and constructive trust to operate to create a proprietary interest. The court found that s. 4 of the Act applied, which provides a monetary remedy so that if the respondent father could establish entitlement to some amount for his maintenance and improvement costs, he would be protected for that amount for his costs.","The parties applied to partition and sale of a lake front recreational property owned by them and their brother. Each of the parties owns an undivided one quarter interest as tenants in common in the property. The property is located next door to another property that until recently was the permanent residence of the parents. They are now separated and may have to be sold. The parties argue that the benefit and corresponding detriment must have occurred without juristic reason. They claim that Ronald, through the operation of the principle of unjust enrichment and resulting or constructive trusts, has contributed over and above the contributions of the others. Ronald claims that he has made improvements to the property that have made it more convenient for the parties to share in the maintenance and improvements. They also claim that they have received a fair share of the proceeds from the sale. HELD: 1) The Court's discretion to refuse partition under s. is limited. If this case is governed by s. the application will be allowed as cannot see anything in the evidence that suggests that the Applicants are motived by malice or are being vexatious or oppressive. 2) There are three elements that must be satisfied in order for a claim in unjust enrichment to succeed: there must be an enrichment of the defendant, corresponding deprivation of the plaintiff, and an absence of juristic reasons; the remedy of constructive or resulting trust will give the Respondents collectively an interest in the Property greater than 50%.  3) There must be a reasonable expectation that the parties will realize their capital value. This opens the door to consider the manner in which the parties organized their relationship and whether an injustice has arisen that without equity cannot be remedied. It is precisely where an injustice arises without a legal remedy that equity finds role. 4) In seeking partition, the Court has discretion to grant an order which would cause inconvenience and hardship to the defendant but, if it thinks fit, to direct Sale of the Property. In either case, if a sale is directed the court may or shall give all necessary or proper consequential directions which may include, where one of the owners gives an undertaking to purchase the interest of the party requesting sale, valuation of the property; and in the latter case, to order Valuation of the Share of the Party requesting Sale in such Manner as the Court thinks fit."

HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $30,737.93 plus costs plus pre-judgment interest. 1)The plaintiff had taken all reasonable steps to mitigate her losses. The duty is to take such steps as a reasonable person would take in his own interests to maintain his income and position in his industry, trade or profession. The former employer has no right to expect that the former employee will accept a lower paying alternative employment with doubtful prospects. 2)Reasonable notice would have been ten months. She had been erroneously requested to take 19.871 days as annual leave and therefore actually received one months' notice. Nine months salary at $26,514.00 plus $1,325 for lost pension benefits and $564 for the Canada Pension Plan were awarded. She was to be compensated for 19.871 days of combined time in lieu and annual leave.","The plaintiff was employed with the defendant, Gabriel Dumont Institute of Native Studies and Applied Research, from January 1983 to May 1993. She was the sole supporter of her family as her husband was unemployed. The plaintiff had taken all reasonable steps to mitigate her damages, including turning down an offer of employment from another company. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded 9 months salary in lieu of notice.  1)The defendant failed to mitigate its damages under the head of the head in that it erroneously requested the plaintiff take 19.871 days of combined time-in-lieu and annual leave which she had earned as annual leave. Therefore, the plaintiff only received 1 month's notice. 2)The defendants were awarded damages in excess of $30,000. The court considered the effect of the recession in Saskatchewan and the consequent unavailability of similar employment in the province. The trial judge was entitled to find the plaintiff justified in rejecting the offer.  3)The plaintiff had worked for 14 years as an administrative assistant to the director of the institute. She had also completed an eight month secretarial course.  4)The court assessed the damages at $2,946.00 per month, $1,325.00 for the period of 9 months and $31,737.93 for the defendants.  5)In assessing reasonable notice, the court looked at the individual's damages in relation to the employer's failure to establish that its former employee has failed in their duty of mitigation. The damages were assessed in the amount of $26,514.93."
e_2005skqb549.txt,"There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on solicitor-client basis. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought notice of motion seeking an order from the Court an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items. The defendants denied any obligation to redeem the plaintiff's preferred shares, and asserted that they would be unable to pay its liabilities as they fell due. The plaintiff brought an application for leave to amend the statement of defence and an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(e) for an order granting her summary judgment for the sum of $214,600 plus interest at rate of 16% per annum. HELD: The plaintiff's motion does not require the defendant to make any payment to purchase or redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the court is in agreement with her that the corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares in essence, but rather, following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff in this case does represent debt or liquidated demand as that phrase is contemplated in s. 34(2) of the Business Corporations Act.

Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600, that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages. The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company. The damages are the amount by which the actual value of the company was less than what the respondent paid at the time of purchase.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages flowing from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business. The appellant was a businessman living in Port Hawkesbury and the numbered company was his vehicle used to acquire the business. It was at this time that he began to become aware of the company's real financial situation. He had undertaken significant personal obligations and had used substantial additional funds at considerable risk. The trial judge concluded that the first approach was to be preferred as it looked at the company as a going concern on the transaction date rather than assuming liquidation at a future date. He therefore awarded direct damages of $200,000 representing lost return on investment opportunities for 7 years.  In the alternative, the respondent could have purchased the company earlier but for the trial judge's decision which awarded him $1,800,000 for direct damages."

The lottery money was spent on household finances and lost in husband's small business venture. Husband 'spent more money on alcohol than he should have'. HELD: This did not amount to dissipation of matrimonial property within the meaning of the Act. Husband's mismanagement of the family's financial affairs was grounds for unequal division of the property:","The applicant sought a division of matrimonial property, custody and maintenance under the Matrimonial Property Act, and custody of the two youngest children pursuant to The Deserted Wives and Children's Maintenance Act. The parties owned modest home and equity in the said home of approximately $16,000. The respondent borrowed money and bought some trenching equipment. This business failed and resulted in substantial loss. The trenching business was repossessed, the matrimonial home had to be sold and the mini-motor home was gone. The family took more holidays and did more travelling. In the meantime, the respondent spent heavily on alcohol and spent more money on alcohol. He was in arrears of maintenance for the two younger children. HELD: 1)The respondent was to be given custody of his 2 children and the two oldest were to have custody of their own. 2)The applicant was to have her name shown on the property as his own and her name also be shown in the lot for the purposes of the rent on the home and the children's maintenance. 3)Renting for the purpose of leaving the property to the registrar for future rent will be taken into account. 4)With the exception of those items already taken into custody by the respondent for his own purposes, the court ordered that the property be divided equally.

She also asked that an order prohibiting the administration or disbursement of the estate of the testator without leave of the court, until the issues referred to above are resolved by order of the Court or agreement of the parties. HELD: 1) The testator was appointed as his personal and property Power of Attorney. The executor of the November 3, 2005 will filed his affidavit. 2) There was a general principle of probate law emanating from the case of Barry v. Butlin (1838), 12 E.R. 1089, which says that if a testator is not induced by undue influence to sign a will, then it is for those who propound the will to overcome the suspicion. In this case, the issue of undue influence cannot be resolved without a trial of the issue. It is necessary so that the matter can properly be assessed by the Court. 3) There shall be an order directing a trial to prove the last will of Roland Linkert.

e_2013skqb390.txt,"HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault. The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats. The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability. The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years. The sentences were to be served concurrently.","The accused was found guilty, after trial, of two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was a 61 year old single male suffering from epilepsy who lived in Labrador and lived there until 1980 when he moved to Regina. He had two previous convictions of sexual interference on children, one of which was for a sexual assault which involved touching the complainant's breasts and vaginal area, touching the victim's spouse or common-law partner and touching her inappropriately. The complainant was on social assistance at the time of the offences and had a back problem which prevented him from gaining employment. The Court of Appeal assessed the accused's record at a low risk to re-offend, given his previous criminal record and his current state of mind. HELD: 1)Three years was the appropriate starting point for the sexual assault as it was a singular incident and the accused was not in a position of trust in relation to the complainant. The fact that this was a single incident of sexual touching that occurred over a few seconds gave rise to the idea that the accused, who had two prior convictions for sexual interference, was a high risk to offend again. If the accused is found guilty of this type of offence, the sentence he is sentenced to will be similar to that imposed on the accused in R. v. Revet, 2010 SKCA 71 (CanLII), 350 Sask. R. 292) and the cases cited therein. 2)There was no reason why the same starting point should not be used in a case such as this."

HELD: The imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of victim's statements and videotaped statements in cases of sexual assault does not prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11 of the Charter. The obligation to disclose is not absolute. The Corwn's obligation to protect the privacy of the complainants is fulfuilled by providing the statements and videotapes to counsel for the accused on trust condition that counsel retain them in his possession. The information contained therein is available to the accused and retained experts for use in preparing his defence. Since the accused knows the sustance of the complaints and, therefore, the case he has to meet, there is no danger to the fairness of the trial by virtue of the trust condition attached to disclosure. The public interest is served and the integrity of the criminal justice system is maintained when complainants are assured that staements and videotapes will not be reproduced. Application dismissed.","FIAT. A person charged with two counts of sexual assault applied for a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter and s. 650(3) of Criminal Code compelling the respondent to provide full and complete disclosure of the complainant statements. HELD: 1)The material filed by the Crown was sufficient to establish a considerable problem with wrongful use of complainant statements generally but not the degree in which it exists in this jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal made specific mention of the respondent's failure to provide copies of certain disclosure material to the accused. 2)The respondent was aware that his rights pursuant to s. 7, 11(a) and 11(d) were violated. It is important to note that the applicant contends not for less onerous trust conditions or undertakings but that disclosure be without a trust condition or undertaking of any sort. 3)The nature, extent and effect of the condition in this case was that the respondent was restricted by the court to giving the applicant a copy of any videotape provided to him by his counsel or an expert witness.  4)The court was able to take some comfort in finding that the defence counsel's undertaking to provide the videotape was not in breach of the accused's right to fair trial or of the protection of the complainants."

HELD: 1) The accused was found not guilty of sexual assault. 2) The accused was found guilty of unlawful confinement. 3) The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The Court did not accept the accused's invoking of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused admitted to striking the complainant with a closed fist five times as hard as he could and the force used was excessive. 4) The accused was found guilty of threatening to kill the complainant at the hotel. 5) The accused was found guilty of uttering death threats and breach of recognizance by contacting the complainant. The Court did not accept his testimony and denial.","The defendant was found not guilty of sexual assault, assault causing bodily harm, unlawful confinement and uttering death threats. The complainant swore she tried to flee several times after the melee in the hotel room, but the defendant punched her in the face and choked her. He was at large on his recognizance entered into by a Justice or a Judge and was bound to comply with a condition that he not contact or communicate directly or indirectly with the complainant except through a member of the Law Society of Saskatchewan. The defendant was also found guilty of possession of stolen goods. During the events at the hotel, the defendant threatened to kill the complainant and the defendant was acquitted of the sexual assault charge. The elements required for self-defence were not present in the defendant's testimony. He did not appear forthright in comparing the overall demeanor of the two witnesses, the complainant was more straightforward and direct than the defendant, while there was no requirement that the defendant measure his force to a nicety and the force used was excessive. On the facts, none of these avails the defendant."
d_1996canlii7113.txt,"The question was whether a corporate board could breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government sponsored community bond program in order to establish its business. The Shareholders' Agreement obliged all shareholders to vote their shares so as to confirm the nominees of certain shareholders, thereby freezing the board composition without regard for its performance. As a result the board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though the Government of Saskatchewan and Bondco were entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the company, they could not change the board and did not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes. Members of Bondco were concerned that jobs were being obtained in Saskatoon at the expense of Rosetown jobs and the economic spin-offs expected from their $800,000 investment were not being realized in Rosetown due to the opening of the Saskatoon facility. An application was brought under s234 of the Business Corporations Act. They sought a restraining order enforcing the covenant, an order appointing new directors, an order of compensation for breach of contract and an order directing the closure of the Saskatoon operation and the return of company assets to Rosetown district unless Bondco granted written consent. HELD: It was ordered that 1)the Shareholders Agreement was amended deleting the offending paragraph concerning the Board of Directors and substituting a new paragraph; 2)certain provisions of the Articles of Continuance as amended were suspended until the Termination Date; 3)the present board was suspended pending the election of directors at a special meeting of shareholders; 4)the respondent was enjoined from moving its operations and from transferring or hiring employees at any place other than Rosetown District unless Bonco's written consent was filed with the Court. 5)The Chief Executive Officer was not displaced nor was the Saskatoon operation directed to be closed.  6)Bonco was entitled to its taxable costs against the individual respondents.","A motion raised the question of the right of a corporate board to breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government-sponsored community bond program in order to establish itsbusiness.

The actions of the corporate president and his supporters were directed to be set aside. 2)The applicant was ordered, pursuant to s. 234(2) of the Business Corporations Act, to remove the president and CEO of the corporation and to take appropriate steps to consolidate its operations. 3)The director was to be directed to withdraw from the municipality or to attend a special meeting of the directors convened by Bondco to confirm the directors' written consent.  4)The court had the power to make changes in the corporation's affairs so as to resolve the problem."

While there was no direct evidence to establish the plaintiff set the fire himself, the inference was drawn that he did or, in the alternative, caused someone else to do so.  2)Had the plaintiff been in the mobile home he should have been suffering to some degree from carbon monoxide poisoning, he should have been coughing, his hair should have been singed, he would have had soot on his face and his clothes would have smelled of smoke. 3)The plaintiff did not call evidence to rebut the fire investigator's opinion that a significant quantity of fire accelerant had been used nor was his brother called to confirm his testimony that he attempted to re-enter the mobile home after arranging for the fire department to be called.","The plaintiff's residence, mobile home and contents were insured with the defendant who had denied liability alleging that the plaintiff intentionally started the fire or caused it to be started.

8_2009nssc261.txt,"The Trustee opposed the bankrupt's application for a discharge on various grounds. The bankrupt supported four children and had been discharged from the military due to illness arising from her active service. The bankrupt will be entitled to an absolute discharge once certain conditions are met, including the payment of one month's rent, the value of the horses and surplus income for nine months to the Trustee. The bankrupt's disability pension from Veterans' Affairs was not included in the calculation of surplus income as the public policy reason behind the exemption for proceeds received due to personal injury and a soldier's danger pay applied to this disability pension. The Trustee had no claim to the insurance proceeds received by the bankrupt following the loss of her home by fire as it was a modest sum used to replace lost personal exempt assets; the three horses were found to be owned by the bankrupt as opposed to her children, for whom she had purchased them as pets and were included in the value of her estate; the court exercised its discretion in determining the amount of surplus income, noting that the administration of the estate had been unusually hostile and it was important that the bankrupt be able to stabilize her family finances.","The respondent asked that she be discharged from bankruptcy as she suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Major Depression Disorder and Borderline Personality Organization. These illnesses entitle her to a pension from the Department of Veterans Affairs. She refused to cooperate with the Trustee on this application and argued that they were assets of the estate and that she should be compensated for the loss of her household goods which were taken from her in the event of her bankruptcy. HELD: The respondent was entitled to an absolute discharge. 1)The respondent was not asked to make detailed analysis of what is exempt and what is not exempt. The evidence at the hearing was that she did not. 2)She had little time to make arrangements. She incurred expenses in moving. She had to act quickly under very stressful circumstances. 3)There are other ways to determine surplus income, such as under the Judicature Act or under the Civil Procedure Rules whereby this information might have been obtained and possibly may now be obtained. There was ample time for this to have been addressed.  4)It is well established law that any cause of action arising from bodily injury, mental suffering, or injury to reputation or character or the proceeds thereof is personal and does not vest in the trustee. It is not the policy of the law to convert into money for creditors the mental or physical anguish of the bankrupt. Put another way, the creditors are not entitled to benefit from that which the bankrupt receives to make whole her injured body, mind or reputation. 5)In the circumstances, the respondent's obligation to pay surplus income of $325 per month for the basic bankruptcy period of 9 months to 12 months is not unreasonable. The Court reviewed the various types of surplus income and found that most of the surplus income should be paid in the amount of $1,500 per month."
d_2012nssc139.txt,"The applicant is the only drug store in a rural community. The respondent worked there for 30 years, in various positions. He signed a 5-year, 10 mile non-competition clause in 1995. He quit in early March with the intention of opening a new drug store down the street in early April. Other key staff members intended to quit and work in the new store. The applicant moved for an interim injunction to prevent the respondent from opening his store pending the hearing of their motion for an interlocutory injunction. Interim injunction granted. The new Civil Procedure Rules (2008) distinguish between interim and interlocutory injunctions. This is one of the circumstances which was contemplated when the new Rule 41.04 was enacted. Urgency exists and the applicant can't wait. While the non-competition clause may well not survive a challenge at the full hearing of the interlocutory injunction motion, all the applicant needs to show is that there is a serious issue to be tried. There is. This isn't a frivolous or vexatious application. There's a high potential for the applicant to suffer irreparable harm (e.g. the loss of customers, market share) especially given that this is a small community. An interim injunction will only result in a delay of a few weeks. The interlocutory injunction is set to heard at the end of April. The stakes are higher for the applicant than they are for the respondent.","The plaintiff brought a motion for an interim injunction in order to prevent the defendant from operating a competing drug store within 10 miles of the plaintiff's business. The defendant had resigned from the company, leaving the plaintiff with only a few weeks to gather all the evidence it wished to present on an interlocutory motion. The plaintiff's motion was not frivolous or vexatious. There was a high potential for irreparable harm to the plaintiff company (the loss of customers, market share, though difficult to quantify, is real and is the type of harm contemplated by this branch of the test) and the balance of convenience favored the plaintiff. Interim injunction granted; the defendant is facing only the postponement of the opening for a couple of weeks; the stakes are much higher for the plaintiffs existing business (the plaintiff's existing drug store is already facing closure); and the plaintiff is facing the prospect of losing its small drug store business within weeks of its opening. The court was aware of the fact that the drug store was being considered by the former owner of the drugstore (the former manager of the defendant's company) and his business associates were leaving the company to join the new company. This created an urgency to issue an injunction as the new business was imminent and would have a profound effect on the existing business."

The court found that it had not shown that the defence was not filed and delivered within the time limited by the Rules and that the plaintiff had no reason for not having filed it. As the defendant had stated in his affidavit that he was not responsible for the car accident, the plaintiff's affidavit did not set out acts upon which in the words of Ives v.

At issue was whether the GiO cycle or moped which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code. The accused asserted that his GiO bike was operated that night by pedaling it as the electric motor was not working and asserted that driver's licence was not required to operate the GiO bike nor was he required to put licence plate on it. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges before the Court. There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle while disqualified. The issue before the court was whether the accused was pedaling his bike as his sole means of propulsion and whether the electric motor was operable. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges of driving while disqualified and failure to provide a breath sample. 1)The accused had been member of the Regina Police Service for four and one half years. He was on general patrol duty in his police vehicle which was proceeding westbound on Broad Street against a red light. As the police vehicle approached the intersection of Broad Street and Broad Street, they observed a driver on a moped enter the intersection against red light and proceed towards the intersection. The motor vehicle was not operating as defined by the Criminal Code and the accused should be acquitted of the impaired driving charge. 2)The police officer was not required to have a driver's licence. The accused had stated on numerous occasions that he would not blow into the mouthpiece of the intoxilizer device with sufficient force. The defence did not cross examine the officer. 3)There were some problems with the evidence of the police officer. The police officer gave the accused instructions on how to provide proper breath samples. However, on three separate occasions the accused blew his mouthpiece and did not provide a proper breath sample, the reason for the absence of such evidence was not explored in cross examination."

The accused had been in custody since November 2004. The defence requested a delay in the release of the accused from detention as there was a concern that the trial of these accused would take place within a year of the date when they were arrested. Although only 21 years of age, the accused had a significant youth court record; six convictions involving breaking and entering and theft, one for failing to comply with a disposition and recognizance, and one charge of being unlawfully at large.

e_2014skqb265.txt,The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving, contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and operating a motor vehicle when the concentration of alcohol in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, which resulted in breach of s. and s. of the Charter. The Crown appealed the acquittals of the accused and the acquitted accused. At issue was whether the trial judge erred in determining there were not reasonable grounds for the ASD demand on the accused. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1) The trial judge specifically found that the accused relied only on three factors in forming his suspicion. This is a finding of fact and there is no basis for disturbing it. 2) There is an element of reasonableness that cannot be tendered by an objective standard of review such as that of a reasonable person, placed in the shoes of a police officer, would not conclude on these facts that he had alcohol in your body at the time that he was stopped by the officer. As result, am not satisfied that Constable Kowalenko had the requisite reasonable suspicion to make an approved screening device demand."

A period of probation was appropriate but 3 years was out of proportion to the nature of the offence.

c_1998canlii14058.txt,"FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act. The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability. The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher. HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act. 2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver. The reasoning in Neault was directly on point. Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act. The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers. The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute. 4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer. The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals.","FIAT. The question is whether the defendant is liable for s. 86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries suffered by the infant plaintiff, or whether the co-defendant is immune from liability by s. 228 of The Education Act. HELD: 1)In the event the plaintiff is not liable, the defendant's liability extends to the owner of the motor vehicle. In the event Edith is immune then from liability the school board is not able to find in favour of the defendant. 2)The Education Act specifically provides an immunity to a teacher's liability when acting within the scope of s.228 of the Education Act and the immunity only applies to teachers and principals. 3)There is no apparent conflict between the statutes. The legislation provides that a negligent teacher/driver is granted immunity if the teacher has acted within its scope of duty. Even if there were an apparent conflict with the two statutes, careful analysis would lead one to conclude that the Highway/Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers of motor vehicles. The immunity only applied to the teacher and school board members."
5_2004skqb417.txt,"Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999. The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month. The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000. The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley. The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school. The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000. She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return. The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income. To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding. The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years. The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2) The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922. This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources. It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount. Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income. This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376. However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424. The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410. It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003. This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952. Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.  3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345. It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent. In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support. Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.  4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003. In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes. The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003. Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so. She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support. Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.  5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract. Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed. 6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted. No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment. Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year. The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7) In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410. Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8) The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","Each party applied for a variation of the 1999 child support judgment. The parties separated in 1997 and shortly thereafter the parties moved to Alberta. The 1999 judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract which provides for basic child support to be paid by the respondent in the amount of $1,411 per month. The respondent commenced negotiations in 2002 for a retroactive upward variation of child support. Negotiations proceeded slowly and the respondent ultimately countered with an application for variation in March 2004. HELD: 1)The guideline amount or some other amount should be used to calculate child support on an annual basis. Given the pattern of the respondent's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2002 that generated undisclosed cash flow and some two years later he nevertheless retains significant net assets. It is reasonable to impute additional income to the respondent for 2002. Based on the Guidelines and an annual income of $248,952, the respondent has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for the child than does the respondent. 2)The respondent has been awarded costs of this application."
d_1998canlii4665.txt,"The primary issue in this appeal was the standard of review to be applied on appeals from a Hearing Officer to the Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal. The appellant had his appeal denied on the grounds that the decision of the Hearing Officer was not patently unreasonable. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for re-hearing, that an appeal from a Hearing Officer to the Tribunal is a statutory appeal. It is not a judicial review, and the standard of review is therefore one of correctness not whether or not the Hearing Officer's decision was patently unreasonable. The deference that the Tribunal must show is only with respect to the advantages the Hearing Officer may have in the fact finding process of a particular case.",This was an appeal for which leave was granted from a Worker's Compensation Appeals Tribunal decision. It was limited to question as to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and to the extent that the Court could afford the usual appellate deference to trier of fact. This appeal was allowed and the matter was remitted to the Tribunal. There was no reason to think that the Tribunal is any less expert generally in matters relating to workers' compensation that fall within s. 243(7) than the hearing officer. The concept of patently unreasonable decision had no place in this statutory appeal process. The Tribunal has made an error of jurisdiction as to its powers on an appeal from the Hearing Officer.
3_1996canlii6732.txt,"The plaintiff sued his father's estate for breach of a farm lease and for the value of his farm labour. The estate counterclaimed for a mortgage debt incurred by the father on behalf of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not included in his father's Will as a beneficiary and the Will contained no reference to the mortgage debt. The father's statement of assets filed in his divorce and matrimonial property action did not disclose it as an asset. HELD: 1)The unsigned handwritten memorandum evidenced a binding agreement for lease between the plaintiff and his father. He affirmed the lease in his discussions with a daughter. 2)The plaintiff neither repudiated the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it.  The fact that he did not vigorously contest the right of his brother to farm the land on behalf of the estate did not estop him from suing for damages for his father's breach of the lease.  Damages of $6,500 were awarded. 3)The plaintiff failed to establish a quantum meruit claim. He did not produce any documents to show he had been reimbursed for his labour on the farm in prior years. Other family members helped with the farming from time to time. He did nothing while his father was alive to demand or obtain payment. 4)Even if the mortgage was considered a debt in 1989 it was subsequently forgiven. It was significant that the plaintiff was not included as a beneficiary and the amount of the mortgage was similar to the bequests to the other children. 5)The plaintiff was awarded his costs against the estate on a party and party basis for that portion of his claim on which he was successful and for defending the counterclaim. Solicitor and client costs against the estate were not appropriate as the issues raised by the claim and counterclaim were not typical estate issues. Judgment issued against the two executors in their representative capacity.","The plaintiff sues his father's estate for damages for breach of a farm lease and for a mortgage debt incurred by the deceased on behalf of the plaintiff. The issues raised by the claim and counterclaim are not typical 'estate' issues. HELD: 1)The plaintiff was only entitled to the net return he would have realized had he farmed the land in accordance with the lease in 1993. 2)The $17,800 mortgage (and interest) granted by the father to Farm Credit Corporation to clear his land from Bank of Montreal mortgage is not debt enforceable by the estate. Peter neither repudiated the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it.  2)In the circumstances the fact the plaintiff did not vigorouslycontest the right of his brother to farm the land on his behalf does not estop him from suing the estate fordamages for his breach of the lease. By his own conduct he did nothing to obtain payment for his labour while his father was alive. 3)The quantum of damages were $6,500.00 and the plaintiff was awarded costs on a party and party basis for that portion of his claim on which he was successful and for defending the counterclaim."
b_2016skpc86.txt,"HELD: The court found that the child was in need of protection under s. 11(b) of The Child and Family Services Act, that his parents were unable to care for him, and that physical or emotional harm was likely to occur to him. J.A.’s mother was found to be a person of sufficient interest under s. 23 of the Act. The court ordered that the child should be placed in the custody of J.A.’s mother as a person of sufficient interest for a period of four months pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act. The child’s parents should have adequate access to build their relationship with him and to allow them, with the assistance of others, to come up with a plan that would allow them to eventually care for their child.","The child was apprehended at birth by the Minister of Social Services but the Minister did not proceed with the application and the child was allowed to take home with her. The child had diminished cognitive abilities, as she suffers from FASD, and had challenges around understanding and retaining information, despite presenting as though this was not the case. The parents agreed that one of them would always be present to supervise the care of the child. After the apprehension, the child remained in need of protection and the Minister ordered that the child be placed in the grandmother's custody for a fixed period of 4 months, pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). This was a sad case as most proceedings under the Child and Family Services Act are. We have two very young parents who want to care for their infant. The issue is whether they are able to provide for this child's needs and if so, if physical or emotional harm is likely to occur to this six week old child. HELD: The child was placed in TK's custody as a person of sufficient interest for four months. That period is of shorter duration than the six months suggested in the Minister's report. Given the nature of the threats and the parents' failure to cooperate with them regarding when the baby was to be picked up, it is reasonable to conclude that the parents were not able to adequately care for the child and there was a risk of physical harm to the child if returned to them. The father was charged under s. 11(b). The parents were responsible for caring for the infant for most of the time. There was no suggestion that they were conspiring with or acting to help the father get custody of this child."
2_2006nsfc7.txt,"Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances. When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care. The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability. The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children. Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication.","The mother applied for a change in the primary care arrangements for two children. The father was currently employed as a roofer but was unable to drive a motor vehicle, having accumulated myriad of driving infractions to add to his already lengthy criminal record. The children were at considerable risk if placed in primary care and control of either parent. HELD: The primary care plan of the father was maintained for the children but with a change of primary care provision of the order, the children would be placed in the physical care of their mother. This would create an unfavorable factor for placement of the children with their father. The mother was motivated to be an effective parent but her past habit of consuming alcohol and drugs compromised her ability to provide adequate guidance to the children. As a result of the mother's and the father's inability to work, school, play, travel, and generally be a priority for the father, this creates a malaise which operates as a direct obstacle for the adequate provision of daily care by the mother."
2_2005skca127.txt,"The appellant appeared for his trial in a family law matter. He refused to participate and left. The judge ordered that the trial continue without him. A judgment was rendered, dividing the matrimonial property and dismissing the appellant's claim for maintenance. The appellant now appeals on the ground that the trial should not have proceeded without him. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) There is no error in the decision of the trial judge. The medical evidence did not indicate any inability to either instruct counsel or to represent him in Court. The trial judge had little choice but to do what she did. 2) The authorities cited by the appellant have no application to this case as they all deal with situations where someone did not appear at his trial. In this case, the appellant appeared but refused to participate. For the same reason, Queen's Bench Rule 271 has no application.","The appellant appeared for his trial in matrimonial matter after a peremptory adjournment. He refused to participate in the proceedings and the judge ordered that the trial proceed without him, although the judge did allow a friend to give evidence on his behalf. The trial judge dismissed the appellant's claim for maintenance. The appellant had been warned in writing that his health would be put into jeopardy by his attendance at trial. He had been given several accommodations by the court, including allowing his friend to sit with him, provision of written instructions on the conduct of trial by self-represented litigant, time for consultations and preparation during the trial, and private room for consultation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found no error in the decision of the trial judge. The medical opinions fell far short of justifying anything other than allowing someone else to represent the appellant, but the appellant had already demonstrated an inability to obtain the services of lawyer acceptable to him and the appellant declined to proceed with Mr. Hawke at his side."
b_2002nsca30.txt,"A fifteen year old died in a motor vehicle accident. The estate brought a claim for loss of future income and lost earning capacity. The Chambers judge found that such a claim was not available and the estate appealed. Appeal dismissed; the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.","Where a person is killed due to the fault of another, the person's estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in an actual pecuniary loss to the estate. The main question to be decided in this case is whether the earnings which the deceased would have likely have earned had he not been killed are 'an actual peculiary loss' and are, therefore, recoverable by the estate in an action against the Wrongdoer. For the purposes of this appeal, the Legislature has denied such a claim but has provided the deceased's dependants with a statutory cause of action for the lost financial support and other losses resulting from the wrongful death. Alternatively, the respondent argues that this claim is for loss of expectation of life and is not recoverable. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There has been no trial in this matter. The facts before the court are those agreed to by the parties for the limited purpose of resolving preliminary point of law. This is not an old statute that has been ignored by the Legislature in the many years since it was first enacted. The statute has been amended several times with respect to both the types of damages that are recoverable and the definition of the persons for whose benefit the action may be brought.  2) To succeed on their survival of actions claim for damages for Paul's lost earning capacity, the estate must have a cause or action which survives his death for the benefit of the estate and is enforceable as required by the Survival of Actions Act. The appellants rely on allegedly wrongful acts of the respondent for which the respondent could have sued had he been injured rather than killed. If the redress under that statutory cause is thought to be inadequate, the cure must be legislative, not judicial."

ISSUES: 1)Did Sedco register its interest in accordance with the PPSA Regulations? 2)If not, can the registration be cured under section 66 of the PPSA? HELD: 1)The personal registration did not comply with the PPSA Regulations. The registration against the trade name was proper. 2)This is a matter where section 66 should be applied.

The ground on which this application is brought is that the applicant’s security interest was not registered defectively, according to the Personal Property Security ActRegulations. In the alternative if the applicant has not properly registered its security interest the registration of the applicant against herself should be applied to remedy such defect. HELD: 1)To hold otherwise would result in an underserving windfall to unsecured creditors who have not been misled. 2)The applicant was the only secured party and the trustee had notice of the security interest which was validly registered. The applicant incurred risk by advancing credit and obtained a security interest and registered financing statement to protect its interest.  3)The trustee appeared late on the scene and has never incurred any risk.

2_2007nsca122.txt,"Two days after the wife commenced a divorce action in Nova Scotia, the husband commenced one in Texas. He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision. She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here. She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned. Application for stay pending appeal dismissed; the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here. Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there. Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20.","The appellant appeals from a stay of execution of an order setting aside her petition for divorce. On an application by the respondent to set aside the divorce petition on the basis that Nova Scotia lacked jurisdiction, the Supreme Court judge determined that the appellant had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least 1 year prior to the filing of the petition, as required by s.3 of the Divorce Act. The order sets out the history of the relationship between the parties and makes several findings of fact respecting the residence of the appellant during the marriage and for the year prior before the commencement of the divorce proceedings. As well an order releasing the respondent's interest in the Nova Scotia matrimonial property. HELD: The application for a stay pending appeal is dismissed. 1) Rule 62.15 has no application in this case because the decision of the respondent was merely declaratory and does not call for or contemplate any consequential relief or require the taking of any further steps to enforce his declaration. There simply are no 'proceedings under the order appealed from' to be stayed. 2) There is no comprehensive definition of 'exceptional circumstances' for Fulton's secondary test. It applies only when required in the interests of justice and it is exceptional in the sense that it permits the court to avoid an injustice in circumstances which escape the attention of the primary test. Here there are no proceedings that follow from the judgment of Campbell, J. which could be the subject of a stay. His decision is merely declarate as to the state of the law. There is nothing that has to be done to enforce or to give effect to the decision itself which has already been rendered. 3) The jurisdictional uncertainties and the child's best interests present exceptional circumstances. This is not a case where issuing a stay would prevent an injustice."

After calling the plaintiff several times to determine the market price for flax, the defendant agreed to sell the plaintiff 300 metric tonnes of flax of which 297.957 tonnes remain undelivered. HELD: 1) The defendant did not deliver the balance of the flax before August, 2001 or at anytime and he is in breach of the contract. 2) The verbal contract was in force from the time of the telephone conversation ended in June 2001. As the price rose, the plaintiff would have profited by $36.50 per tonne. That is the loss of profit that the plaintiff's claim is based on multiplied by 297.957 and totals $10,875.43. 3) The part performance involving the sale under the contract of 2.043 tonnes is sufficient to meet the requirements of The Sale of Goods Act.","The plaintiff is in the business of buying and selling grain.

However there was no suggestion of dishonesty. The combined medical earnings in the four years prior to the bankruptcy averaged $18,000 per month and the after-tax family income averaged $10,200 per month.

(b) to (m) but there had been no knowing dishonesty on the part of either of them.

2_2007nssc40.txt,"Following the collapse of the roofs of two buildings in Newfoundland, both of which were constructed with open web steel joists fabricated by the same company, the Nova Scotia government wrote to owners of buildings containing these joists, including the plaintiff mall owner, recommending that the joists be inspected by a qualified professional engineer. An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended. The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists. The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger. Judgment for the plaintiff; there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger. There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations.","The plaintiff obtained a number of open web steel joists from the respondent. The majority were found to have either one or more bent web members or were not compliant with the National Building Code. The plaintiff sought reimbursement for the inspection and remediation of the mall. The defendant, based in Sydney, claimed that the repairs were necessary but the reinforcing of the joists was not necessary to repair the defects. Awarding the plaintiff $7,000 for the remediation costs, that the respondents had not been properly trained in the welding trade and that the respondent had not conducted proper quality control. The court was concerned that the quality of the work performed by the respondent was not satisfactory and that necessary repairs were not being undertaken to alleviate the danger. Regarding the respondent's claim, that respondents had been instructed to deslocate the joist line when no approved weld data sheets were produced, to allow the examination of the welds and to determine the mode of failure. The respondent was also required to pay for remediation efforts undertaken by the defendant."

The applicant commenced an application pursuant to s.19 of The Controverted Municipal Elections Act following the municipal election for mayor and counsellors. The municipal election was held October 22, 1997. The issue was whether the application should be brought within 6 weeks after an election. Counsel for the respondents argued the application was over the time limit because the time did not commence until after completion of the judicial recount provided by s.126-128 of the Local Government Election Act. HELD: The application was brought before the Chambers judge on December 8, 1997 and the service of the notice of motion was made within 2 weeks of the date of the fiat.

Tuckey, [1975] W.W.R. 191 (Alta D.C.) in support of the proposition that the election means the voting and completion of counting. The legislation is clear. Section 103 of the Saskatchewan Act states that a fiat was granted forty-seven days later than a prescribed date.

In the resulting reorganization two new corporations, each acquired several pig barns formerly owned by the respondent defendant. The acquisitions were financed for the purchasers by Farm Credit Canada (FCC), as primary lender, and National Bank of Canada (National). There may have been other sources of acquisition funding. The plaintiff applied to strike portions of the statement of defence in foreclosure action. Specifically in issue was whether the defendant was entitled to plead equitable set-off. National opposed the application on the basis that the defendant's cross-claim was so closely connected with the plaintiff's demand that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking the defendant’s cross--claim into consideration. HELD: Both applications were dismissed. Although the facts and circumstances in each case were virtually identical, the complexity of them made it appropriate that each defendant recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff.  1) The pleadings should only be struck pursuant to Rule 173 in cases where it is obvious that the claim or defence is devoid of all merit or cannot possibly succeed. Such jurisdiction should be exercised sparingly and only in very exceptional cases. 2) The term 'abuse of process' is often used interchangeably with the terms 'frivolous' or'vexatious' either separately or more usually in conjunction with Rule 173(a). There was no reference in the HTP conditions to mortgagees. The purpose of the statements of defence is to delay the FCC foreclosure actions without having to meet the more stringent requirements for injunctive relief. It follows that where an abuse of process has taken place, the intervention of the court by the stay or even dismissal of proceedings, although it should not be lightly done, yet it may often be required by the very essence of justice to be done. 3) National has raised reasonable defences including breach by FCC of collateral contracts which are clearly connected to the mortgages, together with equitable estoppel which precludes enforcement in circumstances such as the present; and National has the right to defend the actions because of its interest in the equity of redemption."

Following discovery examinations, the great niece, who was the alternative executor appointed under the will, applied to have the executor, the deceased's husband, removed on the basis that his discovery evidence raised grave concerns about his mental capacity to continue to act as executor. Application to remove the executor dismissed; there was no medical evidence submitted in support of the applicant's claim that the executor was not competent to administer the estate and although it was clear from the discovery evidence that he did not have a clear understanding of his duties as executor, given that he was the only beneficiary under the will, he was the only person whose interest was at risk if he failed to properly administer the estate.","The applicant, a niece of the testator, applied for an order removing the executor of her will. The deceased was the alternate executor. The applicant had difficulties with vision and hearing and clearly had difficulty comprehending and responding coherently to the questions asked on discovery. She claimed that her niece was the only person whose interest was at risk if he failed to properly administer the estate. The executor had no clear understanding of the proceeding or his position as executor and appeared to have a weak grasp of how they were dealt with. The niece argued that there is no basis upon which to remove the present executor if he is not capable of supervising the affairs of the estate or if he has no idea of the investments and activities of Mr. Conrod, a third party. HELD: Application dismissed. 1) The applicant was 99 years old and had difficulty with eyesight and hearing. He spoke very little English and could not recall many details of his daily routine. He appeared very confused most of the time. His wife was very secretive and possessive with respect to her bank shares. She therefore was not qualified to carry out her duties under the Act.  2) There was no medical evidence submitted in support of the applicant's claim that the deceased was not competent to administer the will. There was contrary evidence submitted by the estate in the affidavits of Ms. Brooks and Mr. Finlayson. However, it is my view that, although the deceased has some recollection of certain events and is not able to instruct counsel in the circumstances, based on all the evidence, that he has sufficient presence of mind to instruct. 3) The application to remove an executor is dismissed."

2006skqb536.txt,"The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf. The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit. A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction. The guarantee was supplied by the defendant Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers. The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services. The plaintiff was first approached to become a potential customer. In the transitional period, the contractual negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendants generated two standard form agreements, a preliminary 'LeBlanc' contract dated December 2003 and a subsequent 'Ritchie Bros.' contract dated March 28 2004. Both parties refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendants declared its guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the Contract to Auction and charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds of sale. HELD: While a number of issues require exploration in the present case, the preeminent issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserve auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. 1) The case has much to do with the unique nature of 'unreserved auctions', where goods are sold to the highest bidder and the owner is precluded from affecting sale prices either by the use of reserve bids or through involvement, directly or indirectly in the bidding process. 2) There are indications that the plaintiff did not feel inescapably bound to contract with the defendants at that point in time. The defendants proceeded to advertise the sale extensively, taking out ads in three provinces and in the northern United States, preparing thousands of catalogues for mass distribution, and directly delivering 1,500 posters to farm yards and mail boxes in Melfort and area. 3) In the initial discussions with the plaintiff prior to the auction, the plaintiff was told that the defendants would do everything in preparation for the sale and could cut him a cheque at the end of the sale for guaranteed amount. He was not expected to do nothing. He could not have represented that as a concrete offer from them at any time prior to December 23 because it simply did not exist. It might be inferred from this course of conduct that the defendant was continuing to explore more lucrative opportunities after December 23, 2003, notwithstanding his assertion that the entire contract between the parties was formed in December 2003. 4) Lorne Campbell, the principal shareholder and operating mind of plaintiff, was planning to exit farming after more than 30 years involvement. The defendant, based in Canada, was looking to establish itself as a regional presence. Hodgins Auction"
7_1997canlii11172.txt,"An application pursuant to s232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for a determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada had sought disclosure. The applicants were husband and wife, their two sons and the companies in which they were principal shareholders and/or directors. The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions. The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm. At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties. HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld. 2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction. One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.  3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor. Recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the circumstances necessary to found the requisite relationship of agency. 7)The accountants were clearly acting as agents for the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, as was found in Susan Hosiery. They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of and on instructions of the applicants. 8)Solicitor-client privilege extended to items of accounting information obtained for the purpose of receiving legal advice. Notes prepared by the accountant and the interoffice communications summarizing discussions with the solicitor also fell within the scope of privilege.","This was an application pursuant to s. 232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for the determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada has sought disclosure. The individual applicants were husband, wife, accountant and two adult sons who were principal shareholders and directors of the corporate applicants. The corporate applicants were corporations in which various of the individual applicants are principal shareholders or directors. The documents at issue were originally in the possession of the Melfort office of the accounting firm which had acted as an accounting firm for all of the period at issue. HELD: 1) The accountant was clearly acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking, receiving, or implementing legal advice from the applicant. 2) The letter and copy of the same letter were to be sent to the applicant's solicitor. 3) An inventory describing each document was filed with the applicants' brief of law as 'Schedule A'.  4) The respondent took the position that the accountants were acting as agents for the client. The accountant's role in relation to the subsequent communication with the applicant was clearly one of being a representative to the client and not a solicitor. 5) There was no privileged relationship between the accountant and the applicant for the purposes of obtaining legal advice. The only privileged relationship was with respect to the memoranda prepared by the applicants for review by the auditors. 6) Correspondence and cooperation was between the applicants and their accountants. 7) There were no special privileges conferred on the accountant except for the privilege against producing a memorandum of what occurred at that meeting. 8) The privileged privilege conferred only on the respondents and did not extend to the accountsant. 9) The only privilege conferred was on the accountant for providing legal advice to the applicants. 10) The solicitor's privilege was limited to providing evidence as to the contents of the documents and to answering any questions as to what was or was not in the memorandum. The proper forum for this privilege was in the context of communications between the client's lawyer and its accountant.  10) Counsel for the respondent in this case argued that the auditor should be distinguished because he was acting as representative, or agent, of the clients and his role was to perfect the legal advice given by the client to the clients. 11) It was also held that the accountant's privilege extended to include any documents that were not prepared for the accountant. 12) The information contained in the notes was not privileged. 13) The"

The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation. The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife. The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle. The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused. A knife was also located in the yard. A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court. The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers. The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident. He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to. He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out. The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them. He said that he did not intend to stab them. At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not. The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle. The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode. The accused raised the issue of self-defence. HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him. The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires. The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect. The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused. The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer. The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat. The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence. The accused was found guilty as charged.","The accused was charged with assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling with a companion when he was confronted by the accused, who was armed with a knife. The confrontation escalated to the point where the accused threw the knife at the complainant, who ran towards the vehicle, chased after him, and slashed the complainant's tire, and then ran towards his vehicle. The complainant was injured in the confrontation with the accused and the knife was found in his hand. The Crown called five witnesses who gave evidence at trial who testified that the accused said words to the effect of 'Get the fuck out of my face or I'll beat the fucking out of you' to the complainant. HELD: The accused is guilty of assault. The nature of the force or threat that was presented by the size of the complainant and the words used by the defendant were not of a nature that would warrant, as reasonable, the action subsequently taken by the complainant against the accused.  1) The accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to him and in very close quarters, as the complainant himself testified, getting into his personal space.  2) The Crown established that the offence charged occurred on the date and at the location alleged in the indictment and that the butcher knife entered as Exhibit P1 is clearly a weapon as defined by s. 2 of the Code. Where the accused clearly stated that the person he was trying to intimidate was not alone, no physical force was actually used against the complainant that would support a reasonable conclusion that the defendant's use of force was imminent or posed a threat to the appellant. There was no history between these individuals as contemplated by ss.34(2)(f), (f.1) and (h) apply."

Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence. The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence. The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB. _____ HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed. The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance. If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue. There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented. 3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence. The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data. The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects. He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours. 4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76. The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.  5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary.","A cardiologist appeals an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee that he repay $207,821.03 in medical fees he received from the Medical Care Insurance Branch. The appeal is brought under s.49.21(1) of the Saskatchewan Medical Care insurance Act. HELD: 1) The Committee failed to provide adequate reasons for its decision. 2) It was reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the involvement of the Director of Professional Review in the hearing conducted by the Committee. The Committee made errors of law by improperly placing the burden of proof on the cardiologist and by failing to take into account all relevant factors (i.e. its statistical analysis was more reliable than thestatistical analysis presented by MCIB); the Committee used and relied on the opinion of the director of professional review in preference to the Committee's and uncontroverted expert evidence. 3) There was an inherent misunderstanding of the role of the Committee in determining the best cardiologist in Saskatchewan could be put forward for judicial review. It is trite law that the rules of natural justice impose their consequences upon those who wish to participate in such a review. 4) There is no institutional bias in the decision making process. It has not been established that institutional bias raised the issue of institutional bias. 5) There has been a substantial change in the medical practice culture in Saskatchewan from the days leading up to the date of the appointment of this judge."
5_2006nssc353.txt,"The claimant flooring dealer had supplied and installed a large amount of flooring in the defendant's new home. Although the defendant had visited the claimant's store and selected the flooring, the actual purchase was made by the defendant's contractor who did not pay the claimant and had now declared bankruptcy. The adjudicator found that although the three criteria for an unjust enrichment claim had been met, there was no special relationship between the parties and thus, denied the claim. The claimant appealed. Appeal allowed; the absence of a special relationship will not automatically defeat a claim of unjust enrichment; the Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment claims.","During the construction of Dr. Paul Joseph's home by the respondent company, which contracted for flooring material from the appellant company, Jollymore contracted for the material as well as the services of subcontractors. There was no direct contact between the Appellant and the wife, and the purchasing of all the material was left up to Jollymore who dealt with the flooring manager. The goods were invoiced to Maritime and delivered to the respondent's home. During the construction process, it became apparent that some of the subcontractors were not paid by Jollymore or Maritime and the plaintiff did not receive satisfactory explanation from Jollymore as to where the money went. The flooring remained in the applicant's home, but the application for compensation was dismissed. The presence of a special relationship will not necessarily defeat a claim. After examining the evidence, it was concluded that there was a 'casual arrangement' between the parties, frequently contractual at the outset, which relationship would have made it unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit conferred on him by the plaintiff benefit, be it formally or an unenforceable contract. This relationship in turn is usually, but not always, marked by two characteristics, firstly knowledge of the benefit on the part of the defendant, and secondly, either an express or implied request by the defendant for the benefit, or acquiescence in its performance. In almost all of the cases, cited here by counsel in which the plaintiffs have succeeded, it is the essential nexus between the defendants' words and conduct and the plaintiffs conferring of the benefits. The same is not true in this case as Joseph was unaware that the work had been performed, and so it was held that no special relationship existed."
8_2005skca120.txt,"The deceased made a Will appointing her only son, the appellant, as executor. In her Will, she left her home to her son, and divided the rest and residue between her two daughters, the respondents. The deceased transferred title to her house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly. She also transferred some bank deposits totalling approximately $57,000 into the joint names of herself and the appellant and designated him as the person entitled to receive payments under a RRIF totalling approximately $29,000. After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself. He paid out about $45,000 to the grandchildren and himself, but nothing to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries under the Will. The sisters brought action against him, claiming the funds were part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect against him. He appeals against that judgment. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs.  1) Section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act does not apply to this case. 2) The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and the law respecting the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust. The judge did not mention the possibility of and express trust in favour of the grandchildren. She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact. Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate. In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust. In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis. Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate. 3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error.  4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren. The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased. The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him. The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee. The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence","Respondents: When the respondent mother died in 1999, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the will but were given to him for the benefit of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The appellant paid about $45,000 to his sisters as well as obtained a judgment to that effect as well a judgment against the appellant for the amounts they, as the residuary beneficiaries, should have received. This appeal was against that judgment. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error and the judge made no such error. There is nothing more than the lack of consideration and the fact that the appellant knew from the outset that the respondents disagreed with the position taken by him and intended to take proceedings against him. Therefore, the trial judge did not err in law in disposing of the evidence that the respondent intended the funds to be given to the beneficiaries."

2_2007nssc235.txt,"The parties, divorced, had children, aged 23, 19, and 14 years, respectively. The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support. The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment. The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed. Both parties applied to vary child support. The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school. Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses. The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies. The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months. Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years. The father will pay 25 per cent of the core university costs which are not covered by the plan for the middle child as well as the difference in the Table amount of support for two children versus one child; the father shall pay the Table amount of support for one child to the wife for the youngest child as well as that child's expenses for private school; the wife will be responsible for any extra-curricular activities or tutoring outside the private school; the youngest child will be entitled to the same post-secondary benefits in the same fashion as the two older children; the CRJ is amended to provide that the two oldest children are in the joint care of their parents and will not include any other reference to custody or access; the husband is entitled to specified block access with the youngest child; if flight arrangements are made for this child and she does not fly (and there is no medical reason confirmed in writing by a doctor for that failure), the husband's block access shall be expanded for one week at the next access period and the cost of any penalty from the missed flight will be deducted dollar for dollar from the child support payable by the husband.","The parties brought a number of variation applications under the Divorce Act. They each brought a variation application under the Corollary Relief Judgment, which provided that the husband would pay child support of $3,350 per month until the wife graduated from the M.B.A. program, which was established when each of the children were born. The requirement for the husband to pay William's educational expenses was conditional upon the wife having finished her course work in December 2005 (six months before the spousal support order ended) and having him available for employment within months of that order. The husband argued that the change in circumstances related to the marriage would have resulted in a different order of support if it had been known at the time of the original order. Application dismissed. The mother had made a series of cross-applications regarding child support. In 2005, the husband ordered that the three children remain in the mother's care and that any reimbursement due from the father's employment as result of the payment of private school fees shall be retained by the mother. In 2006, the mother ordered that all the children's school fees be paid directly to the husband, with an appropriate adjustment to the payment to both the husband's children. In 2007, the wife was awarded $1,000 per month in child support payable. This amount was reduced to $592 per month and reduced by $2,958 per month. The 2008 child support was subject to the same exchange adjustment as the one made in January 2007."
8_2013skqb403.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. With respect to the issues, the Court found: 1) that the board had not relied upon the clause in the Policy Statement but on the evidence before it. It was not necessary to decide then whether the Policy Statement was ultra vires; 2) that the board’s interpretation that the Act granted discretion to the board to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment was reasonable; 3) that the board’s conclusion was reasonable. The scientific studies did not definitively stated that medical marijuana was effective. In some situations where a patient’s only recourse would to be to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy was still questioned, a determination that the medical aid was not necessary or required might be unreasonable, but not in this case where the applicant declined to try Sativex; and 4) that there was no evidence that the board based its decision on irrelevant considerations such as the potential political ramifications of paying for medical marijuana.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The Board's decision to deny reimbursement was reasonable and within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes. There was no evidence that the Board relied on policy statement 5 or even mention it in reaching its decision. Even if Policy Statement was ultra vires, it does not decide this matter. It is not necessary to decide whether Policy Statement 5 is ultra viring. 1) Based on the wording of the Act and the context of the relevant provisions, the Board's interpretation that the Act granted the Board discretion to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment is reasonable. 2) It is reasonable that a determination that medical marijuana is not proven and therefore not 'necessary or required' is reasonable when one considers the availability of Sativex. However, it is within range of acceptable outcomes and is not the only reasonable interpretation. 3) The Board did not rely on a blanket prohibition to deny the reimbursement of medical marijuana. Rather, it based its decision on the evidence before it. There is no evidence before the Board that the benefits and safety of medical marihuana have not been established to the point that it is 'necessary' or'required' under s. 106(1)(a) or that this conclusion is supported by research and is all the more reasonable when considering alternative medication. medical marijuana has worked for the plaintiff for 10 years and has been recommended by an expert doctor. The only reason the Board has granted reimbursement is based on medical research. Medical marijuana is potentially unsafe and unproven. If the Board had authority to refuse reimbursement for such reasons, there is no improper purpose.  4) The applicant took the position the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in enacting Policy Statement of POL 10/2011 pursuant to its exclusive jurisdiction granted by s. 22(1) to the Board of Directors to determine all matters in questions arising under the Act. In the end result, the application is dismissed."
e_2009skpc9.txt,"The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants. The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners. This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned. Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions.","The Plaintiffs claim $6,700.77 against the Defendant for water damage sustained while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin, Saskatchewan in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the Defendant.

HELD: 1) Whether the Plaintiffs are precluded from recovery by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment was water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimer. 2) Quantum of damages and mitigation. The defendant was found to be only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiffs' possessions in all the circumstances. In all, the defendant was only 20 percent responsible for $250.00 in damages.  3) The Court assessed the damages at $200.00. 4) The court found that the damage was purely cosmetic with no discernible functional damage whatsoever. No stains were shown or explained to him and he simply drove off the lot, no doubt in rush because he was now several hours behind schedule. No attempt was made to have the items professionally cleaned. In the circumstances, the court assesses damages totalling $250,000."

He informed the court that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined.

e_2016skpc157.txt,"HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice. The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it; and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained. However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately. The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code.","HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration of alcohol in her blood exceeded 80 milligrams. The accused had no difficulty walking or talking and there was no evidence of her drinking prior to the demand. The police officer essentially decided that he had the reasonable suspicion to make the demand, he came to that conclusion without taking the time to properly ascertain the indicia of impairment. Within 45 seconds of coming upon the accused, the police officer made the demand and she provided a suitable sample. This delay was not satisfactory to the accused and prejudiced her. The need to take the tests as soon as practicable is to ensure that the accused's blood alcohol content was as accurate as possible at the time of driving.

Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile. The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year. Although the wife did not establish any disadvantage from the marriage, there were disadvantages relating to its breakdown and her lifestyle deteriorated as result of the marriage ending.","The parties were married for ten years and had entered into a Separation Agreement in 2001. The husband petitioned for divorce in June 2003. The wife, who had received one-half of the proceeds of the sale of the matrimonial home, filed an Answer in September 2003. She alleged that the husband had failed to provide her with an automobile for the past year. The parties lived separate and apart for more than a year prior to the divorce. The issues were: 1) spousal support; 2) whether the husband should continue to pay it retroactive to the date he ceased paying it; 3) whether his personal circumstances required such support; 4) whether it was necessary to continue the marriage to a point where it became economically self-sufficient. The evidence supported a conclusion it was agreed to be only for one year; 5) the wife's financial situation clearly demonstrated her need for such support to continue. Although the husband acknowledged that he provided the wife with a mid-sized motor vehicle for her own exclusive use and ownership free and clear from any claim by the husband; and 6) that his financial situation was such that he could not continue to provide such support. It was under these conditions that the wife was given an automobile. She purchased one in the husband's name and drove it for about a year before it broke down and she had to buy a second vehicle. She was employed as a waitress when the marriage broke down. She now owned a 1992 Suburban. This vehicle was now owned by his company and remained registered in his name. She indicated that it may have had more hours available to her than she actually worked, but there was no evidence to substantiate these claims or indicate how they would prevent her from working full time. She claimed that she had advanced money to the husband during the course of the marriage, but claimed that it was from a secure source and available only to her. She also claimed that he had advanced the money to her by placing it in her name and that she was able to earn more income by working longer hours. She did not establish any disadvantages arising from the marriage as a result of the separation, but rather believed that the financial situation had worsened to the extent that it should continue for an indefinite period of time and that her financial needs and needs did require such support.(HELD): 1) The parties agreed the 2008 separation agreement should be reviewed and terminated.

The Court ordered that the children primarily reside in La Ronge with the petitioner and attend school there. The Court also ordered specified access for the respondent.","FIAT: Further to the hearing on May 7, 2013, the issue is whether the children are to be relocated from La Ronge to live with the respondent in Melville, Saskatchewan. HELD: 1) The parties had a verbal co-parenting arrangement for some time. This arrangement was in place from January 2011 until April 2013 when the respondent unilaterally relocated the children to Melville. The parties were to be joint custodial parents for the two boys.  2) The preservation of the status quo is in the best interests of the boys. Therefore, the boys are to reside in LaRonge or Air Ronge, Saskatchewan and attend school there while residing with the petitioner. 3) There is no risk for the children in the care of either the petitioner or the respondent.  4) There has been numerous decisions of the courts on the issue of interim parenting of children. These principles were set out by Laing J. in Guenther (1999) 1999 CanLII 12554 (Q.B.). 5) The case law provides that significant caution is necessary when deciding whether custodial parent should be allowed to move with child on an interim basis, i.e. before trial of the relevant issues. This is so because an interim change of location can all too easily be a disruption to the child's best interests."

The father applied to have the mother cited for contempt for denial of access. By fiat of October 4, 2002, Matheson J. transferred custody to the father and directed the mother to give viva voce evidence in response to the allegation of contempt. The specific grounds for this application were that the respondent deliberately denied access and intentionally refused to comply with the access provisions contained in paragraph 4(d) of the Judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice J.R.O. Archambault. HELD: The father's application was dismissed. 1)The court cannot ignore the best interests of the child and neither fine nor imprisonment should be ordered unless consistent with those best interests. The additional sanction now sought is of dubious merit. 2)The father was to have custody transferred to the mother. The mother was to file a certificate of completion within sixty days. 3)Costs will remain in the cause."
d_2017skqb42.txt,"HELD: The action was allowed. The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000. The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced. It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages.","HELD: The plaintiff was found not liable. The court found that the defendants, acting alone or in concert, published defamatory comments about the plaintiff in a series of articles published on newspapers and websites. The plaintiff did not file any complaints with the hospital or any of the defendants until the very last day of her trial, which was at which point she went into cardiac arrest and had to be amputated. The articles caused irreparable damage to the plaintiff’s reputation and it was hoped that they would eventually be added as a defendant. The defendants opposed this application on the basis that the two-year limitation period set forth in The Limitations Act in force at the time of the alleged defamation had expired and there was no evidentiary basis upon which could conclude that no party would suffer actual prejudice as result of the requested amendment."
e_2014skqb344.txt,"The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi. It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price. Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000. If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs. Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff. Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application. All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful.","The plaintiff applied for an order nisi for judicial sale of the property owned by the defendants. The Limitation of Civil Rights Act does not preclude the plaintiff from suing on the covenant because this is not a purchase-money mortgage. However, a judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency set by the court. Otherwise, as provided by s. of the LCRA, foreclosure of the mortgage operates as full satisfaction of that debt. HELD: The application to confirm the sale must be brought by notice of application. The draft order sets out the proposal for disbursing the purchase monies. The proposed selling officer ought not to be the plaintiff's own counsel."

The creditor objected that the applicant had plenty of opportunity over the years to pay and drew attention to prior allegations of mismanagement or redirection of funds which should have been allocated to the payment of interest. HELD: The payment which should have been paid in November was to be paid within 7 days. The remaining payments set out in the schedule will commence January 2001 with the change in rate of interest from that provided under the Interest Act to one equivalent to pre-judgment interest. A 5 day grace period was allowed after which the respondent was allowed to proceed immediately with enforcement by execution, garnishment or any means it deems appropriate. The taxed cost of this application was added to the judgment and will be part of the balance to be paid on May 1, 2001. Counsel could apply for further directions.","FIAT. 598772 Saskatchewan Ltd. applied for relief pursuant to s. 81(1) of the Queen's Bench Act, 1998. That allows the Court to direct that a judgment will be paid by instalments and/or over a period of time where it is demonstrated that the judgment debtor requires such relief. HELD: The judgment was granted. It will be granted on the basis outlined in the proposed settlement commencing with a payment to be made within 7 days which would have been paid November 1, 2000. The remaining payments set out in the schedule will follow thereafter continuing with January 1, 2001. An officer of the applicant swore that the officers were prepared to infuse $100,000 into the company's treasury if need be to make up any shortfall from funds needed by the company to pay the instalmentments.

8_2014skqb299.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness. Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly. Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public. The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past. The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout. To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn. The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable.","The parties disagreed on the standard of review to be applied to the arbitrator's interpretation of s. 51 of the Act. The University's position was that the president exceeded his jurisdiction, made an unreasonable decision, or committed an otherwise reviewable error of law by misinterpreting portions of the University of Saskatchewan Act and the Act, particularly Section 51. 2. The Arbitrator failed to apply principles/doctrines of statutory interpretation, including the context and purpose of the legislation, the doctrine of presumed intent of the legislature, the contextual approach and the doctrine that the interpretation should not produce an absurd result. Both parties relied on dicta from Dunsmuir in support of their submissions. HELD: 1)An award of tenure is neither an appointment nor promotion as contemplated by the Act nor the collective agreement. The right to grieve a decision on tenure was only permitted under the agreement when the Board reversed a decision of one of the committees. The review decision left open whether the Board was bound by the president's recommendation or by the Agreement. 2)The Arbitrator found after reviewing the Saskatchewan Act, its provisions, and the Tenure Appeals Committee decision as if the same had been transmitted to them by the President in accordance with the terms of the agreement. He found that the Board may never grant person tenure unless and until they are 'nominated for the appointment' or'recommended for the promotion'. 3)The parties agreed to a lengthy statement of facts and the admissibility of number of documents.  4)The dispute arose as a result of a dispute between the parties concerning the awarding of tenure and whether the president had the authority to appoint or promote a faculty member pursuant to the Agreement or, alternatively, whether it was an appointment or promotion within the meaning of that Act.  5)It was agreed that the parties would have to deliberate on whether the Act requires the president to appoint someone to a permanent position on the academic staff of the university or whether it is a power to be exercised within parameters set by the Board, which includes collective bargaining. The arbitration decision dealt with whether a person can be appointed as a probationary assistant professor if that person has been nominated for the position by a president; if not that their employment expires at the end of a fixed term. 6)The arbitration decision was appealed. The parties agreed that a review of the decision would be necessary to determine whether a tenure award or promotion was appropriate under the circumstances of the time and place they were appointed."
9_2005skca89.txt,"This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act. The couple had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property. The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents. The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents. The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority. Lane J.A. wrote in dissent. Majority: 1) The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship. The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act. There are a number of facts that merit emphasis. The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started. He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced. He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced. By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000. 2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property. There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point. The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete. He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act. On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property. The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage. Minority: 1) The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act. The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together. In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2) The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents. He made a finding the loans were statute-barred. The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent. He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid. He simply used less than precise language.","This appeal stems from proceedings under The Family Property Act, initiated by Deborah Ruskin, a nurse, against Leith Dewar, a doctor. The two had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property or its value equally between them. The trial judge held that the parties had become'spouses' within the meaning of the Act in early June 1994 and then went to hold that the appellant was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gift or loans. With that appeal, Dr. Dewar appealed. He argued the value of the house was exempt from distribution because it was acquired after the commencement of the spousal relationship, not before? Alternatively, he contended the gift and loans served to reduce the value available for distribution. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) This appeal is the equivalent of Mitchell v. Mitchell. Apart from being statute barred, the Act requires confirmation to be in writing and nothing has been produced. It has now been approximately 9 years. While Leith's income when he purchased the home was perhaps unexceptional, he has had substantial income for the last number of years and made no payments.  2) The Court considered the equivalent to Mitchell v.'s equivalent of the Mitchell case in which Mitchell was held to have been misapplied. It is not in light of the equitable considerations mentioned in s. 23(1)(a) and s. 21(2)(a), but rather supported by the evidence as to preclude interference on appeal.  3) In this case, the trial judge erred in concluding that the values of the Vancouver house and its value fell to be exempt in distribution because the property had been acquired after commencing spousals. It follows that the property did not qualify for an exemption under s23(1(a). 4) The parties cohabitated with one another continuously for 2 years. This relationship was governed by s22 rather than s21 and 23. The significance of this case is that the fact as found is sufficient in law to render the relationship between the parties spouse, effective as of late June 1994 as contemplated by the definition of'spouse' found in section 23.5.  5) The court reviewed the relevant provisions of s23 and called for consideration of whether the exemption ought to be disallowed. 6) The issues were: 1) whether the trial court erred by failing to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant had obtained from his parents for the purpose of purchasing the"
4_2011skpc127.txt,"The Ministry brought an application for a permanent order for the child pursuant to s. 37 of The Child and Family Services Act. The Minister apprehended the child at birth. The mother's three older children had been apprehended with two other older children placed with a person of sufficient interest and the third child was made a permanent ward of the Ministry. The Minister argued that given the extensive past history of the three older children, the Minister properly apprehended the infant and the permanency planning committee was of the opinion that there was no use putting off the inevitable permanent order for the child. The mother and the child's father had separated with the father supporting the mother having the child returned to her care and the father having access to the child. HELD: There was no basis for the initial apprehension as the child was not in need of protection. The child shall be returned to the mother who is a person who has a right of custody of the child pursuant to s. 36(3) of the Child and Family Services Act. This shall be done on a transitional basis as determined by the Ministry with the child to be completely returned to the mother within 30 days of this order. There was no evidence presented at trial regarding attempts by the Ministry to pursue any less intrusive alternatives and instead proceeded directly to the most severe position being a permanent order. The evidence did not justify the Ministry's position.","The Ministry brings an application for a permanent order for the child, T.J.E.S., born April 19, 2010, pursuant to s. 37 of The Child and Family Services Act. The biological parents, M.S. and P.K., oppose the application and submit the child should be returned to the mother. HELD: 1) The child is in need of protection and the Ministry has no legal authority to force a parent to do anything if there is no basis for apprehension. The Court must look at various factors including (without meaning to be exhaustive of the possibilities) any changes in circumstance or conduct of the parent that has occurred or is proposed, any plan of corrective action that is being advanced, the nature of any resources suggested and the time frames which may be involved. 2) There must be a reasonable prospect of change, within a reasonable length of time and reasonable use of resources if needed. Where, as here, children have been placed into the temporary custody of the Minister, and the parents wish to have the children returned to them, they must make efforts to improve or remove the conditions or circumstances in the home which have resulted in the children being taken from the parents. This analysis is supported by the Saskatoon Court of Appeal in S.F. (Re), 2009 SKCA 121 (CanLII). 3) In making an order under s. 11 of the Act, the court must do so on the basis of the evidence before it. The burden is on the Ministry to establish its case on the balance of probabilities being the civil burden of proof."
1993canlii3174.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards. The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children. Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home. The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal. The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final. Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order, that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected. There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision. The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases. To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties. Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period. The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","This was an appeal from a decision in Hall, L.J.S.C. reducing the appellant's support from $2,000 to $1200 per month. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)While there had been a radical change in the wife's circumstances, there was no link between the change in circumstances and the marriage. The appellant recognized her obligation to contribute to her own support and continued her efforts to find employment. 2)Plelech does not deprive the courts of ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support. It is expressly agreed by the parties that this settlement constitutes a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. 3)The principles of Pelech should not be used to restrict the application and purposes of s.17 of the Divorce Act. Where a person has negotiated their own agreement, freely and on the advice of independent legal counsel, as to how their financial affairs should be settled, the Court may exercise its relieving power. 4)The appellant had established that substantial variations in the income of the husband self-employed business man could occur. Such changes in this context could not be considered radical unless they were permanent or substantially long-standing. There was truly finality to the agreement."
c_2016skqb293.txt,"HELD: The appeal was granted on the basis of the first two grounds as well as others. The court quashed the tribunal’s decision and reinstated the appellant’s hospital privileges. The court reviewed the transcript of the tribunal’s hearing and its written decision. With regard to the first two issues, it found that the tribunal had erred in law in the following ways: 1) by failing to conduct a de novo hearing as required. It did not refer to the expert opinion submitted by the appellant as new evidence at the hearing; and 2) by failing to explain its decision. It did not refer to the new evidence nor did it state how it had reconciled the conflicting expert opinion evidence offered by the appellant and the respondent. It merely accepted the evidence of the SMO’s experts.","The medical doctor appeals from decision of the Practitioner Staff Appeals Tribunal (Tribunal). The original suspension was done wrongfully and precipitously, and ultimately the Tribunal made fatal errors when dealing with this matter pursuant to statutory appeal. The appellant's evidence is that all options were reviewed with CC, who elected to pursue a particular course of treatment. This was done appropriately, as during the treatment of the uterine rupture, requiring remedial steps to safeguard the mother's welfare. The respondent operates health care facilities including hospitals including the appellant's. To do so, those doctors must first obtain privileges under the respondent's Bylaws, which require every health authority to make a bylaw governing the practitioner staff covering, inter alia, privileges and the matters in issue in the within appeals. The s. 45 appeal to tribunal is a de novo appeal hearing. It is not an appeal on the record. Curial deference is not owed and the tribunal may (indeed, must) take its own view of the evidence put before it and is not bound by the views of the Board. HELD: The Court finds that the Tribunal erred in finding that the appellant met the standard of care and that the errors lead to the granting of a remedy to the appellant, that of quashing the Tribunal's decision and full reinstatement of his privileges.  1) This case cannot be taken to be supportive of the suspension of the SMO. 2) There is no real nexus between this rare condition and other situations Dr. Abouhamra was called upon to manage in the course of his ob/gyn practice. The evidence from the Board and Tribunal is that the responses were accepted by the Tribunal and satisfied any concerns he might have had. Accordingly, the Tribunal suspended the appellant on an interim basis.  3) The Court concludes that the holding of critical incident review does not connote any wrongful act or omission on the part of any member of the patient care team. Rather, it is part of the process by which health authorities evaluate their delivery of care to determine if adequate standards are being met, or how things could be improved. The hearing should proceed in the same fashion as it proceeded before the Tribunal."
2_2007skqb378.txt,"The outstanding issue is child support, past and future. The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past. Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent is a farmer. His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made. The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment. However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose. It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income. In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support. The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%. An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added. The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528. As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe. This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused. The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally. It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now. 3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support. The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable. 3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access. She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.  4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200.","The parties have three children, three of which are now with the respondent. The parties resided with their respective parents on alternate weeks. In 2004, the petitioner moved with the three children to Alberta. In 2005, the children moved back to the respondent's residence. In 2006, the respondent paid $300 per month as child support but made no payment for the month of June. The petitioner now wants to be compensated for lost wages and the cost of fuel. HELD: 1) The capital cost allowance is an ordinary, and not extraordinary, expenses and would be encompassed in the basic child support. 2) The petitioner knew this and when she elected to pay the balance she did so unilaterally and on her own initiative. It would be inappropriate to now compel the respondent to contribute when he earlier expressed a contrary position. This is one further collateral matter. The respondent acknowledges that he has, from time to time, borrowed money from the bank accounts of the children. He was able to do this because he had signed authority. It may be that he had the consent of each child, but the fact remains that such conduct is wrong and should not be repeated. 3) The respondent was awarded one-half of the $4,237.16 payable for child support for 2005 and 2006. The other half should be paid by monthly payments of $350. 4) There were certain health costs and they were extraordinary and to be shared by the parties. 5) An appropriate retroactive variation of the order dated June 29, 2004 would be effected. The costs of chiropractic treatment, orthodontist fees and medical fees were all accounted for.  6) An independent division of family property owned by the respondent was to be paid in the amount of $143.5 million. RRSPs were to be deducted from the $285.00 payable for the two children. 7) Costs of child support payable in the years 2004 and 2005 to be calculated using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke (CanLII), [2001] SKQB 528. The calculations are as follows: $26,350; $270.00 for two months payable by each party; $1,200 payable by the petitioner in the two years commencing September 1, 2005.  8) The costs were calculated in the range of $400 to $542.00 and the respondent contributed nothing toward that amount. It is fair if the contributions are equal, taking into account the incomes of the parties"
c_2014skqb144.txt,The Court dismissed the application. It found that the accused was not capable of representing himself but that the accused had not shown that he was indigent.,"The accused was charged with possession of a controlled substance contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He was committed to stand trial on the noted offence of trafficking. At the preliminary hearing, the accused failed to complete any of the steps outlined in his previous order and had not made any attempt to inquire into a loan or home equity line of credit. He applied to have court appointed counsel appointed to his behalf in the event the prosecution insisted on proceeding with a trial in breach of the accused's Charter right to a fair trial. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged of possession for the purpose of trafficking and he has failed to meet the second criterion of being indigent. He has made no effort to obtain financing or make arrangements to put in place financing arrangements with counsel. The Court found that the accused is unlikely to conduct his own defence in light of the personal issues he is facing and his methamphetamine addiction. He comes before this court in the same position as he was on the earlier occasion without having attempted in any way to utilize his personal resources to obtain counsel and, therefore, it is important to provide a reasonable window of time for the accused to start to make such arrangements."

At the end of the review they were to provide a written report to the hospital's Chief Executive Officer. The hospital staff participating in the investigation and review were advised that their information would be treated as part of a 'peer review' and therefore confidential. Upon receipt of the report the hospital, as a result, refused to disclose the report to the families. An application pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act was made by an M.L.A., who sought for the disclosure of the report and for a review of the hospital's decision to not release the report. The hospital decided to release the full report. The appellant employees appealed the decision of the hospital, claiming that they had been assured confidentiality. Allowing the appeal, that the disclosure of personal information consisting of personal recommendations or evaluations, character references, or personal evaluations by the appellants and other hospital staff are presumed under s. 20(3)(g) of the Act to be an unreasonable invasion of a third party's personal privacy. Under s. 20(1) the hospital is required to refuse to disclose this information. It necessarily follows that recommendations in the report founded upon such information is also presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of privacy and is likewise not to be disclosed. The remainder of the report is disclose able.","The appellants sought a judgment in respect to a peer review of three individuals who had committed suicide at the hands of their own hand. The decision was made against the recommendations of senior management at the hospital and contrary to assurances given to the families that they would be receiving an external review. The authors, being physicians with privileges at the Regional Hospital, were approached by the appellants to participate in the peer review. They were assured confidentiality would be honoured. They proceeded to publish the report, which was not to be released to the public. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that peer review is an educational tool and confidentiality should not be grounds for suspicion by family members or members of the general public. As the appellant family alleged that they had been betrayed by the hospital, a review of the circumstances of the three individuals would be undertaken by the appellant physicians, all of whom were to be the authors of the report. The appellant's physician was referred to the summary of the review team report which was to be used as an internal document only, thus ensuring the confidentiality of the participating physicians."
4_2003skqb490.txt,"The applicants brought a motion seeking proof of the Will in solemn form, questioning the testamentary capacity, due execution of the will and raising the issue of undue influence and coercion. HELD: The motion was dismissed with costs. The role of the Court is that of a gatekeeper. The Court will not send an issue to trial unless evidence is brought forth which, if accepted, would tend to negative knowledge and approval of testamentary capacity. No issue of credibility arose.","FIAT. In January 2003, one of 29 nieces and nephews of the deceased sought proof of the will of the late, great-grandfather, who was 88 at the time of his death. He had a small stroke which affected his speech temporarily few days before the will was signed. The doctor testified that in his opinion the doctor could instruct and complete last will and testament at that time. Evidence now before the Court by one of the witnesses to the will is that two and one-half years before he signed the will, he instructed a lawyer to draw a different will, which was never signed because of family pressure. The evidence is that he had instructed the lawyer in 1998 and then changed his mind, which is nothing out of the ordinary about the will. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)There is a presumption of testamentary capacity and in the face of challenge the executors have provided uncontradicted evidence which affirms positively the testimony capacity of the father. 2)There was nothing out-of-the ordinary about this will. While some may have given instructions for 1998 to change his mind and then obtained the notes of a lawyer who had received instructions for never-completed will in 1998, its admissibility and relevance are far from clear. Two and a half years prior to the signing of the last will, the father had written a very different will which he had been trying to execute for some months. Those attacking the will have not come forth with evidence which, if accepted at trial, would tend to negate testamentarian capacity."

HELD: In reviewing the registrar's judgment, it is clear that he succinctly and accurately set forth the facts of the matter and that to that end there has been no complaint regarding the judgment. The court considered the registrar's analysis in this matter and can find no fault with his reasoning. The registrar's interpretation is supported by the legislation and, based upon the undisputed facts which he found, the interpretation is reasonable. The application is dismissed.","FIAT: The applicant, a bankrupt, seeks from the Court an order pursuant to Rule 30(1) of the general rules under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act under s. 187(11) of TheBankruptcy & Insolventcy Act extending the time for the bringing of this appeal. The issue relates to whether the applicant has demonstrated a basis for the order sought pursuant to rule 30(2) under the BANKRUPTCY Act. HELD: The application is dismissed. The respondent issued a formal judgment in July 2006 and the eight page judgment sets forth in detail the background to the disputed issue, canvasses the submissions of the applicant and the Trustee, and then provides an analysis leading to the registrar's conclusion. The registrar defines the issue in the following terms: 'Should the applicant be permitted to make a claim as secured creditor under the debtor's proposal?' Under the background assessment, the trustee's analysis that permits court to get to the PPSA is correct but the submission that section 20(2)(a) is applicable is not supported by the legislation. This can only be accomplished by an amendment to that section. The applicant's appeal of the disallowance of its claim in secured is dismissed; the trustee did not request costs and none will be awarded."
8_2017skqb53.txt,"The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography. The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant. She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence. The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO). The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility. The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography. The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”. The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment. The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower. The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos. The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs. The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused. The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant. The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone. The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2). The application proceeded by voir dire. The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire. The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. | HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained. Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search. The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established. Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant. The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record;  2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means. This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search. It was not admitted; 3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context. There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant; 4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety. However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 5) The ITO provided sufficient description. It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO. Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and  6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence. The ITO sought only the search history.","The accused applied for relief pursuant to s.24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence seized through the execution of a search warrant. The application proceeded by way of voir dire. The Crown called evidence to amplify the statements set forth in the Information to Obtain a Warrant to Search [ITO]. The accused disputed the facial validity of the search warrant, the validity of it, and the suggested criminal offence of possession of child pornography. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The scope of evidence at an amplification hearing is limited to correcting minor or technical errors made by the investigators, or to include erroneous information in the ITO. This additional evidence corrects good faith errors of the police in preparing the ITOS, rather than deliberate attempts to mislead the authorizing justice. 2)There was no evidence before the court as to the accused's prior authorization and probable grounds. The ITO was not a separate proceeding from the trial proper and the evidence taken on voir net forms no part of the evidence at trial unless the parties expressly agree to its incorporation. To allow the Crown to supplement the record with Sgt. Parisien's testimony would be to countenance subsequent validation.  3)The Court reviewed the cases that dealt with the use of amplification evidence and found that it was not necessary to separate the evidence from the evidence in order to justify or authorize the seizure of additional items. 4)The accused's s.8 Charter rights were violated as a result of the warrantless search.  5)Although the accused called no evidence at the amplification hearing, it was apparent that he was using a different software to get everything on the computer and then it was up to the forensic examiner to delve into the computer in accordance with his instructions. It was unclear whether any actual messages between the complainant and the accused were obtained."
e_1999skqb150.txt,"FIAT. It was held in an earlier fiat in June that the addition of the two proposed plaintiffs asserted new causes of action and amendments to the statement of claim could only be considered pursuant to an application under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act. The defendant resisted the joinder of the new plaintiffs and amendments on the basis of undue delay and actual prejudice. The statement of claim alleged nuisance, and in the alternative, negligence against the City with respect to the design, construction and maintenance of the sewer system causing his basement to flood. The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time. Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied. The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes. HELD: The amendments were allowed. 1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The facts were uncertain. It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced. If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period. 2)Inexcusable delay was not established. 3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice. If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction. No evidence had been lost. The basement was available for inspection. It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants. 4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments. The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice. It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff. It appeared that the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendment was not apparent at the time the original claim was issued and arose out of the same occurrence. 4)Costs in the cause.","FIAT. The proposed plaintiffs applied to set aside proposed amendments to the original statement of claim and the joinder of parties to that claim. In the end, the Court held the amendments did not require leave to amend and found that the infant could be joined as a plaintiff on the basis she was an infant against whom the limitation period for the Urban Municipality Act had intervened. The amendments could only be considered pursuant to an application under s. 44(11) of The Queen's Bench Act as amended. HELD: The application was allowed. The defendant resisted the joinders of the original plaintiffs and the amendments to statement of claims on the grounds of undue delay on the part of the proposed plaintiffs and actual prejudice to the defendant. The Court ordered the amendments be allowed. 1)The limitation period in s. 314(1) applies from the time when the damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The fact that the plaintiff was not appears to have arisen from inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice made at the time. Her joinder as a party in this situation is contemplated by the Rules (Rule 38(1)) and normally would not be contested. 2)The applicant was not included as a joint owner of the property when the original action was commenced. She was not a party to the action when the damage was caused. 3)The amended claim was brought within the one-year limitation period set out in the Act. The court ordered the defendants to pay costs to the plaintiff and to join the parties on the amended claim.  4)The plaintiff's claim that it has suffered actual prejudice was not accepted.  5)The Court was of the view that the trial judge in this case was constrained by only one rule: he must exercise that unfettered discretion judicially."

The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother with access on the same terms as contained in the interim order. Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children. Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job. It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support. 2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence. She suffered an economic disadvantage from the marriage and its breakdown. 3)The car owned by the petitioner when she married was exempt property. The motorcycle was disregarded as there had not been a significant increase in value. The list prepared by the respondent was used to divide household goods, tools and equipment. 4)The respondent was to assume one-half of the bank loan and it was agreed that the pension funds should be shared equally. 5)It would be unfair and inequitable to the custodial parent to order an equal division of the matrimonial property. The petitioner was granted possession of the matrimonial home until the younger child's 18th birthday or until she vacated the property. 6)The respondent cannot avoid his responsibility of providing an adequate level of support by turning his back on well-paid employment. Spousal and child support were deducted from his share of the matrimonial home. The petitioner was given leave to return to Court after February 28, 1999 for reconsideration of child support.","The petitioner sought a divorce, custody of the children, spousal and child support and an unequal division of matrimonial property. The respondent had taken leave of absence from his employment to work in the construction industry and had difficulty maintaining a home. When he returned, the petitioner applied for an order listing the home for sale and for a pre-trial conference which was to proceed in January 1996. HELD: 1)The petitioner was given leave to return to the Court so that child support may again be considered. 2)The parties had traditional marriage. The petitioner was the breadwinner, the father's income was reduced from $4,000 to $1,000 per month and the respondent's pension funds were to be shared equally. 3)There were no extraordinary circumstances in the meaning of s.22(1)(a) which would make an equal division of the home unfair or inequitable to the petitioner.  4)The respondent was ordered to pay $2,600 in monthly spousals, $400 to be paid prior to the trial and $500 in arrears per month. 5)The court was not convinced these were the actions of a father intent upon doing what was best for his children. The single unusual circumstance in this case was the extent of the petitioner's assets, considering she was only 24 years old when she married Calvin."
e_2016skpc106.txt,"HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached. Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home. The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house. The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights. The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children. The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights. The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The complainant was a child protection worker employed by the Ministry of Social Services. She enlisted the assistance of Moose Jaw Police to enter the accused's apartment to investigate whether the children were in need of protection and if necessary to apprehend the children. The accused kicked the complainant and hit her. The defence argued that the accused was not in hot pursuit of an individual and that apprehension was justified on that date merely by reason of him having contact with the complainant. HELD: The child protection worker did not have any lawful authority to enter Ms. Bigsky's apartment. She was not exercising criminal law power and her entrance to that suite will be contrary to her section rights, unless that entrance and search is determined to be lawful under some other legal authority. The most fundamental question here is whether the police officer had the legal authority (under s. 16 of The Child and Family Services Act) to enter her apartment and to arrest the accused. The fact that a worker had directed the accused not to have any contact with her does not alter that situation. The evidence before the court was that the mother had communicated to the accused that she was concerned that he was involved in an assault and that she should allow them in because she believed he was in the suite and that he wasn't trying to apprehend her children. When the accused testified that he had not seen the accused at all that day and had not pursued the child to the residence, the fact that the worker had informed the accused she had to open the door and allow her in and that they would force their way in did not alter the situation. On March 23, 2015, the accused entered the complainant's apartment suite and she was with the mother and the children when she arrested the child. She advised the mother that the father was at the apartment and she advised her that she could not enter the suite without her consent because there was no warrant to enter. The mother advised the officer that she would close the door if the child was not with her and that if she did so, she would force her way in. The argument between the two women was heated and the mother kicked the accused and punched her in the face. She suffered no injuries. The court concluded that the officer had no lawful authority and he was not attempting to act under the criminal code. It was not established that the consent of the children or that he communicated to her that he could enter her suite and to allow her to enter without their consent or knowledge of the"
e_2009nssm47.txt,"The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property. The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend. As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help). While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed. Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements). While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial.","The plaintiff claimed that the defendant had cut down some trees on his property, by mistake. The defendant, who had worked in forestry all of his life, offered to help the plaintiff remove the trees. The plaintiff was initially reluctant to accept the defendant's offer of assistance, but eventually convinced himself that it was the best way to do so. He cut the trees himself, at a cost of $5,000 to the plaintiff. The court found that the plaintiff was not only liable for the actions of the defendant, but also for the damage caused by the tree cutting. The claim against the defendant was dismissed. There was no evidence of blameworthiness on the part of the plaintiff, who could not have foreseen the defendant would do what he did and should not incur any legal responsibility."
e_2002skpc80.txt,"The accused was charged with owning a dog that without provocation attacked a person contrary to the Urban Municipality Act s.135.3(3). There were four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001. At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on any of the four occasions. The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced. HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions. The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post. There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled. The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty. 2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3). It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands. The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed. logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog. One would not expect dog to be attached to logging chain if there were no concerns.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 135.3(3) of the Urban Municipalities Act. The evidence indicated that the accused's dog escaped through a garbage can enclosure in front of his house, and then ran through the backyard of his neighbour. The accused argued that he had not taken reasonable steps to prevent the offence from occurring. HELD: The accused was fined $200. On the definition of attack, the court found that the dog was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed, that it ran from its yard and attacked the lady attending a garage sale, and that, inexplicably, the dog got off its leash. The court imposed the appropriate fine. 1)The accused did not take reasonable steps. On all of the evidence, he failed to show that after a dog attacks, it responds to its owner's commands. 2)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which backed up the Crown's evidence. The dog was in close proximity and was snarling and barking, but in that case she was inside of her residence. 3)There was clear evidence that on three separate occasions the dog had run through the neighbor's house and then out the back gate, which would indicate that there weren't reasonable steps taken to prevent a small person, a small child, or the dog from getting free itself. Somehow, this happened despite the fact that the owner had already removed the leash. 4)The dog's actions might have justified requiring a hearing under the other section of The Urban Munipalities Act, which provides for determination as to whether a dog is dangerous or not. The appropriate fine in the circumstances is $200 and that's the fine that I impose."

As per the order, she personally served the appellant's mother and notified the appellant of the hearing date by text message. He didn't appear and default judgement was granted against the appellant in the amount of $11,031.35. The appellant appealed, arguing the adjudicator failed to follow the natural requirements of justice. He denied being in contact with his mother. He admitted receiving the text message(s) but said he didn't believe the respondent, but didn't make any further inquiries. New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal. Appeal dismissed. The right to be heard is a fundamental right, and an appeal of a default judgment must be subject to the highest scrutiny. Here the respondent's claim was valid. The adjudicator had the jurisdiction/authority to make an order for substituted service and the respondent followed it. At the very least, the appellant was notified of the hearing dates by text message(s). While he may not have believed the messages, he should have taken some steps to confirm with the court if there was indeed a hearing set. He failed to prove he had a reasonable excuse for defaulting, chose to ignore the notice, and was mistaken only as to what would be the outcome if he failed to appear.","The respondent appeals a decision of the Adjudicator of the Small Claims Court in the amount of $11,031.35. The respondent appeals that decision by Notice of Appeal (form 9) filed with the court on the same date and within the 30 day appeal period. The singular ground of appeal cited in the appellant's Notice is a failure to follow the requirements of natural justice. The appellant mistakenly showed up for the hearing on the wrong date, which was one day after the actual hearing. While waiting around for half an hour, he checked the doors of the Court House several times, then assumed that Court was cancelled because of bad weather. On that hearing date, the adjudicator issued an order for Substituted Service by serving a copy of the claim on the respondent's mother and by texting to the defendant the new hearing date. This decision was appealed. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with costs of $139.35 to the respondent. 1)It is a breach of nature justice not to have a service of documents as provided in the Act and Regulations. 2)It does not automatically follow that just because they were not present that their appeal will be allowed. The Court has sympathy for the appellant and for the reason he did not attend the hearing. This is a case which must be reheard to give all parties an opportunity to present evidence and be heard by an adjudicator. Natural justice demands that he be heard. Here, the appellant was not mistaken about the date of the hearing, he was mistaken as to what would be the outcome of his absence and he chose to ignore it and make no further inquiries. This does not constitute a reasonable excuse as found in Kemp, supra nor one that the Court had sympathy for in Forsyth, supra."

The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.","The accused was charged with four counts of sexual assault, including touching a person under the age of 14 years with a part of his body contrary to s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and two counts of touching directly or with an object contrary to the same s. 151 of the Code. The accused and his family lived in the same neighbourhood as the complainant, which is not far from the school. The Crown argued that the accused's evidence was not credible since the complainant did not immediately scream out when she was touched, or report any of the incidents to other persons shortly thereafter, she kept going back to visit her father, who lived with the accused, even after these incidents had occurred, and repeatedly put herself at risk by allowing herself to be alone with him. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. 1) The accused had a common-law relationship with the complainant. He had two children, one of whom was between 10 and 11 years old. The other child was between 12 and 15 years old at the time of the alleged offences. 2) He lived in a house full of people all the time. There was some confusion between the evidence of the witnesses about where each household might have lived and when. The doctrine of reasonable doubt applies to the issue of credibility. In R. v. Ewanchuk (1999) 1 SCC, [1999] 1 C.G. was the only person who was privy to the details of each of the four counts. 3) The Crown did not offer any evidence as to the relationship between the witnesses. It was not established that the relationship was one of trust or mutual understanding. 4) There was no evidence the accused had any motive to lie or mislead the court.

The court would make no comment on the merits of the appellant's intended submissions to that court or in any event regarding the reference to access in the Private Guardianship Order or access provision within the meaning of s.78(6) of the Act. Finally, the parties were not precluded from raising the issue before the Court of Appeal if it was necessary."

The caveat purported to be based upon a right to receive royalties from all gas, carbon and oil produced from the land. The applicant denied having ever received the notice to lapse. The applicant sought: 1) retroactive reinstatement of the caveat by order of the Court; and 2) an inquiry by the Court as to whether or not the caveat was removed improperly. The respondent companies that acquired an interest in the subject land subsequent to the caveat being removed opposed the application based, among other things, on the principle of indefeasibility of title, as did the Registrar of Land Titles. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1) Even if the caveat was removed improperly, the Court ought not to retroactively reinstate it, because to do so would defeat the fundamental principle of indefeasibility of title that has been continued in The Land Titles Act, 2000; and 2) it would not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief. The process, if the applicants chose to pursue it, would be an action under Part XII of the Act.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that even if the caveat was wrongfully removed by the Registrar of Land Titles, it would not be appropriate to retroactively reinstate the caveat. The companies that acquired an interest in the South West Quarter of Section Twenty-seven (27), in Township Two (2), in Range Four (4), in the Province of Saskatchewan, in the Dominion of Canada, were entitled to costs of defending the application. The respondents were awarded costs of the action."
d_2005skqb454.txt,"The plaintiff sues the defendants for $50,000 plus interest. The claim is based on the allegation that the plaintiff loaned the defendant Kelly $69,000. The plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan. However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made. In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly. The only discussion she seems to have had was with her husband after which she wrote a cheque to the defendant.","The plaintiff sought damages in the amount of $50,000 plus interest in accordance with the provisions of The Pre-judgment Interest Act. The claim was based on the allegation by the plaintiff that she loaned some $69,000 to the defendant, who she then husband Ken, into the auto brokering business known as Auto Brokers 1999 (E M). The claim went on to say that the defendants agreed to repay the loan in $1,500 per month, that some payments were made, but in the end, an amount of approximately $61,000 was still outstanding. The defendant denied the loan was a loan and asserted that the plaintiff had not made a loan to either of them. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1)The evidence of the cross-examination of the husband and the plaintiff on the basis that she did not testify on the evidence was not supported by the evidence. There was no written contract or other written evidence of any agreement between the plaintiff, the defendant Kelly Eiswerth and/or the numbered company defendant evidencing the nature of the transaction. 2)There was no evidence that any of the payments made by E & M to the plaintiff were made monthly or on a monthly basis. The husband's testimony was not stated on the witness' affidavit as to whether the plaintiff advanced the money or if she made a monthly decision to pay it as a loan. On the basis of her testimony that the defendant did not have a written agreement with respect to the amount advanced, it was not proven that she advanced the decision on her own or that she had a discussion with her husband about it. 3)The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loans to either the defendant or the plaintiff was the affidavit filed by the husband. No other evidence was found as to how much was outstanding. 4)Issue No.5 was moot. The plaintiff had made a reasonable and prudent decision to make this loan. She did not authorize or authorize it. The evidence on the 'transition' was that there were subsequent transactions made by and at least one transaction where the plaintiff issued a further cheque of an amount in excess of $9,000."

The USA brought a motion to set a date for the extradition hearing. The respondent brought a motion requesting further disclosure and alleged that the USA had not disclosed all of the evidence in its custody or control. HELD: The application for disclosure was dismissed. A date for the extradition hearing was set.,"The accused, a Jamaican national living in Canada, applied for a stay of proceedings pending extradition on the grounds of contempt of court for failing to provide proper disclosure and for the Attorney General to discharge under s. 29(1) of the Extradition Act. HELD: The motion on behalf of the accused was granted and the hearing was to proceed on January 6, 2004.  1)The accused was entitled to disclosure of all the evidence in his custody or control except only the diplomatic note from USA to Canada which initiated the process. There had been no investigation in Canada of the alleged offence. The Attorney General has only that information which the USA authorities have seen fit to provide to him. 2)The application was dismissed.  3)The issues with disclosure were as follows: 1)It is alleged that the attorney general has not disclosed all of the evidence. Counsel for the accused however has undertaken that everything within the control of the AG has been turned over to the solicitor for the purposes of the extradition hearing. The AG's role is narrow one, confined to what is specified in the enabling statute. It is not the business of an extradition judge to assume responsibility for reviewing the actions of foreign officials in preparing the evidence for an extradition hearing; nor is it expedient at this stage. 4)The respondent argued that the application before Krueger J. in the Daul case was a violation of natural justice and no consideration was given to parallel common law rights advanced by the AG in Germany v. Schreiber. 5)It follows that the motion on Griffiths's behalf is without merit and it is accordingly dismissed."
c_2001skqb39.txt,"The defendants brought an application to compel responses to a large number of questions objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officer for SPMC, and sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The objections were categorized as the questions sought to elicit the plaintiff's manner of investigation or expert opinions; it should have been asked of another witness better suited to answer or third parties as the questions relate to issues between the defendant and the third parties; it was irrelevant or improper. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs were not required to answer questions which would require them to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2)The plaintiffs should answer what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire. 3)The affidavit answered whether Miner was a participant in the investigation notwithstanding the defendants are not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses at the discovery stage. 4)Any meeting between the plaintiff's investigators and the fire marshal clearly related to its investigation and is privileged. The defendants could obtain the information directly from the fire marshal. 5)The question of whether there was any liaison between the city fire investigator and SIAST was improper as it relates to the manner of investigation. Questions can be asked of the city. 6)Details of the plaintiff's investigation, including an engineer's report, was protected by litigation privilege. 7)The question regarding what observations were made of the damage was too vague. The plaintiff's claim was in excess of $7 million. A proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions and answers given or not given (Hill v. Arcola School Division). The defendants are not entitled to expert opinion. 8)Whether SPMC's insurer's investigation team participated related to manner of investigation and was therefore privileged. 9)The defendant will be able to examine the city in the third party claim with respect to documents from the fire department. 10)All discussions at mediation proceedings are strictly confidential. The name of the plaintiff's expert, who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation, is privileged. 11)The facts and observations upon which expert opinions are based must be disclosed including any photographs.  12)Whether any pattern on the wood would indicate contact by propane flame required expert opinion. 13)Questions concerning what material first ignited could only be answered by having experts reconstruct what in their opinion occurred at the time the fire started. 14)If the plaintiffs do not have a position (on whether there was a fire stop in the 1967 construction of the tower), there is no rule the court is aware of requiring them to adopt a position. They can be required to give an undertaking to provide a position if they adopt one at a later date. Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it. There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question. The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement. 19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.  20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them. 21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed. It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer. The same question can be put if the first did not answer it. The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each. The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings. Having all three present during each examination would have saved time and unnecessary legal fees. 22)The exhibit was not before the court to determine how complicated the question was. Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings. As a general rule examinations for discovery should be completed before the party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings. It would lead to endless delay if the examining party were allowed to simply adjourn and demand the undertakings be complied with. There were no exceptional circumstances.  24)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The defendants applied to compel responses to a large number of questions that were objected to at examinations for discovery of proper officers on behalf of Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (SPMC). They sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The plaintiffs had issued a statement of claim for damages in excess of $7,000,000 that alleged the application of a 'Torch on' air vapour barrier to the northeast corner of the Tower. The defendants had filed statement of defence in October 1998 and have subsequently brought third party proceedings against the City of Saskatoon, Fire Chief William Hewitt, and numerous architects and engineers. In this case, the plaintiffs sought to know whether a Mr. Miner was a participant in the investigation of the loss following the fire. HELD: 1)The question asked was too vague to answer. In an application of this nature a proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions asked and answers given or not given. That would include any photographs taken by the plaintiffs and upon which the plaintiffs' expert may have relied. 2)The respondents were not required to answer the questions asked. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to know what observations were made of the damage post fire, the damage to the roof and its occupants, the attic that would connect the point of breakout to the point where Hagblom were operating or were working. It would be another matter if the information was held by third parties under the control of the plaintiffs. If the party being examined has no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it. 4)The plaintiffs were not entitled to the names of the expert witnesses who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation. The plaintiff was only entitled to ask the question of the appellant's former employee if he had any opinion as to whether the appellant had received the information necessary to develop a position on the facts in issue. In any event the defendants would have the opportunity to examine the City in the third party claim. 5)The first issue was whether any of the documents referred to in the plaintiff's statement as to documents and statements which deal with facts relevant to the issues were privileged. The second issue was if the plaintiffs had any information that could be used to assist the defendant in its investigation. If so, they would be required to provide the plaintiffs with that information. 6)The issue of litigation privilege was not raised in the notice of motion.

c_2012skqb426.txt,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code. The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed. The accused is 52 years old and in poor health. He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders. The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence. Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed? HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","The offender pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law partner contrary to s.268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown has applied under Part XXIV of the Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. The offender is 52 years old and with a significant criminal record. The Court has jurisdiction to entertain the dangerous offender application because it is both the court which entered the conviction against the offender and is a superior court of criminal jurisdiction. HELD: 1)The offender is a high risk to re-offend violently and this risk will be mitigated only if he conscientiously applies himself to learning alternative ways of venting his frustration and anger.  2)There is no doubt that the offender fits the criteria set forth in the relevant Criminal Code provisions in force at the time. The only real issue is whether there is a reasonable possibility that he can eventually be controlled in the community so as to justify the imposition of a long term offender designation rather than a more serious dangerous offender designation.  3)There are two additional events that are germane to the consideration of his criminal history. On January 1, 1995, the offender was charged with common assault against his wife, which was resolved by having him enter into a recognizance wherein he was required to report to probation officer, have no contact with his wife and accept drug, alcohol and anger management programming. He had serious health problems and required surgery as a child to have a heart valve repaired. In 2008 he had a stroke and requires the use of a cane for stability and for walking lengthy distances. He appears to be in denial regarding his potential to abuse alcohol and does not appear to have seriously addressed the role alcohol plays in his life. His potential for violence in the future is high. If he refuses to do so, his risk for future violence will be high. 4)The Court had the benefit of two assessment reports, together with testimony from the authors of the reports. The first was a comprehensive 52-page report initiated following court order. The second was a 51-page summary of the findings of the Forensic Assessment Report (the 'Forensic Assessment Report'). It was prepared in the context of a similar set of circumstances involving the dumping of a corpse on the banks of the Fraser River in British Columbia. The two experts agreed that it was an absolute necessity that he seriously addresses his alcohol abuse problem and makes a commitment to sobriety for the remainder of his life (see R. v. Peters)."
b_2010skqb187.txt,"The plaintiff granted the defendant a mortgage over a parcel of land just outside the city limits. The defendant failed to make any payment. The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale. The defendant was a developer. He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act. The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price. HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply. The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA. There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision. The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. Normal bidding rules shall apply. The plaintiff was entitled to costs.",HELD: The application was dismissed and the usual bidding rules were applied. The applicant had failed to meet the requirements set out in the Farm Land Security Act (SFSA). The land had been purchased by a developer for development and its focus and direction had been the undertaking of a host of activities designed to develop the land into an industrial park. The Land was purchased by the developer for the purposes of farming with an emphasis on providing protection to farmers against loss of their farm land. The amendment to the SFSA provided that the purchaser must be a 'Mortgagor' on the mortgage to receive a significant cash payout. The redemption period was 90 days from the date of this decision. The plaintiff FMI shall have its costs taxed in the usual way.
2_2005skqb513.txt,"FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003. They are married and the family home is in Connecticut. The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan. The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.  1) The child was born in Canada. He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003. In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit. It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child. In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner. Reconciliation was attempted. The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned. The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada. For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence. At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles. The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy. Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut. The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home. 2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody. The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody. The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate. Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut. This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return.","FIAT: The parties are the parents of a child born April 10, 2003. They were married in Connecticut and the family home was in Laird, Saskatchewan. The respondent mother, an American citizen, continues to reside in Connecticut. The petitioner father brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: 1) The case law is at odds as to whether reference should be had to the domestic statute when addressing the issue of habitual residency under the Convention. In all cases to which the Court was drawn by counsel, the children have been ordered returned. 2) There is no question the petitioner did not consent to the respondent and Joshua's prolonged absence in the former jurisdiction. When they did not return, the consent was implicitly withdrawn and at that point for the purposes of the Convention, the Court determined that the child must have been habitually resident in the Contracting State immediately prior to being wrongfully removed or retained. The Court concluded that the relief under Article 12 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 is not in conflict with the case law developed under the convention. 3) The petitioner obtained an interim order in February 2004 which, inter alia, ordered the respondent to return Joshua to the United States and granted him sole custody. It is an open question whether the return should be conditional upon the respondent having varying the order he obtained in relation to the child's habitual residence. In any event, reconciliation was attempted and the child was returned to the petitioner."

The Court of Appeal had ordered the Crown to produce an itemized inventory of the information in its possession to enable the Queen's Bench to review the information the Crown should disclose to the defence. This fiat concerned several documents. The Crown had already disclosed the contents of each of these documents and the only matter remaining in issue was the name of the lawyer who released the information. This arose as a result of the action of a Regina lawyer who had improperly revealed information from two of his divorce clients with respect to the charges against LaPorte et al.

3_2001nssc117.txt,"The plaintiffs were Sergeants in the Town of Bedford Police Department. Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank. The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement. After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights. The intervenor union brought an application to strike the plaintiffs' proceeding on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Application granted; proceeding stayed pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable; if no application is made to lift the stay within two years, the action will stand dismissed. Where there is a threshold question of whether the dispute is arbitrable, that decision should initially be made, absent very limited exceptions, by an arbitrator and not by the court. It is irrelevant if the plaintiffs have now lost their rights to initiate the arbitration process.","The Halifax Regional Municipality Act, effective as of April 1, 1996, provided for the amalgamation of the municipal police forces into the HRM. The plaintiffs were part of a Bargaining Unit represented by the Municipal Association of Police Personnel (MAPP). The Board of Police Commissioners declined to consider the matter on the basis it had no jurisdiction to convene an investigation or inquiry since there was no evidence any demotion was the result of a disciplinary default. The Intervenor, on the other hand, submitted that the Commission had jurisdiction to investigate the matter. Dismissing the action, that the substance of the dispute was a dispute over the meaning of the Police Act and Regulations. The Act provided that individual contracts/rights (whether pre-existing or not) are fully replaced by the collective agreement and the Union's status as exclusive bargaining agent under the Trade Union Act. The collective agreement does, however, include a provision for non-police officers. HRM and MAPP had commenced collective agreement negotiations in 1996 and, prior to signing the agreement, they were not employees of the police force. In 1997, MAPP became part of the bargaining unit represented by MAPP. In 1998, the parties signed a collective agreement which incorporated the findings of the Interest Arbitration Award, including the classifications of Sergeant and Sergeant. In 1999, the plaintiff police officers were reduced in rank to the rank of Sergeant after negotiations for collective agreement commenced. In 2001, the police officer joined the MAPP bargaining unit as part of MAPP as a member of that bargaining unit. The plaintiff officers were not union members but were subject to the terms and condition of their employment contracts. They were reduced to serge after MAPP made a demand for their consent for any change to terms and conditions of employment. MAPP and the plaintiffs brought an action against MAPP for failure to represent. They argued that s. 41 and 42 of the TUA do not apply, because the cause of action pre-date the union agreement, and because the statutory freeze contained in the Act did not preclude the plaintiff pursuing any common law rights in the courts or that the exclusivity of bargaining agent provisions in the union were not applicable because the plaintiffs' rights as police officers are individual as opposed to collective rights, these are matters that involve the threshold question of whether the question is itself arbitrable.

The Court of Appeal adopted and held scrupulously to an exclusive jurisdiction model in respect to the interpretation and application of collective"

The Minister had refused on the grounds the union was neither certified nor a party to a voluntary agreement. Granting the application, that the Minister had misdirected himself on a point of law. Quite apart from certification and voluntary recognition, the union could attain bargaining rights pursuant to Part II of the Trade Union Act, which allowed an employer in the construction industry to assign bargaining and negotiating rights to an 'accredited employers' association' such as the Construction Management Labour Bureau Ltd. The Court ordered the Minister to exercise his discretion under s.107(4) of the Act according to law as set out in Part II of the Act and confirmed by the Appeal Division in Boyd &amp; Garland.","This was an appeal of a decision which overturned the respondent's claim that the applicant was not a party to a voluntary recognition agreement. Dismissing the appeal, that the Minister of Labour and Manpower had misinterpreted a point of law by stating that there were only two methods by which a union can obtain bargaining rights for the employees, i.e. certification and voluntary recognition. It was necessary for the Minister to exercise his discretion pursuant to s. 107(4) of the Trade Union Act as confirmed by the parties.

The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","The parties applied to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment, including his contribution to child care expenses and access provisions. The respondent claimed his income had been reduced and referred to his 1999 tax return indicating an income of $42,386.34. The petitioner argued that his mother no longer available to provide child care during his access weekends. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed in the amount of $1,000. 1)Once a material change has occurred in the circumstances of the children, pursuant to s. 14(a) of the Act, the issue of child support ought to be revisited. The evidence suggested that there had been some change in the respondent's circumstances. It did not satisfy the Court that there has been any material change in his circumstances. 2)The respondent provided no evidence as to the amount, the method or when his mother provided him with 'gifts' as he describes them. His father passed away prior to the pre-trial conference. The allegation is that he has received no gifts since then and his mother is not able to afford to help him. Without evidence of the earlier gifts, there was no means of comparing the present circumstance to the past."

HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst in the basement of her home. She alleged that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The defendant contested such instructions and, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not as result of the water not being turned off, but because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed. 1)The court could not find on the evidence that clear instructions were given to the town to disconnect the water service. The form executed by the plaintiff clearly indicated request for final billing. This cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes, elevate the likelihood of the plaintiff suffering damage to her property.  2)There was a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. The evidence demonstrated that the plaintiff's claim could not have been made by her daughter as she had no further standing and had legally divested title and not received any less value on the sale of the property in the process."

HELD: A fine plus a probation order with strict condition can accomplish the principles of sentencing. Each accused is fined $1,500 with a probation order for two years. Corrigendum received dated March 19, 2010 and added to fulltext.","The accused entered a guilty plea to committing an assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. After the plea was entered, a pre-sentence report was prepared on behalf of the accused and a copy of the victim impact statement was filed by the Crown. The victim also provided a personal letter of reference to the accused, which the accused did not provide to the court. The accused minimized his responsibility for the assault and took responsibility in court. HELD: The accused was sentenced to a fine of $1,500 plus a probation order for two years. The court found that a fine plus a court order with strict conditions could accomplish the objectives of sentencing. The principles of sentencing were summarized in R. v. Gardiner (1982), 68 C.C. (2d) 477, being Schedule to the Canada Act 1982. Taking into consideration both the aggravating and the mitigating factors, the court found a sentence of 18 months to 2 years less one day than the one imposed on the other accused, and that a suspended sentence with conditions was appropriate."

2008skqb146.txt,"FIAT: The parties have three children, Jill born December 1981, Luke born May 1986 and Keegan born November 1989. The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own. The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university. The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008. The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","FIAT: On September 19, 2007, the respondent filed an application for an order varying child support. The parties agree that given the age of the children, and their change in the amount of support payable by the respondent, that there has been a change in circumstances sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The children remain children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act.  2) The respondent's application for variation requested that he be allowed to pay any maintenance payable for the two children directly to the respondent so that the children no longer qualify as a child of that marriage within that meaning. 3) In the case of Bowman v. Bowman, 2005 SKQB, the Manitoba Court of Appeal suggested a three-step process in dealing with support orders for children who have reached the Age of majority. It can now be stated that the following three steps need to be addressed: firstly towards the ongoing child support for the children; secondly towards the arrears; and finally towards the balance of the payments necessary to meet the parties' obligations to pay the child support payable in the event that the parties cannot meet the required level of support by the time the children are registered with the province; secondly, to enable the respondent to pay support in an appropriate fashion. In this case the respondent is to pay $380 per month plus 33% of all s. expenses for support of Keegan. Based upon the respondent's 2007 income of $44,781 and the income of his wife, $90,628, the amount payable by him to be paid towards Keegan is $10,587. The Court of Justice agreed with the parties that this amount should be increased to $20,000. The real issue between the parties appears to be in respect to the factors to be considered when the children were attending university and how this would affect the Guideline amounts payable. It is well-settled that full time attendance in a post-secondary education program may result in a child over a age of majority qualifying as a 'child' within this meaning. As success has been divided, there will be no order as to costs."
9_2006skca114.txt,"This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent had pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code, and was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. The Crown appealed the sentence, which was set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision and 1 year community supervision. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit, failing to take into account the seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the respondent, the criminal history and other circumstances of the offender, and his need for psychological and substance abuse counseling and further education. 2) The respondent was already served the 90 day closed custody portion of the sentence originally imposed. That sentence was to be set aside. In addition to the time already served, the respondent is to serve 12 months in closed custody to be followed by a period of community supervision of six months and a year probation.

The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation. The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence. The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers. The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims.

The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. HELD: Leave was granted. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances. He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation 16 times. He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had not attended treatment.","The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed on the respondent after a sentencing circle.

The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: The sentencing circle was inappropriate in these circumstances given the level of violence, the respondent's high risk to reoffend, his consistent ignoring of or refusing to follow court orders and the fact a penitentiary term was called for. The appeal was allowed and a sentence of four years imprisonment from this date on each count to be serve concurrently was imposed.

He was sentenced to a fine of $1,500, placed on probation for 18 months and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of the dental work in the amount of $3,263.30. 2) The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and significant pain for a number of months after the assault. Extensive dental treatment was required and will be required at some point in the future. The plaintiff has minimal scarring. He is awarded general damages of $12,500. 3) The pleadings and the affidavit evidence do not support a substantial award for aggravated damages. However, the photographs graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered. Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers. These circumstances justify an award of aggravated damages in the sum of $2,000. 4) The plaintiff was awarded special damages in the amount of $1,911.70.","The plaintiff was standing with other patrons near the entrance to a pub when he was punched in the face and knocked unconscious by the defendant.

HELD: The plaintiff was awarded general damages in the amount of $12,500.00, plus costs and pre-judgment interest.  Adding in aggravated damages, a fair award for general damages of $2,000.00. In assessing general damages, the Court of Appeal referred to Rieger v. Burgess (1988), 66 Sask. R. 1, another case in which a trial judge reassessed the amount awarded by jury for non-pecuniary loss. The Court reviewed Queen's Bench Rule 153 (which requires a party to plead specifically any matter, fact or point of law which, if not specifically pleaded, might take the other party by surprise) and found that a fair value for general damage was $16,411.70."
6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The issue of whether the defendant's jurisdiction to deal with holiday pay was severed from the jury and left in reserve until the Court of Appeal renders its decision. HELD: 1)The plaintiff's hours of work were very flexible in the winter. Even if the plaintiff was entitled to holiday pay in lieu of time off, the plaintiff should be considered to have waived this entitlement by his conduct over the years. The defendant asserted that the plaintiff never claimed his right to holidays or holiday pay for 10 years and that the defendant relied on the plaintiff's conduct in this regard. 2)There were several preliminary issues which must be dealt with. The first issue was whether the plaintiff could rely on the presumption arising out of a requirement in the Labour Standards Act (the 'LSA') to establish he is entitled to holidays. The second issue was if the court finds his contract was not all-inclusive or that it did not exceed the minimum standards set out in the LSA. If the plaintiff is awarded his holiday pay, he should only be entitled to recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act, which only allows recovery of money under a contract up to 6 years after the cause of action arises. 3)In the alternative, the defendant claims that the doctrine of estoppel or waiver should apply to prevent the plaintiff from claiming his entitlement to holiday compensation in the event the court determines this Court had jurisdiction to determine the issue of holiday pay. As such, it would be contrary to public policy for this Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff’s actions by calculating his holiday compensation on the basis of his wage, salary, benefits and holidays. 4)In this case the plaintiff clearly indicated that the $250.00 portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. He also asserted that holiday pay should not be included as it was really part of his salary and only designated as an allowance to avoid taxation.  5)The onus and burden in wrongful dismissal case rests with the plaintiff. The onus is on the defendant to rebut the presumption, in accordance with some exception in the lSA. In this case, the court may rely on s.30(1) to establish his holidays are to be considered holidays. 6)The defendant's claim that if the Court finds"
b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","The accused applied for a declaration that s. 300 of the Criminal Code constitutes an unreasonable limitation of one or more of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 2, and s. 11(c) and (d) of the Charter. HELD: 1)The accused were found guilty of three counts of defamatory libel and one count of publishing without lawful justification or excuse that was likely to injure the reputation of a police officer by exposing him to hatred, contempt or ridicule or that was designed toinsult the police officer knowing that the matter published was false. 2)There was a rational connection between the objectives of protecting the privacy and reputations of persons in s.300 of the Code and the limitation on freedom of expression as guaranteed under s.2(b). The threshold test for the application of s. has been met.  3)S.300 is of sufficient importance to justify an infringement of s2(2). It is not arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations. 4)The impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern. There is proportionality to the legislation in that the measures must be fair and not arbitrary and carefully designed to achieve the objective and rationally connected to the objective. 5)Individuals are not faced with reverse onus if a matter published is of such trivial character as to be reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. 6)Saskatchewan did not have a high level of criminal activity and the proportionality test was met. The accused were accompanied by a number of other persons and the sign and the printing thereon were visible to persons passing by and to those looking out of windows."

The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","The respondent's IRB for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident was not less than the IRB calculated for the first 180 days as determined pursuant to s. 116 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The appellant argued that the Act is intended to correlate a non-earner's income replacement benefit against which s. 117(4) is designed to be measured is that of a 'weighted average' calculation. The parties brought the matter back for further determination because SGI was paying the respondent an amount less than that. HELD: 1) The respondent has correctly calculated its IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the respondent's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. Counsel for Montgrand also appealed SGI's calculation of interest on monies owed to Montgrand on the basis of pre-judgment interest. 2) The Court of Appeal referred the matter of determination of the calculation of the IRBs for both the first180 day period and the post 180 day period to the appellant. The issues on appeal are whether SGI correctly calculated Montgrand's income and whether Montgrand has the benefit provided by s. 121 of the Act. 3) The trial judge erred in holding that the income replacement fund (IRB) for the respondent as a whole is to be calculated in accordance with the standard approach used by SGI. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's (TSB) IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. 4) The hearing judge's interpretation conflicts with the provisions of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations, particularly s. 24(1) thereof."

The complainant described certain incidents that amounted to sexual assault when she was under the age of 16. The Respondent had previously been acquitted of charges based on the same allegations in criminal court. The Respondent has abused a child within the meaning of the Act. Although the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities, it is elevated with the seriousness of the allegations and their implications. However, it is considerably less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.","The Agency applied for a finding that the father had abused a child pursuant to s. 62(a) or (c) of the Children and Family Services Act. The mother of the child had stayed with the father when he was seventy-seven years old and had never been married or lived with a woman, just him and his dog. The daughter had sexual contact with him on occasion when she was eleven or twelve years old. These sexual encounters came to light when the daughter and her grandfather were watching a television program about sexual assault.

There was a long history of relatively short terms of employment and several moves to take employment. The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training. For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00 The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since. The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00. The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment. This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties. The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose. Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001.

The parties had never had any financial stability in part because they far too readily accessed credit based on future expectations of capacity that have never been realized and they would be wise to cease utilization of credit for short term relief. HELD: The court found that the respondent's income for the purposes of child support was fixed at $6,875 per month and he was to receive a bonus of $927. In addition to the monies paid for medical expenses, there were other outstanding debts which must be paid to the respondent in the event of a disruption in his income. It was an exceptional situation and the respondent must keep himself current with respect to child support. His use of credit card for access and other expenses is entirely his personal choice. It is very clear that these parties have never had an income stability sufficient to promote long term self sufficiency. Doing so in the long run imperils the ability to provide properly for the children."
5_1993canlii6695.txt,"The plaintiff applied under Queen's Bench Rule 231 to strike the statements of defence of a corporate and individual defendant for failure to attend scheduled examinations despite service of an appointment and payment of conduct money to their solicitor. The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences. Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution. Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer. This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants. The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors. HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply. He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates. Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks.","The plaintiff applied to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant on the ground that the designated officer of the corporation failed to appear at an examination for discovery on the same grounds. The corporate defendant solicitor had previously telephoned the plaintiff's solicitors to schedule examinations for discovery and to obtain statements as to documents. The plaintiff's solicitor had then withdrawn and the defendants became represented by their current solicitor. HELD: The applications were dismissed with costs to the plaintiff. 1)The corporate defendant was not entitled to any conduct money for the initial attendances at the examinations nor for any subsequent attendances required for the completion of the examinations. 2)The non-attendances did not constitute'refusing or neglecting to attend' within the meaning of Rule 231. It could not be utilized respecting the particular non- attendances to strike their statements of defence.  3)On the basis of the conduct exhibited throughout the whole of these proceedings, the defendants were guilty of contempt of court. The contempt proceedings were still before the court even though they were adjourned sine die. The defendants had abused the discretion of the court that was exercised in their favour to set aside judgments obtained against them and to permit them to file defences. 4)The defendants were awarded costs of the applications in any event of the cause."
1998canlii3382.txt,"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","The appellant was an employer and the respondent union. By successorship, they were parties to a collective agreement signed in 1994. The collective agreement establishes employee salaries for that period and is properly regulated through arbitration. The employer appealed the employer's application to strike the union's statement of claim on the ground that the claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The respondent appealed, seeking leave for this purpose. At issue was whether the letter of July 22, 1994 was an ancillary document and whether it forms part of the collective agreement. Appeal allowed; the Chambers judge dismissed the application; the appeal was directed to the arbitrator and directed that the action be stayed pending submission to arbitration as provided for by the in-laws. There were four considerations that supported the conclusion that, where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of the dispute, that issue should generally be determined initially at arbitration."
