1990canlii4096.txt,"This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","The respondent applied for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings in respect of charges prosecuted against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The applicant had been previously barred from entering the investment dealer's premises. The respondent had been advised that he would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction were not granted. The appeal Division found that the test in American Cyanamid does not apply to this case. The appellant's application for an order restraining the respondent from entering into further proceedings was dismissed. The decision of Nathanson, J. in Ripley v. Investment Dealer's Association of America was also dismissed. In this case, the appeal court found that it was against the public interest and the interest of other members of the Association to allow a person, who has been convicted of serious charges, to indefinitely postpone the imposition of a penalty. The court also refused to enjoin the disciplinary process. The applications for certari and mandiorari were dismissed."
1991canlii2535.txt,"This was an appeal from a conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, a push dagger, contrary to s.89(a) of the Criminal Code. For the appellant, that the trial judge failed to consider whether the knife fit the definition of a weapon under s.2 of the Criminal Code and, in addition, failed to satisfy himself that the accused intended to use the dagger to cause injury or death or for the purposes of threatening or intimidating. The matter was remitted for a new trial.","The appellant was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon, a push dagger, contrary to s.89(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge would have to be satisfied that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the push dagger was concealed, that it was weapon as defined in the Code, and that the appellant intended to use the push dag to cause injury or death to persons."
1991canlii2608.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision which overturned the respondent's convictions on charges of operating overweight vehicles contrary to s.172 of the Motor Vehicle Act. The Court had overturned the convictions on the ground that the reverse onus provision of s.172, respecting the accuracy of the scale, violated s. 11(d) of the Charter. Allowing the appeal and restoring the convictions, that the trial judge did not rely on the prima facie effect of the Crown's evidence, but rather had ample evidence concerning the accuracy of the scales upon which to rely.","The three respondents were convicted, after their trials, of operating overweight vehicles on the highway. The offence with which each was charged was a violation of the Motor Vehicle Act, then s. 172 of the R.S.N.S.' 1967, and now s. 192 of the Regulations made under the Motor Vehicles Act. The charges were set aside and the conviction of each respondent was restored. The respondents appealed. Dismissing the appeals, that on both of these principal issues the summary conviction appeal court judge erred in law. On the strength of the evidence, it has been shown beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was operating his vehicle well above the permitted weight and tolerances on the roadway."
1994canlii5206.txt,"The Plaintiff, aged 72 years, claimed ongoing damages resulting from a whiplash injury suffered in a motor vehicle accident 5 years earlier. She had been involved in previous accidents and also suffered from osteoporosis and hypertension. She displayed some symptoms of mental illness, including paranoid delusions. HELD: The Plaintiff's evidence as to her condition was not accepted. Based upon the opinion of her doctor, the court found partial disability of 3 months, and that her symptoms were fully resolved within 1 year. The court awarded general damages of $18,000.00.  The court refused to award damages for loss of housekeeping capacity, given the Plaintiff's disability prior to the accident.","The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident in the City of Regina. Liability was not in issue. The plaintiff was found to have a whiplash injury which had a period of about one year following the accident. She suffered from diabetes, osteoporosis and hypertension. Her physical therapist was not called to testify. HELD: The plaintiff's damages were set at $18,000. 1)The proper level at the time of the accident was $18k. 2)No weight was given to the expert who was familiar with her pre-accident state except for the fact that she had just broken both hips. 3)The plaintiff's expenses were allowed to be taxed. 4)The court found that the proper level was $20,000 and that the plaintiff was substantially disabled prior to the accident at that time. The proper level is $18000."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation was amalgamated with the defendant corporation and held itself out as an energy efficiency consultant. The defendant entered into a letter agreement whereby the defendant would pay the plaintiff a deposit and service fee of Eight Thousand Dollars ($8,000). The plaintiff paid the defendant what the terms deposit and what the defendant calls service fee in order to help pay the defendant's share of the energy savings enjoyed. The plaintiff brought a motion to set aside the default judgment on the basis of forum non conveniens. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The defendants application to set off the default was dismissed. The court found that the defendants had failed to establish any reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. In fact, the Court found that there was no reasonable excuse at all for the defendant to have waited until mid-February 1995 before applying to set it aside."
1996canlii7150.txt,"FIAT. The defendant had been held in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. The issue here was responsibility for the legal costs incurred by the plaintiff to compel production. Her solicitor/client bill exceeded $50,000 including very large disbursements as a trustee was appointed to preserve the property and the defendant solicitor's files were seized. An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention. Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.  1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared. Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties. 2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge. It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs. It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","FIAT. The defendant was in contempt of court orders requiring him to account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. A trustee was appointed, and the files of Bawolin were seized. Then an accountant prepared a forensic audit. HELD: 1)The Court ordered the defendant to pay the solicitor/client costs taxed. Even if Siemens was substantially unsuccessful at trial in her allegations of wrongdoing by Bawol, still he ought to pay these costs because he caused the expense of the pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. 2)This was the more appropriate route in the circumstances. When all the evidence was in, it may transpire that Siemens is in fact, indebted to Bawoline as he now says, at the time of the contempt. 3)The judge ordered the liability to be taxed."
1997canlii1932.txt,"The plaintiff's leg was impaled for 25 minutes on an iron fence which he had attempted to climb for. He was treated at the emergency department of the Victoria General Hospital for an hour. He did not inform the doctors as to the length of time he had been impaled. Upon his release he was advised to watch for any infection. He was not issued antibiotics. The wound quickly worsened, and the plaintiff was forced to undergo surgery and a skin graft to repair his leg. He sued the doctors who initially treated him for negligence. Dismissing the action, that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way. While the defendants underestimated the nature and extent of the injury, they provided a recognized method of treatment based upon the knowledge they had. The real fault lies with the plaintiff who failed to reveal fully what had happened to him.","The plaintiff alleged negligence by the two defendants medical doctors. He alleged that a puncture/tear wound received while climbing an iron fence was impaled on it. He claimed that he was impaling on the fence for half an hour. The triage clerk at the hospital said that the plaintiff had been impaled for a period of time and then fell off the fence. He was hospitalized for 22 days. He claims that antibiotics should have been prescribed, the plaintiff should have seen his family doctor, and the would should not have been closed. He also claims that there was no evidence of infection or of natural disaster. Dismissing the claim, that the defendants and their medical staff did not fall below the standard of care required in their treatment of the plaintiff. Further, the plaintiffs loss is not attributable to any of the acts of the defendants but rather is the direct result of the injury."
1999canlii1730.txt,"The offender was convicted of robbery. He and four other young men attacked and violently robbed a university student of jewellery and other valuables worth more than $7,000. Despite poor upbringing, abuse at the hands of his stepmother, and being moved from many foster homes, the offender had completed high school and one year of university. There was a favourable pre-sentence report suggesting good prospects for rehabilitation, and a joint sentence recommendation for two years' imprisonment followed by two years probation with strict terms, including 180 hours of community service. Accepting the joint sentence recommendation, that the offender is at a crossroads, and has the talent and motivation to become reintegrated into society as a productive member of the community, and who will benefit from a shorter term of imprisonment than is usual for this type of offence, combined with post incarceration supervision.","The accused was convicted of robbery. He was sentenced to two years in federal penitentiary followed by two years of probation. The four other accused took the stand in defence. They were all of the accused's friends. They beat the accused and stole his belongings. At the end of the attack, the accused threw a punch to the face and punched the other two members of his group. The three of them were police officers. The victim suffered serious injuries and severe bruising to his eyes, shoulder blades and temples, bruising to the ribs, a damaged left ear and a fractured skull were found as result of the assault. The accused was hospitalized for a time. He had a further exacerbation of his injuries when he was punched in the head and left for hospital. The Court imposed a sentence of two years probation."
1999skqb29.txt,"In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent. The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings. The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","FIAT. The applicants sought an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development connected to the Evergreen Centre. HELD: The respondents had met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting and the application was granted. The court found nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal or the meetings 'in camera' as the respondent had done throughout the application process. The issue was whether the proceedings in respect to the proposed hotel were invalid by reason of bad faith. The respondents met the prerequisites in that they had not obtained the required information from the applicants, had not taken steps to obtain it from the vendors, and had not proceeded to consider the proposal which was a substantial improvement on the already existing hotel. The proposal was considered but the proposal was not granted on the basis of bad conduct. The applicant sought an Order prohibiting the respondents from holding any public meetings and from further considering an application for a discretionary use permit by the applicant.

2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The appellants appealed their summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence set aside. 1)It was not necessary to retry the case in any event. The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal right and the test that s.11.1 (3) was based on the Sparrow test. The court found that s11.0(3)(a) did not infringe aboriginal rights and, in any case, the infringement was justified. 2)The appellant did not demonstrate that they were Indians within the meaning of s.7(1)(a)(a); the trial judge did not err in law in questioning whether the appellants had aboriginal hunting rights; rather, he found that the right to hunt at night with an artificial light was so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right. 3)The trial judge was correct in holding that s7(a)(i) was a provincial law of general application and did not extinguish or diminish the right of the appellant to hunt. The issue was whether the limiting legislation was a prima facie infringement of the appellantants' Aboriginal right and, if so, whether it was justifiable. 4)The court was unable to accept the appellans' argument that the trial trial judge erred in law when he interpreted s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement (NRTA) so as to deprive them of their aboriginal right to hunted at night. The appellantants had been denied their right to a search light by the trial court."
2003skqb550.txt,"The respondent seeks an order prohibiting the petitioner from removing her son from Saskatchewan until she obtains a Court order allowing her to do so. The child is the petitioner's son from a prior relationship. The petitioner plans to have the child live with his biological father in Edmonton so that he can get the specialized medical care that he requires. When the petitioner and the respondent separated, they consented to a judgment, which granted the petitioner custody of the child and gave access rights to the respondent. The consent judgment provided that the petitioner was to provide the respondent with 90 days notice of any proposed change in the child's residence. Notice of the upcoming move was provided to the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. The consent judgment does not require the petitioner to get an order before changing the child's residence. An application will be required by the petitioner to vary the access arrangements with the respondent.",The respondent had two children from two prior relationships. The eldest resided with her mother in Swift Current and the second child lived with her father in Edmonton. The respondent sought an order prohibiting the petitioner from removing the child from the province until she obtained a Court order allowing her to do so.

It only provides that the respondent receive 90 days' written notice. The petitioner was informed verbally of the proposed move in September or early October. The father was to provide 90 days notice.
2008skqb33.txt,"The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules striking paragraphs of the amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the statement of claim to remain would be an abuse of process. The paragraphs of the amended statement of claim at issue deal with the fact that the plaintiff alleges he was assaulted by the defendant and sustained bodily harm. The defendant was charged with assault, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. The issue is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceedings on the subsequent civil proceedings. HELD: The paragraphs of the statement of claim at issue do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial is inadmissible in a subsequent civil trial as proof that the party did not commit the offence.  2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the Crown against the defendant, the Crown bore the onus throughout to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence did not apply and the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings. In the civil proceeding, the plaintiff is in a position to control the presentation of his case and must prove his case on a balance of probabilities. The onus of proving self-defence is on the defendant. He bears the onus of proving the assault was justified and was made with reasonable force.","Civil Procedure – Rule 173 – Rule 165 The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules striking paragraphs 10, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 from the plaintiff's amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the statement of claimed to remain would be an abuse of process. HELD: 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal proceeding is inadmissible in a subsequent civil proceeding as proof that the party did not commit the offence. The plaintiff bears the onus of proving his claim on a balance of probabilities. 2) A defendant who is a witness for the Crown in unsuccessful criminal proceedings should be entitled to proceed independently in subsequent civil proceedings against the same defendant. The Court's sole focus in this case was whether the Provincial Court judge had erred in his application of the law with respect to the defence of self-defence. The issue on appeal is whether the Crown bears the burden of proof presented throughout the proceeding, which bears the balance of credibility on the defendant's position throughout the process."
2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","The appellant sought a declaration to this effect from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The court struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. The appellant appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the court found that the appellant's proposed interpretation of s. 36 of the Constitution Act was not a reasonable ground to strike the claim. The claim must survive unless the court makes a finding that the government has breached its constitutional commitment to the grant. The Court also found that, in the clearest of cases, where it is plain and obvious that the claim is not justiciable, the appeal can be allowed."
2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.","The applicant was disabled and appealed the decision of the Income Assistance Appeal Board which terminated his income assistance in May 2006. He re-applied for income assistance a second time in 2007. This time, the application was again denied. This was because the applicant had not requested further information. The applicant appealed the Board's decision and the appeal was heard by the Assistance Appeal board on September 6, 2007. The Board allowed the appeal and found that the applicant was 'a person in need' as defined in the Employment Support and Income Assistance Act. The board ordered that his assistance was to be effective the date that he was assessed. The application for an order in the nature of mandamus was granted. The court found that there was a clear legal right established to have the decisionof the Appeal Board enforced. The fact that the board so erred, the respondents argued, was that the Director and the Social Services Committee were bound by that decision and were entitled to implement the Appeal board's decision. The Court granted the application for the application in the form of mandamamus. The reason for the denial was that there had not been further disclosure by the applicant's counsel as required by the Act. Further disclosure by an applicant would not bind the Department if it chose to request further information from the applicant."
2010skpc153.txt,"The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations. The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch. The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one. The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations. The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door. The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts. It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue.","The accused was charged with operating a fishing truck without a licence contrary to s. 11(1) of the Fisheries Regulations and with operating without a valid driving licence contrary (Saskatchewan s. 13(1)) of the Act. At the close of the Crown's case, defence brought a Charter application challenging the constitutionality of s. 35 of the act, alleging it breaches s. and 11(d) of The Charter of Rights. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of s 27 of theAct. The Court dismissed the application. There had not been a valid ministerial order pursuant to s 27."
2011skca19.txt,"The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Crown had previously sought leave to argue its appeal. The accused was charged with assault contrary to s.(1)(a) the Criminal code. The Provincial Court found the accused guilty of the offence and granted him a conditional discharge with a probation period of 9 months. On appeal the Queen's Bench judge quashed his conviction and ordered a new trial. HELD: The appeal was allowed orally. The Court found that the trial judge did not direct himself to all of the relevant evidence, and in particular the trial Judge focused on the fact there were two officers present. The trial judge also found that (1) the accused's mistake of fact was reasonable, but he did not address the appellant's statement that the finger incident occurred twice and he did Not address the respondent's evidence that he viewed the person he viewed as a threat to the officer. The Appeal judge erred in both ways. The failure on the part of the trial court to consider the respondent’s mistake of facts and to assess the proportionality of his response was not an unreasonable conclusion. The appeal judge reviewed the issues and found that: 1) the trial trial judge was not trying to take the respondent into account; 2) the judge was trying to gauge the actual threat, if any, faced by the accused; and 3) the reasonableness of the accused’ s belief that he was being threatened. The respondent was not touched by the officer nor did the officer attempt or threaten by an act or gesture to apply force to the appellant. The officer at the scene did not feel endangered and at no time took any steps such as pulling out his baton to deal with a dangerous or threatening situation. The force used by the trial officer in reacting to the perceived threat was justified. The court was not entitled to overturn the conviction."

Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, aged 13, 15, 16, 17 and 18. The primary issue between the parties was custody of the children. Ancillary to and dependent upon the determination of the custody issue, is the quantum of child support that will be payable by either party. The mother, who had recently moved from Prince Albert to Alberta, had special needs that required consistency and stability to ensure she did not regress. The father, who was currently living in the United States, was working and living in a common law relationship. The parties lived in the same home for several years and it was during this time that the mother began to develop new friendships and began to visit the father. The children were in the joint custody of both parents and there was no evidence of the increased costs of shared custody as determined by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of those children. HELD: The children's best interests were found to be in the custody of [C.O.] and [K.O.' and they resided an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. 1) The mother was to receive counselling. 2) The father was to reside an equal time in both homes. The child support was to be determined by the amount of child care and access paid by each party. 3) The uncontradicted evidence indicated that the most important consideration for these children now was stability. That stability was found in their father's home. Neither appeared to have any meaningful appreciation that move to Clareshorn, six hour drive from Saskatoon, would have any significant impact on the quality or quantity of contract that the children would have with their father. 4) The children had a normal daily routine and were doing well in school. The parents were able to communicate and co-operate with one another. The son was doing well academically and had a reduced time to school. 5) The parents lived in a shared custody arrangement as contemplated by s. 8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. The daughter was doing better in school and the son was making better progress in the program. The fact that the father was working at a financial institution and living with his mother was of particular importance. The evidence was that the son's educational needs would be met in Clareshorne, but he was not aware that the daughter lived in Saskatoon. The uncontested evidence indicated the father's ability to support himself financially and physically supported himself. The Court found that the"

The parties agreed in 1997 that the father should have interim custody. The mother argued that she was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization for unipolar/clinical depression. The father had been employed as a long distance trucker but now worked days in the city. HELD: The applications for custody were dismissed. Overnight access was granted to the mother. 1)The application ignored the consistent law which states the courts should not vary interim custody arrangements whether legal or de facto in the absence of evidence that the child(ren) are in some way at risk, or other compelling reason. It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. The non-primary care parent should proceed to final order which in this provicne means obtaining a pre-trial date for a pre-trial conference and proceed to trial if custody is not resolved at that stage. 2)The court was satisfied on the basis of a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health was stable that the child was not at risk if the mother were granted overnight access.","FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage, born May 1993. The parties agreed that the husband would have interim sole custody. By an agreement in November 1997 the wife was diagnosed with unipolar/clinical depression and had just been discharged from hospital. She was diagnosed as suffering from unipolar clinical depression and underwent treatment for depression. She had just commenced kindergarten. The husband had recently been discharged. HELD: The application for interim care was dismissed. The court found that it constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error to vary interim custody arrangements pending trial in the absence of any evidence of risk to the child. The respondent was the more loving and caring parent. The child was in kindergarten for 1 1/2 years. The wife was to have access every Tuesday and Thursday from 1:00 p.m. until 7:30 p.M. and alternate Sundays from 10:00 a.m.-7:30p.m.. The applicant's basis for seeking the change in interim custody was that she was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization as the respondent was employed as a truck driver. After the agreement was entered into, the respondent changed jobs and moved from Saskatoon to Saskatoon. The application was dismissed with the exception of the alternative variation in access."
2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","The wife sought to improve her economic prospects and sought to ameliorate the unequal division regime which the husband registration imposed. She was awarded $1,945 on the counter petition. The husband was awarded only $2,000 against the matrimonial home. HELD: The husband's assets were equally divided. He was awarded the $25,000.00 against the home. The wife was awarded nothing against the property. Under s.22 of The Matrimonial Property Act, 1997, it was recognized that most often the young children of a previous marriage remain in the custody of the mother and so discretion was given to judge to amalterate the equal division regime. This has special application to the matrionial home as the wife was the one who brought the claim against the house. The court rounded out the numbers and ignored the fact that the mortgage on the matonial home was reduced by about $10,000 during the period in question. Both parties had the benefit of the matramonial home during the marriage. The claim was inequitable and should have been dealt with with a counter petition, there would have been no division, no trial and no excessive legal costs."

2_2000skqb111.txt,"The plaintiff claimed damages for failure to perform as agreed in constructing a residence. Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower. The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D&S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence. The defendant resisted the claim and by way of a counterclaim sought judgment for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $4,007.83. 1) The plaintiff never incurred the cost of repairs. However, he demanded they be effected and withheld $4 million to ensure compliance. The plaintiff moved off this position only when he was forced to in order to effect sale. This was a case of mistaken identity. 2) The appraiser was not a party to the proceedings as he was not the plaintiff's appraiser. He spoke only of minor repairs and did not act as a party against the defendant. 3) The cost of performance was $1,000. The diminution in value was the same amount as that of the claim. The court reviewed the whole of the evidence and concluded that the testimony of the plaintiff was the accurate account. The judge dismissed the claim of over $3,000 for diminution of value. 4) The claim of interest was dismissed. The amount of the mortgage interest was not recovered. 5) The defendant did not press on as might have been expected. He did not ensure that the program of construction was clearly defined and adhered to. Only an estimate was provided and some tolerance should be allowed. 6) The Court found that the defendant did have a duty to pay for extras which were not a part of the contract but were being requested. The Court awarded the plaintiff $1 million. The claim against the mortgage insurer was dismissed because the defendant had not acted as a Party to the Accident."
2_2001nssc171.txt,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The tenant entered into a two-year commercial lease with the intention of fixing the problem by arbitration. The landlord challenged the arbitrator's jurisdiction to award damages, arguing that the award should be quashed. The tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrators quashed on the grounds the arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the decision was patently unreasonable. The arbitrator was appointed by the court to deal with the issue of jurisdiction of the arbitration clauses. The tenants argued that the arbitration agreement did not provide that all disputes between the parties are to be settled by arbitration, but only disputes with regard to clauses of the lease. The issues of responsibility for repairs, whether the loss was covered by insurance and whether notification or claim was required were issues within the jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The arbitration clause in both the buildings was a very narrow interpretation of the Arbitration clause and it did not include a waiver of estoppel. The decision of the landlord was pathetically unreasonable. Both parties agreed that the standard of review was correctness. The court adopted the reasoning in Lachance v. Lifchus and the related decision of The Rental Home Trust and the Ontario Court of Appeal and concluded that the wider scope of judicial review was warranted. The more specialized the tribunal the less inclined the courts should be to be to interfere with its awards. The Court also concluded that it was incorrect in assuming jurisdiction to apply the principle of estopel against the Tenants. The trial judge concluded that there was a need for a particularly restricted scope for judicial review in the case of consensual arbitrations. The award of damages was awarded in the amount of $318,252.00 for repairs and $59,130.34 for loss of rental opportunity. The judge found the arbiter liable to the landlord in the sums of $59.5 million for repairs but awarded damages against the tenant. The appeal judge concluded: 1) the arbitration clause is a limited arbitrator and the jurisdiction is a discretionary one. The principles of waiver and estoppela apply as against the applicant in these circumstances. 2) The arbitrators are properly authorized to communicate with the landlord and to communicate to the tenant the decision of their interpretation of certain clauses and provisions of the property. The parties did not have the authority to communicate directly with the tenant and to deal parol evidence. 3) The principles and waiver and claim evidence respecting the interpretation of clause or provisions of a lease are not patently inconsistent with the principles of esto- estoppelle which are applicable in"

In addition to the child support ordered in the Corollary Relief Judgment, the husband had signed a document in which he agreed to repay the costs of the daughter's American student loans (which had to be obtained in the wife's name as the wife was an American). The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation. Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'. There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties.","The father, who was the only family member who could secure loans to pay for his daughter's education, applied under Rule 14.25 to strike out the mother's application. The mother sought a variation in relation to spousal support and a retroactive child support order, both designed to cover her past educational costs. Application to strike, in part, dismissed; the father had complied with his child support obligation as set out in the corollary relief judgment and there was nothing to enforce. The father's application for a retroactivity order succeeded. The only change in circumstances was that the daughter had secured several loans to help pay for her education. The loan payments were made to the daughter, pursuant to the parties separation agreement, and were part of her university education. There was no evidence that the loans were secured against her or her ability to pay them off. The daughter's educational expenses were covered by the loans.

By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action. In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs. Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609.","FIAT. By fiat of May 27, 2004 the defendants in the action were entitled to examine a representative of 609 for discovery and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for the action.

The questions centered on whether there was any right of privilege as between 609 and Henry, it was not right to appear personally in court on behalf of the company in such an action, but rather a party's rights and responsibilities within the action and the questions raised by the participants. The plaintiff and defendants who have status in this proceedings were not the defendants, the board members of 608 and the directors of the defendant company."

The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent, resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and was sentenced to nine months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The offence took place in Yorkton. The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck, finding the respondent was low risk to reoffend and of no real danger to society. The father was depressed and remorseful. The trial judge found the truck was used for the trafficking contrary, but had registered no lien to protect his interests. The judge refused the respondent's request for notice and ordered forfeiture. The truck had value of approximately $20,000. It was owned by the respondent and paid for through a loan from his parents. The Court found that 'basically all of the money to pay for the truck came from the parents' bank account to the kid to pay the truck'. The father had no previous record. He was a first-time offender with no previous criminal record. The sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range but there was no basis for interfering with the sentence imposed. A more significant issue was the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeited of the vehicle. The respondent had used the truck to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and deliver them. The court found that the truck had a low end end of range but it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The conviction was upheld on appeal. The appeal against the sentence and the appeal against it was allowed in part. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The full sentence was allowed and the truck is ordered forfeited. The accused was ordered to forfeit the truck. The impact of an order of forfeiture on the immediate family of the person charged or convicted of the offence was at a very low range but the Court found there was NO basis for interference with the sentencing. The offender was found to have in his home a significant amount of cash and marijuana. The evidence showed that the respondent wasn't trafficking out of his truck. He wasn't trafficked out of it. The fact that the father was a high risk to offend and of minimal danger to the society did not affect the forfeiture."

The value for distribution is set out in the value of the home as of the date of application. 2) The evidence was placed before the court as it was as it should have been.

The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) upheld the appellant's claim for 'accident' and the Workers' compensation Appeals Tribunal upheld the respondent's decision to exclude the respondent from the definition of 'personal injury by accident' (GECA) and the appellant appealed. The appeal turned on one main issue: whether the Workers’ Compensation Appeals tribunal (WCat) wrong to assess the nature of the workplace events and stressors from an objective point of view. The appellant’s evidence about the nature and extent of the events which he claimed gave rise to the GECA was found to be inconsistent with the approach required under the Policy. The respondent had often decided that it was not compensable under GECA. The Court reviewed the state of the law at the tribunal level and found that there were no workplace stressors which could have been compensable. The Policy set out the conditions under which each type of stressor was capable of being subjected to the workplace. The Appeal Commissioner’ s reasoning process was unreasonable and there was uncertainty about whether gradual onset stress was compensable at all under GCA. The issue at the heart of the appeal was whether the Policy was wrong to take this approach and if not, whether WCAT applied it unreasonably to the worker’S situation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court reviewed the history of the tribunal and found there was no inconsistency in the approach used by WCAT. The policy set out certain conditions which must be met, including the requirement that the stressors be viewed objectively as set out in the Policy and that the factors giving rise to their condition must be determined by an objective approach. The decision of the Appeal Commissioner was reviewed for correctness. The following issues were reviewed: 1) The Court found that the policy was correct to include gradual onset onset stress (the term gradual onset trauma) and that such an approach was the correct one, both under Policy 1.3.6 and under the general law applying to GECA claims in Nova Scotia. The approach used in the decision was consistent with the principles of the trial court in Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick (2009 SCCLII) and was consistent throughout with the rest of the decisions made by the trial courts. The trial judge did not err in relying on the objective approach required by the Policy; she did not fail to give adequate weight to the opinion of the respondent’d police officer in the absence of evidence to rebut that opinion; and the appeal commissioner did not erred in"

It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","The Landlord and Tenant appealed an order of the Director allowing the Landlord $787.50 as compensation for what the Director found to be a breach of the statutory condition to provide premises suitable for habitation. The Landlord had allowed mould to develop in her basement and had failed to rectify the problem. The Tenant's belongings were ruined. Photographs of the mouldy conditions were placed in evidence. She testified that there simply was no mould. The landlord used grey spray paint to resemble mould. She wondered why if there was mould that only affected the Tenant’s furniture and area rug and was not obvious on the other carpeting. The two versions of the facts were as far apart as they could be. The bylaw inspector’ s report was found to have detected mould and the conditions allowed mould. He found it impossible to believe that the Tenante, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away it. Having heard and assessed the Landowner as credible, it was impossible to disbelieve her that she would have resorted to that tactic. Having seen the photos and heard the Landlords testimony, it is impossible to doubt that the landlord, had he not been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint, would not have resorted. Having been assessed as credible and assessing her as credible she was not credible, the Court rejected the Land's evidence entirely. The damages were much higher than the $862.50."

He failed to take every precaution that is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health andsafety of persons at the workplace. The guilty plea relates to the fact that there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. The defendant had been out all night, had been drinking and had not slept. He had made substantial changes to his farm since the tragedy of the dairy farm worker who died in the manure pit. He was in no condition to operate equipment which he needed to remove manure from the pit and had been advised by his employer that a new one was on order. He also had a prior record for Occupational health and Safety offences. The Court accepted the submission that a $25,000 penalty is a significant penalty and that it should include a significant contribution to farm safety initiatives. The farmer's failure was mitigated by the defendant's lesser degree of culpability in not securing the barricade which had its damaged barricade removed while a new order was on Order. The farmworker had taken steps to improve safety at his farm including building a new dairy barn and installing a new gate."
2_2011skqb102.txt,"The Crown appealed the respondent's acquittal on a charge of driving over .08. The Crown alleged that the trial judge erred in law by excluding two breath samples taken following the respondent's arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter of Rights. During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence. HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered. The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter. The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted as a full exhibit and became part of the Crown's case. The Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt in all respects.","The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of impaired driving. The Crown claims the trial judge erred in law in excluding two breath samples taken after the arrest of the accused on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge did not fail to fulfil the objective grounds for the demand. The Court must consider the subjective and objective grounds of the demand, the fact that the accused was inebriated, the accused's driving actions, the manner in which he was attempting to orient himself and the fact he was trying to find his bearings all support the objective evidence of impaired driver impairment. 2) The accused was cooperative and did not ask what was going on in his head. He was not drinking. 3) The breath samples were taken as soon as practicable after the time the accused left the vehicle, not later than 2 hours after that time, with an interval of approximately 15 minutes between the times when the samples were received. The observations of the arresting officer upon which the officer formed reasonable and probable grounds that he was impaired and the manner of the samples obtained were objective evidence that the Court could not reasonably conclude that the impaired driver was impaired."
2_2012nssc359.txt,"Rule 77.01 – Scope of Rule 77 This is a costs decision following litigation between the mother and father regarding apportionment of custody and access rights, quantification of child support and special expenses for the parties' children. The mother was the successful party and income was imputed by the court to the respondent.  Held, costs in the amount of $3,000 are awarded against the father. The father's position caused unnecessary time, effort and delay. The court referenced L. (N.D.) v. L. (M.S.) (2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77. Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs.","The parties litigated the apportionment of custody and access rights and the quantification of child support and special expenses for their two children. The respondent did not persuade the Court to reduce his child support obligation. The matter required court time on two days and additional chambers time when the Court was required to resolve disagreements between the parties. The Applicant successfully applied for an award of costs valued at $3,000 based on an application of Scale of Tariff 'A' of the Costs and Fees Act. The trial did not involve a substantial amount of legal expenses but the resulting reduction in total income serves to diminish the litigant's tax bill. The parties litigated the appellment of child and access right and the quantitative quantification for child support, and the issue of costs claimed by both parties was central issue. Income was imputed to the respondent by the Court. The father did not prevail. Income and party costs must be fixed in accordance with the tariffs. The tariff is reproduced following Rule 77.18. The costs award was based on the tariff set out in the Rules. The court reviewed the relative success of the parties and assessed the relative'success' of them and the presence or absence of offers to settle. The evidence established that the respondent was the appropriate primary care parent. The appellant's initiative in seeking to vary the existing order was not reasonable and responsible. The Court held that if the court is to make a costs award, it must first deem the award of Costs warranted, as mandated by Rule 77(1), party and party cost fixed in the tariffs; the tariff is applicable to all costs awarded."

Dismissing the appeal, that the trial's instruction to the jury contained several serious errors. The trial judge's instruction contained several grave errors; the most serious being the instruction as to the requisite intent for murder.

The trial judge failed to address this evidence, thereby committing a palpable and overriding error.","The appellant was convicted of nine charges of break and enter and one charge of assault. He requested that his statements be excluded from media reports and asked the Youth Court judge if he could make any findings of fact or determinations of credibility on the remaining eight charges. The judge found that it was the defendant's sister and girlfriend who had encouraged him to give a statement. The defendant then asked the police officer if he was willing to give statement admitting to all of the charges he was involved in. The officer told the appellant that if he gave a statement and cooperated he would recommend that he be given a lighter sentence, two years instead of three. The appellant refused to give an answer to this question and asked what the police judge's guarantee was regarding the statements made by the defendant. The youth appealed.

She relied upon Civil Procedure Rules 15.07 and 15.08. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's application was an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of past circumstances of the child rather than an assessment of her current circumstances. The proper remedy would be for the applicant to apply for a termination of the order under s. 48 of the Children and Family Services Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of a Family Court judge declining to rescind an order in 1993 for permanent care and custody of the appellant's granddaughter. The appellant's husband reported the problem to the agency it sought its intervention because he alone could not care for the child. The basis on which the application was made was that the appellant consented to or agreed with the 1993 order on the faith of the agency's then plan of care which envisaged that adoption plans would be initiated by the appellant. Unfortunately, the adoption plans did not materialize because the mother had a drug dependency problem and by June 1995 was hospitalized. The husband reported to the Family Court it sought intervention because his alone could no care for her child. He sought rescission of the order on Rule 1.04 of the Family Code Rules. The Family Court Judge in rejecting the application dismissed the appeal.

3_1999skqb140.txt,"An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","The only witness called at trial was the plaintiff. The action was brought against the defendant, Hyndman, for breach of contract and for repairs. The defendant entered into a verbal agreement whereby the parties agreed that the repairs would continue for as long as the trucks were in the possession of Standard and operating under the authority of HyndMan. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed.  1)There was no specific contract with respect to the repair of the vehicles. Although there was no definite contract with regard to the repairs, it was clear that the defendant had made some payments on behalf of the plaintiff and that there was a purchase order number obtained from the defendant. 2)The plaintiff did not know how the repairs were authorized for Standard. 3)The defendant knew at that meeting that there would a risk to the arrangement because of Standard's insolvency and that Redhead might not be paid on the leases.  4)The actions taken by both Redhead and Hyndmans were taken for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.

3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of the defendant's cattle getting into her canola field in late July, 1999. The plaintiff admits that his cattle were in the plaintiff's crop on one occasion but denies liability. The defendant denies any liability under s.27 of the Stray Animals Act and further denies that he was negligent in looking after his cattle. HELD: Judgment was granted in favour of the plaintiffs and together with pre-judgment interest from January 2000 and costs. The damages sustained by the plaintiffs were as follows: 1)The plaintiff was responsible for crop loss; 2)The defendant's cows were in his canola crop on more than one occasion and that other cattle were not in the field. 3)The judge found that the cattle were found to be the cause of most of the crop loss. The judge found the damages sustained were reduced as a consequence of the cattle getting in the canola. The law in Saskatchewan is clear that cattle owner is liable for such loss as is caused by the entry of his cattle into the crop of another. The Court awarded costs to the plaintiffs."

These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired. The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients. 3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice. 4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants. The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods. 5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","The applicant sought interlocutory injunctive relief on a quia timet basis and to enforce what the applicant says are restrictive covenants, obligations of confidentiality and fiduciary duty binding on the respondents. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) The applicant failed to demonstrate a prima facie case or even a serious issue to be tried that it was in law entitled to more than two weeks notice or that the respondents were in breach of any right which accrued to Danka.  2) The injunty relief as a whole seeks to enforce certain restrictive coords, restrain employees from competitive activity pending the expiration of reasonable notice periods and generally restrain all respondents from any direct or indirect dealings with customers of Danka or pertaining to equipment sold or leased by Danka Canada Inc.  3) The employer or employer is in law obliged to give reasonable notice of an intention to terminate the relationship until after their respective contracts of employment have been terminated by the expiry of reasonable period of notice. In the event that Danka's customers are attracted from its former customers, the issuance of such a notice will not be allowed. 4) The application to strike the respondent's employees for breach of contract was dismissed. The respondent had not established a primari facie ground of imminent danger of substantial damage.  5) The Court found that the respondent had failed to establish a primacy case or a serious issues to be had. The application lacked a primure to establish that the confidentiality covenants and non-solicitation agreements which it had obtained from the respondent were enforceable.  6) The respondent failed to show a primamitas case or an issue to the Court that it is in Law entitled to at least two weeks' notice or a fair trial. The Court was also required to consider whether the respondent breached its obligations to protect its property and interests."

After two years, the relationship between the Respondents and the Mother broke down and she left their home. The Respondents sought and were granted custody of the child. The Mother appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Respondents had sufficient interest under s.6 of The Children's Law Act to seek custody of the child. 2)The trial judge correctly determined that the only issue was the child's best interests, even in a contest between a parent and a stranger, although the parent/child relationship was one factor to be considered. 3)The findings of the trial judge were strongly supported by the evidence, the law was correctly applied, and therefore his decision ought not be overturned. 4)The matter was returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access.","The appellant, who is mentally handicapped, appeals the entrusting of custody of her five year old son to the respondents.

The relationship between the appellant's mother and the respondents broke down and she left the care of the respondents on May 30, 1992. The appellant appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge erred in finding the respondent had sufficient interest within the meaning of s.6 of the Children's Law Act and therefore status within that Act. 2)The respondent had no'sufficient interest' within the Meaning of s6 of The Children's law Act and thus status, a decision with which the trial judge agree, the trial court judge then had to decide the issue of custody. 3)The court's role is not to determine broad social issues but instead to determine what custodial arrangement is in the child's best interest. This rule prevails even in contests between a natural parent and a stranger. 4)The Court's task is not solely to decide whether mentally challenged parents can be taught to care for children, but instead, in who's care will [A.]s best interests be advanced. The trial judge made no order as to costs but cross-appealed for costs.

The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions. The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue. The mother sought sole custody with generous access. The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication. Allowing the mother's application, that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say. Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues.

After the husband's retirement, the wife sought to receive her share of the pension from the employer as a lump sum. The husband objected, claiming that he was entitled to any remaining benefit from her share in the event she should predecease him. The wife applied for directions.

4_1996canlii6841.txt,"The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax. Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications. The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately. The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board of Revenue Commissioners reversed. The appellant had appealed under s. 21 of The Revenue and Financial Services Act. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The documents in issue were not ordered for resale. They were merely shipped to the destination designated by the appellant which in the boards' view would not represent the requirement of being 'published' as provided for in the Act. The purpose for which the documents were ordered was to be published and that they contain no advertising. 2)The Board determined as finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use in Saskatchewan and it was open to them to come to that conclusion. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly. 3)The respondent appealed under S. 21(1) of the Act which provides that on an appeal the facts are deemed to have been conclusively established by the findings of the board unless made on evidence which does not warrant that finding. Hearsay: The Court's role is supervisory in nature. Questions of law are within the purview of the Court. On questions of fact the Court's job is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not warrants findings of fact made by the Board. The alternative does not focus on the extent to which the purchase of the documentation is an independent purchase but rather the purpose for whom it was produced, distributed and made available.

He was 43 years old and a former Chief of Police for the Town of Kentville. He had held a position of trust in the police department during the course of his career. He used his position of authority as police chief to commit these offences. The total amount of money involved for all five counts exceeds $64,000. He is 43 years of age and a retired police officer. He has grade 12 education. He also has a residence hall degree. He entered guilty pleas to three counts of false report and false report in the amount of $11,692.43. The defendant had received a combined sentence of four months for the offences against the Safe Graduation Fund and two counts of fraud in the amounts of $1,286.19.

4_1998canlii13643.txt,"The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act. The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the adjudicator's decision following a hearing pursuant to s. 62.1 and s.62.2 of The Labour Standards Act. The appellant's president did not examine his company's lease in order to determine whether the adjudication's finding that the respondent's employee had not frustrated or fundamentally breached her employment contract gave rise to the following issues: 1) Did the adjudicating adjudicator err in law by finding that respondent's conduct had not rendered the partiesincapable of performing their contractual obligations; 2) Whether the adjudicators exceeded his jurisdiction by holding that the employer, as the respondent\'s employer, had an obligation to attempt to resolve a matter of work difficulties that hadhibited her from reporting to work; and 3)Whether the adjudicated adjudicator acted well within his jurisdiction when determining what the terms of the respondent`s employment contract were and that Cajon had not fulfilled its obligations therein. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts, as he found them, in addition, his findings of fact cannot be said to be 'patently unreasonable' because there was some evidence upon which he could arrive at his conclusions. Although not all of the facts presented to him were known to the Court, his decision outlines some evidence on which he may have arrived at his conclusion. By not engaging in these further inquiries and efforts outlined above the respondent had not satisfied the adjudent that it was incapable of carrying out its obligations. The doctrine of frustration cannot be applied to the circumstances of this case. 2)The Court found that the adjudicate acted well in his jurisdiction and beyond his prerogative when determining whether the terms and conditions of the appellant's employee's employment contract and that the applicant had not satisfactorily fulfilled her obligations thereunder. The adjudicator did not interfere with the adjudicative process nor with the decision of the adjudications."
4_1999skqb3.txt,"The plaintiff was the coordinator of post-secondary education programs for White Bear First Nation, between 1990 until his termination in May 1997. The plaintiff managed post-secondary programs with an annual budget of $960,000, taught upgrading and university entrance courses, and supervised other teaching and support staff. In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs. There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict. The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct. The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal. The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause. HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed. The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct. There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance. The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract. Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed. Although the plaintiff had been treated unfairly, the plaintiff had not shown that the employer was guilty of harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious conduct.",The plaintiff sought damages for wrongful dismissal. He was a guidance counsellor for the plaintiff's education complex from 1988 to 1997. He remained in that position until his 1997 termination. In 1990 he became co-ordinator of post secondary education programs and remained in this position until terminated in May 1997. In 1997 he sought damages as he lost his job and lost his pension. He sought damages against the corporate board of directors for insubordination and damages for breach of contract. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded general damages and punitive damages. He will have his taxable costs of the proceeding plus all necessary disbursements reasonably incurred. 1)The plaintiff was not the only employee dismissed without cause during a currency of fixed term contract. An employee dismissed with cause during the currency of a fixed term is entitled to be paid for the whole of the term. 2)The onus of proving the existence of just cause always lies with the employer and it is not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the employee or dissatisfaction with his or her job performance. 3)The Court could not find any reason to believe that the plaintiff had acted insubordinate or had a lack of initiative or initiative on his part. The facts did not support the conclusion that he had acted in a fashion that offended the public or was in breach of his fiduciary duty. 4)The court could not determine whether the plaintiff’s damages were limited to the amount he was awarded as a result of the actions of the corporate boards.

In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","Land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval. The applicant applied for tentative subdivision approval in 1997 and received the same in 1998. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. The Applicant applied for final approval in 2000 and then in 1998 for a tentative subdivision bylaw. The development officer declared the application incomplete and declared the applicant's application in error. The municipality then declared the project in error and declared it incomplete. The appellant now seeks an order in the nature of certiorari quashing the development officer's decision and declaring the application in fact complete. HELD: The applicant's right to appeal is limited to an application for final subdivision plan approval. On the same basis, the Applicant is entitled to a declaration that the application is complete. The application is set aside. 1)The Municipality's reliance on s.278 of the Municipal Government Act in its submission that the higher road standard are applicable to this Application. The Municipality relies upon s. 278(1), (2)(f) and (g) which provide an application to be grandparented and, if the applicant receives a final approval, it should only appeal refusal to approve concept plan or tentative or final plan of a subdivision on the grounds that the decision of the development officers does not comply with the subdivision by law. 2)The applicant is entitled only to a declared declaration that it is complete, (again subject to non-contentious error in the plan)."

The Crown and the defence put forward a joint sentencing recommendation of two years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount of the fraud, which was all that the appellants had actually retained. The sentencing judge ordered full restitution. The appellants appealed; the Crown conceded that the appeal should be allowed. Allowing the appeal, that while the agreement reached by the Crown and the appellants was not binding upon the sentencing judge, the joint recommendation was a fit sentence; in the circumstances there was no sound reason for departing from it.","The appellants pleaded guilty to fraud over $5000 and were sentenced to two (2) years probation and restitution in the full amount of the overpayment. The Crown and defence advanced a joint sentencing recommendation for two (1) years of probation and 1/2 of the amount of fraud. The judge accepted the joint recommendation for probation but ordered restitution in full amount. The appellants applied for leave and, if granted, appealed the judge's decision to order restitution of the full sum rather than one-half of the sum as submitted in the joint recommendations. The appeal was allowed and the restitution orders were amended by reducing the amounts ordered to be repaid by one-third."
4_2005nspc10.txt,"The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking, cocaine for the purposes of trafficking and possession of property obtained by crime. The accused was a student at the time and had been seen on the wharf drinking beer. The police had noticed a large amount of alcohol in the area and noticed a bag of cash stuffed in the passenger seat. The officer went to move a knapsack on the floor to check for further alcohol and noticed it felt heavy. When he picked up the knapsock, it felt heavier and he could feel what he thought might be bottles of cocaine and cash. When the police entered the vehicle, they found a large quantity of cocaine, a large number of cash and a large sum of cocaine. The knapsacks were found in an open motor vehicle and were of the type used by drug traffickers to package cocaine. At the police station, they were found to contain three rolls of cash, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash. The three rolls were found, rolled to keep cocaine from clumping with moisture, rolled at the manner used by dealers to hold their proceeds of sale. The lotto forms were used to package the cocaine. Scales were used for weighing out the product. The cash was found in the back of a vehicle and was found to be in the hands of the accused. The defendant was a university student the previous year and unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that these rolls of money were proceeds of drug trafficking. The drugs and money were found at the hands and feet of the defendant."

HELD: 1) The plaintiff has failed to identify the legislative scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for education of a group of people that included the plaintiff, was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government. The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government sought an order requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars in order for it to properly defend the action and not be taken by surprise. The plaintiff cites samples of cases involving similar open ended phrases and submits that such wording is common and should be permitted by the courts. The conduct of examinations for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to proper defend the claim. The trial judge was not prepared to strike the phrases complained of. The practice of examinations in discovery and undertaking can provide a defendant with information as to the extent to which particulars can be given. The defendant is entitled to make and enforce regulations with respect to the standards of buildings, equipment, teaching, education, inspection and discipline in connection with residential schools for children. The Government is entitled, however, to strike these portions of the statement of claim. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff.  1)The pleadings do not meet the requirements of the pre-judgment interest Act. The evidence does not support the claim for breach of fiduciary duty or breach of trust. 2)The defendant is not entitled to strike all of the pleadings. The court was not able to strike them. The examinations for discoveries and undertakes can provide an opportunity for the defendant, in the conduct of which the pleadent shall be required, to establish the statutory arrangements and to establish certain provisions and provisions of the Act. 3)The conduct of the examinations for discover and undertow can provide such a person with particulars as may be required by law. The pleadings must be clearly and precisely defined. The defendants are not required to provide further particulars. 4)The plaintiff is entitled only to leave the matter to the trial judge. The claim is dismissed with double costs to which the offending party would otherwise be entitled. 5)The evidence is inadequate to properly establish the provisions of each Act or Act.

4_2006skca76.txt,"The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","The appellant appealed an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. The father paid some maintenance for the child and had extensive access to the child, she spending most of the time with her maternal grandparents. He alleged that the mother was an alcoholic and as result did not properly care for the children. The mother filed an affidavit denying all of the allegations, and in particular, that she was an addict and her alcoholism adversely affected the child. The appellant appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. Even assuming that the Investigation Record was admissible, given the direct denial under oath by the mother of either alcoholism or lack of proper care for her child, there should have been an order directing a trial of an issue rather than a decision made on the written evidence. Even if the hearsay were admissible the mother should have made an order directed at the father. Even though the mother's affidavits were based on hearsay, there was no case for even direction of the trial of any issue, let alone an order in favour of the father, given that the evidence of the expert and the psychologist had been previously made out. Even with the hearsays evidence, there wasn't even a case for an order for trial of this issue, and the father was awarded leave to reapply on proper evidence if so advised."
4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine. The plaintiff also claims damages for breachof an employment contract when the plaintiff employed Sullivan as a manager. Sullivan was no longer employed by the plaintiff and was now employed by PCS. The defendant argues that the plaintiff breached her employment contract by submitting a proposal to the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff is awarded costs against the plaintiff, the plaintiff is entitled to costs against Sullivan and the plaintiff amends the contract for an additional three months. The only issue is whether Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity. The law is clear that an employee is under an implied obligation not to compete with an employer during the term of his or her employment. Although Sullivan had given notice that he would no longer work for the plaintiff after September 30th, he was still employed at the time he submitted the proposal. The claim against PCS is dismissed. The trial judge erred in characterizing the plaintiff's actions as mere preparation. The position of Sullivan when he submitted his proposal was almost identical to that of the plaintiff in this case. He knew nothing as to profit margins, etc. of the plaintiffs company. He did not consider that to be confidential information or a trade secret. The fact that the bid was made two weeks before the contract ended, which persuaded him that her conduct was not breach of fidelity or a breach of his contract of employment. The sole issue is if Sullivan breached the duty of good faith by submitting his proposal to PCS when he was no more employed by her. Hearsay: The law in this province is well settled that an employer is underan implied obligation to compete during the period of his/her employment. It is well established that an individual who submitted a bid for a food services contract in competition to her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of her employment obligation. The Court of Appeal held that the respondent was not entitled to anything more than nominal damages and awarded it $500. The court awarded the plaintiff $500 against the respondent. The respondent is entitled only to costs. The employer is entitled in this matter to the defendant and the defendant is entitled here to costs of the action against the employer."
4_2009skqb403.txt,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","The applicant is 39 years old licensed practical nurse who is employed with the Mamawetan Health Region. She is married to a self-employed carpenter who also lives in La Ronge. They are the biological parents of three children. The applicant commenced a petition in October 2008 in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, The Children's Law Act, 1997, and Family Maintenance Act,1997. HELD: 1) The fact that one is not the biological parent of the children does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide financial support for that child. However, given the short-term relationship and the fact that the applicant has always been the primary caregiver of the three children, a modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem. 2) The respondent has always stood in loco parentis to the children, which is a prima facie case for entitlement. A modest transfer to the respondent of funds should alleviate some of the majority in the short term. The respondent may have stood in a loco parentalis to them. However the Court cannot determine that the respondent has ever sought or granted this relief. 3) The Court ordered the respondent pay the petitioner the sum of $1,500 per month. This amount is sufficient to relieve the majority from the economic hardship that she is experiencing as a result of the matrimonial breakdown."
4_2010skqb193.txt,"The litigation revolved around a claim by the plaintiffs for damages that resulted from a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006. In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery. HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence. Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery. In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery. The plaintiff was granted 40 days from the date of the order to reply to the demand for particulars.","FIAT: The plaintiffs were operating a tractor unit bearing Manitoba licence plates and pulling a semi-trailer bearing an Alberta licence plate. The plaintiffs, presumably husband and wife, were at all material times residents of the Province of Alberta. In August 2004, the plaintiffs were involved in a head on collision on a stretch of highway in the Province Of Saskatchewan. The defendant auto insurers of each of the three provinces are named defendants. Saskatchewan, at all times, was governed by a no-fault insurance regime. The plaintiff sustained 'right leg injury, lacerations, back injury and post-traumatic stress disorder' this being the language appearing at para. 8, 9 and 10 of the plaintiffs' statement of claim. The defendants applied for particulars of the plaintiff's statement of claims. Each defendant had furnished a draft order. HELD: The defendants' applications were granted. Each of the defendants was entitled to a further and better statement of the nature of their claim and to better particulars of any matter of which particulars should properly be given. The trial judge will be able to see the reply to demands for particulars and be better positioned to assess the merits of these motions than I was able to infer from the material presently before the court."
5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issues for resolution were divorce, custody and access. Divorce, custody, access and maintenance for the children were disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The eldest son claimed an interest in the standing crop but the respondent failed to give notice of his interest. The court valued the farm equipment at $300 per month and the petitioner's income at $11,376. The farm partnership had three children of its own. The oldest son claimed a interest in cattle, but the court did not find any evidence as to its value. The auction house had a value of $1,200 but it was found to be over $10,000. The petitioner's assets were over $20 million at the time of separation and she was entitled to one-half of the $1 million in assets. The appraised gross value of the farm land was $96,600 and there was no evidence as yet as to whether the cattle had been sold or retained. The average capital cost allowance taken on the farm was $1.5 million less $15,580 and was not included in the value of any assets. HELD: The respondent's income was fixed at $10 million and his adjusted income at the rate of $25,721.07. The Court declined to order any spousal support. The respondent is to pay $1 per month for the three children except for one child, who is to have one year of schooling and one year to have a year of maintenance. The other child is to be entitled to half of the cost of the farming operation. The three year average from line 150 of the tax return is $96. The amount of land owned by the respondent is $1/4 of the land owned before marriage and the average capital costs on the farming enterprise are $1-half less the amount of the assets in the possession of the petitioner. The farming operation was reduced to $1 acreage and the land was owned by one of the respondent's brothers. The father's income is to divide the proceeds of the operation by the number of children and the respondent will have one-third of the costs of the activities which the parties mutually agree upon. The parties agree that the respondent must pay half of all the costs which are set forth on Exhibits P-9, P-10 and P-ll and the one-off costs of any future extra-curricular activities which they mutually agree on."
5_2002skqb378.txt,"All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old. The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.","The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the respondent pay ongoing support for his granddaughter of $293 per month. The parties had been unable to reach an agreement regarding child support and had proceeded to trial. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the child support order should be retroactive; 2) whether costs should be added to the child's costs; and 3) whether a $20 expense for kindergarten could meet such a qualification. The respondent's income for child support purposes was $9,517.08 per year; given the respondent's limited income, a retroactive order was warranted."
5_2004skca52.txt,"This was an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision the arbitrator interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and the respondent. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The interpretation of the arbitrator was a possible interpretation on a legal and grammatical analysis of the entire agreement, and was not patently unreasonable.","This is an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision of Arbitrator Ish interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and respondent. The judgment centered on a clause governing retroactive retroactive pay. The appellant had argued that the phrase 'any employer' referred to the employer for whom the employee was working at the time. The respondent had argued the employee should be entitled to retroactive wage adjustments from every employer for him to retire. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The court found that the wording in question to be ambiguous and outlined the reasons why each of the competing interpretations might be chosen. He then concluded in his ratio of 1:1 that this was an error and patently unreasonable error. This is an incorrect proposition of law. The arbitrator went on to rely on the other provisions of the agreement, which were also reviewed. For this alternate ratio, the court found the union not met the burden of proof required on it on the balance of probabilities test."
5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.","The Students' Union and the Students'' Union appealed a Queen's Bench decision denying them standing to bring an application pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act. The issues in this case are the result of a referendum held in the fall of 2005. A majority of students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent applied to the Court of Queen'sBench pursuant to the Non-Provisional Improvements Act and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Students' union and the Union sought to overturn the order. The Chambers judge found that the Students’ Union had standing to apply and granted the relief. The issue in this application is whether the Students� Union has acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice. HELD: The appeals are dismissed with costs. 1) It is important not to confuse the statutory concepts of oppression, unfairly prejudicial actions and actions which unfairly disregard interests with respect to the referendum result. The Court of Appeal judge did not believe the controverted election jurisprudence was applicable to this case. Rather, relying on Walton v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association (1998), 166 Sask. R. 32 (Q.B.) and related cases, he concluded that the proper test for relief was whether the student body had acted in 'good faith and in accord' with the broad rules of natural law. 2) The Court found that it was entirely satisfied that the respondent was a 'proper person' to bring the application. He had standing and he was a reliable participant in the referendum process. He was a leading voice against joining the FSF. The FO filed an application for relief pursuant to s. 225(1)(a) of the Act. 3) The FO failed to bring its application on the ground that the Chambers judge had misinterpreted and misconstrued the Act and its provisions. The Chamber judge erred in finding that the University of Saskatchewan had 'imposed its own preordained outcome' by endorsing the referendum results. 4) The Students” Union and Union submitted that the applicant had standing but they failed to name a person who had been a 'performer' on the referendum. The applicant had not established a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the applicant. The fact that the Applicant had not been a party to the proceedings and had not participated in the process for the purpose of presenting its application to the Chambers court was irrelevant. The application was therefore premature and should be considered"
5_2011nssc53.txt,"A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate. In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister. The parties will bear their own costs. There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded. As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here. The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid. The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation? In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","The father sought party and party costs against his son. The father sought costs out of the estate. The issues were not about the meaning of his mother's will but about the failure of the representatives of the family's estate to provide an accounting. The central issue in the father's application was not about his mother’s will but rather the implied promise against revocation, which his father breached by making a will in favour of his sister after his mother died. The issue was whether the will could be relied upon as an implied promise, which the father breached when making a Will in favour his sister. The family had made a gift to the father in the hope that it would help his son in his quest to obtain a controlling interest in a condominium held jointly by his parents. The application was sham and the father and his daughter now acting on their own."

The plaintiffs brought a claim in contract and tort alleging Hagblom caused a fire in their building. The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation. The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence. In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. Leave was granted nunc pro tunc to bring third party proceedings. (1)The third party claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action. It was not plain and obvious the claim could not succeed.

Plaintiff awarded commission of 4% as agreed to by the terms of the oral contract; in the alternative, the plaintiff is entitled to an award for unjust enrichment to compensate for the work done. Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable. An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties.","The plaintiff broker, who was a former agent for the defendant, developed a small business selling property and selling commission on the basis of a 10% commission on a 'durable' land. He later retained a lawyer to help him with the marketing of the property. The lawyer was granted access to the lawyer's office for a time. After the lawyer left the office, the plaintiff asked to withdraw his claim against the defendant and requested that he pay less than the 10% he had been promised and that he would have to consult with his daughter and others about the business and marketing plan.

6_2002nsca46.txt,"The plaintiff appealed an interlocutory decision in which the chambers judge held that a non-party medical doctor who had provided emergency treatment to the plaintiff did not have to answer certain interrogatories on the basis that they required an opinion. The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial. Appeal allowed in part; the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given. Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided. However, opinions typically asked of an expert witness with respect to the medical services provided by the respondent that were not formed as part of his diagnosis and treatment of the appellant are not required to be provided. Interrogatories cannot be used to usurp the Rules surrounding the use of expert evidence.","The appellant commenced an action against the respondent physician alleging negligence in the performance of a circumcision. The respondent had performed the circumcision three days after the appellant went into the emergency department complaining of pain. The appellant commenced this action against him alleging negligence. The physician declined to be an expert witness in the action and provided the names of three other urologists whose names were provided by the appellant and declined to act as an expert witnesses. The chambers judge refused to appoint an expert and instead ordered the physician to answer all of the interrogatories, the majority of which call for his opinion concerning the medical services provided by him. The plaintiff alleged that the physician should be required to re-answer the interrogatory questions with the directive that he answer them fully and in language that is capable of being understood by a layman. The issue before the trial judge was not the issue raised by the expert but rather by the parties' objections to the appointment of the physician. The medical evidence raised by this expert was far less than the expert opinions raised by other physicians. The Court reviewed the relevant issues and found that the chambers judge erred in refusing to appoint the physician as an interlocutory expert and in refusing the physician's appointment as a court expert. The issues were: 1) was the issue of whether the physician in the position to whom the appellant was treated and treated as a result of the circumcision; 2) was it necessary for the physician who treated the appellant to answer the balance of interrogatories that required his opinion; 3) was he capable of providing opinion evidence simply because he was a subsequently treating physician to the appellant; and 4) was there any negligence that the appellant committed or anything that should have been done? The physician is not a party to the action. The doctor is not required to answer questions that call for opinions. The interrogatories are all interrogatories dealing with the treatment of the appellant. The only exception to this is interrogatories where the physician is required to provide an opinion. The majority of interrogatory interrogatories seek opinions about the respondent's care of the applicant. The opinions sought by the applicant in this case are opinions that are opinions which the appellant is entitled to answer. The court reviewed the circumstances and found it was not sufficient for the appellant not to have objected to answer some of the questions by simply stating they required an opinion; and 5) was not satisfied that the respondent erred by refusing to answer interrogatories which call questions that he did not ask but that he had previously answered. The appeal was allowed in part."

The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens.

The applicants did not really make any submissions of substance concerning forum non- conveniens and at the same time the applicants had not provided lot of information about the circumstances surrounding the accident such as whether any of the witnesses were resident; whether there were police reports; whether the plaintiff was seen by doctors; if so, where they were located. In the absence of so many facts about the accident and the witnesses likely to be called on behalf of the defendant, the plaintiff's choice of forum will govern. The court found that Nova Scotia is forum non convenediens. It is an entirely different question, as to what law will apply to a trial in Nova Scotia and, as I have previously stated, the rule is that the substantive law that governs will be the law of the place where the injury occurs. Nova Scotia has chosen Nova Scotia. The application was amended to include an additional claim for costs. The Court found that the applicants appeared to have argued determination of question of question law but the respondent had focused on forum non non convenien. The plaintiff has a prima facie right to select the forum of his choice and, according to the law in this case, that will undoubtedly be determined in accordance with the procedural law of that place of trial. Nova S.A. is forum conveniens, which is the province of Quebec. The Rule 25 rule is applicable to any proceeding in Nova Southeastern.

Subject to the parties reaching a different agreement, there would be an order that the child continue in kindergarten in North Battleford up to and including December 2004. The move to Saskatoon will affect the terms of the final order with regard to the parenting issue.

6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","The issue for the Court was whether Tristen was a 'child of the marriage' as defined by the Divorce Act (and, if so, what his obligation to pay child support should be). The parties married in 2001 and separated in 2008. The parenting and support issues concerning Tristena have been resolved. The issue for this Court is whether Tristeen is a 'Child of the Marriage' as determined by the Act (with or without the father) and what his obligations to pay Child Support should be. HELD: The Court held that the threshold for parental status finding is high and reserved for cases where a step-parent can be clearly shown to have assumed the role of the natural parent in substantial substitution for the natural parental role. The Court found that the respondent did not'stand in the place of a parent' when this decision was made. This was an important decision. The respondent stood in the Place of a Parent when the parental status determination was made and the Court awarded an award of $27,000 to the child. This amount was not increased over the course of a 10 month marriage. The child's relationship with the natural father was growing, not diminishing. The decision to allow the respondent to have contact with Tristene was made in an effort to minimize the number of persons paying child support in the country."

His creditors were put to the unnecessary expense by his frivolous or vexatious defence of their claim and he failed to comply with the duties of a bankrupt by failing to produce proper records and assist the trustee to the fullest. He has been abusive and disrespectful throughout.","The bankrupt applied for his discharge from bankruptcy. His statement of affairs showed assets of $171,255 (mostly exempt or encumbered) against unsecured debts totalling $433,750 and secured debt of $150,000. The bankrupt claimed that he had been insolvent since 2002 and that he relied on financing from the bank. He claimed that the drought had caused his operation to fail, and that his cattle operation had failed to meet his required monthly income. The bankruptcy judge found that the bankrupt had committed a serious mistake in failing to disclose his exempt farm assets and had made a mistake by refusing to disclose these assets. The court found that this was an appropriate ground to issue a conditional order of discharge. The defendant should be able to comply with the order by the end of February 2010 with half of his Judgment."
6_2012skqb275.txt,"The parties agree that joint custody is appropriate, but the petitioner mother asked that the principal residence of the two boys be varied and awarded to her. The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well. The children have been primarily residing with the father. The father has been in three motor vehicle accidents within three years and is facing criminal charges as a result of the most recent one. The father works long hours as a maintenance man. The mother has four other children from previous relationships. The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home. The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education. One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care. While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home. The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort. The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way. HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall. The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father. Joint custody was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines.","The parties met in 2000 and moved in with the mother. They lived together for several years. The mother later moved in to live with the father. They had two older children, aged 11 and 11. The oldest son, Johnathan, was in the military for a year and had graduated from high school. He was in trouble at school. The other son, a young man, had been in the Marines for a while and had expressed a fear of his stepbrother, Tyler, who was inebriated. The father had recently been charged with impaired driving causing bodily harm, dangerous driving causing harm and driving over '08. HELD: The parties were ordered to forthwith pay child tax benefits of $300 per month. The child support and employment supplement were to be paid by the parties. The petitioner was to supervise the boys' living arrangements. The issues were to determine the appropriate age for access by the court. The best interests test governs the determination on the issue of primary residence. The 'best interests' test governs whether the child shall have access to the mother and child tax credit. The respondent was to provide written assurances that the children would be provided with adequate access to their mother, including that they would receive regular weekly access to her home, and that any inappropriate contact with her would be strictly prohibited. The parties had no intention of pursuing mediation. The only other outcome of the pre-trial conference was an agreement to pursue mediation. Hearsay: The respondent is guilty of common sense, lack of candor, lackadaisical conduct and lack of concern for others. The Court cannot make the best decisions for the children."
6_2014skpc40.txt,"Criminal Law – Recognizance The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","The accused is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance. The Crown now applies for third recognizances. The issue is whether the recognizANCE should be granted again. The accused is A repeat violent offender who is still serving his sentence for a sexual assault conviction and out of a weekend pass when the last of the accused committed his final sexual assault offences against his niece. HELD: The accused was granted one recognizant. 1) The accused has 59 prior criminal convictions. The Court reviewed the officer's and the accused's individual circumstances and found that an objective person armed with the same knowledge would agree that the fears of Corporal Teniuk, and indeed Ms. Woytiuk, that the accused will commit a serious personal injury offence are reasonable. The only issue to be determined is whether that objective person agrees with the accused’s subjective belief that the defendant will commit another serious personal injuries offence or sexual assault. 2) The Court found that the officer’ s.810.2 recognizable and objective principles apply. The judge found that it was impossible to make generality of that sort of evidence. The officer”s professional experience was sufficient to justify the use of the term “expert” in the context of her job. The court found that there were significant gaps in the officer and the public” s.2”diversity” evidence. 3) The officer testified that she had worked with the Correctional Service of Canada for 29 years and had plenty of experience in the areas of assessing and supervising inmates while institutionalized. The fact that the offender had been denied programming by the prison system for 5 years and then reapplied for a third recognance in 2012 and 2013 did not outweigh the fact that she was unable to assess the officer because she was a parole officer."
6_2015skqb138.txt,"Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","FIAT: The applicant has not made out a genuine issue for trial to prove the 2013 will in solemn form. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The Court was satisfied that the applicant has failed to establish a genuine Issue for trial. The Court found that the respondent did not have the capacity to understand the nature of the document, its nature, its contents and its extent. The need for trial is short-lived.  2) The court was also satisfied that, in the perhaps unlikely event the propounder of the will somehow answers the concerns raised by the applicant with uncontradicted evidence affirming testamentary capacity. 3) The respondent did have the ability to provide support for the principles set out in the Ritchie judgment. The court found that it was necessary only to satisfy the court that there is a genuine issues to be tried with respect to the grounds on which the challenge is based, such as lack of testamentary strength or the presence of undue influence. 4) The test in Quaintance is, as is the general statement of the issue to be determined in Dieno, based in the context of jurisprudence respecting the wishes of testator and validity of will. The test here is whether the challenger of the Will can establish a valid issue for the Court to determine whether trial is warranted. The respondent has failed in this regard. 5) The evidence is inconsistent and inconsistent. The evidence does not support the idea that the test in Ritchie is warranted but rather a rebuttable presumption. The presumption simply casts an evidentiary burden on those attacking the will. It is necessary only for the challenger to satisfy that there a genuine problem to be attempted with respect the grounds upon which the challenged challenge is founded. The issue here is the respondent's failure to provide adequate support for his or her daughter to make proper decisions. The failure to act in accordance with the R. v. SCC decision of the Court of Appeal in R. No. 2 (dismissal of a claim) requires a trial to establish the testator's capacity to act properly. The Act is not a substitute for a trial."
7_1990canlii4117.txt,"Where the petitioner demonstrated that she did not upgrade her education during the marriage as a result of her attempts to become pregnant and thus there was a causal connection between the petitioner's need and the marriage, interim maintenance in the amount of $100 per month was ordered ,  having regard to the means, needs and circumstances of each spouse.","The parties were married fifteen years. There were no children. The petitioner wished to upgrade herself so she could obtain a degree. She spent a lot of time under medical care in an effort to become pregnant. She suffered a miscarriage while in the marriage. She was seeking maintenance. The parties were divorced in 1990. The respondent is employed by Public Works. He is employed as Public Works Canada. He worked considerable overtime in 1989 which brought his income up to $48,000. HELD: The respondent was awarded $500 per month interim maintenance. 1)It was inappropriate to award the requested amount of $500. The court could well take that into account if on the hearing of the divorce it was determined that the petitioner is entitled to periodic maintenance for a period of time. There was some causal relationship between the petitioner's attempts to become a pregnant and the fact that she did not upgrade her education during the marriage, the court found. 2)The petitioner should attempt to upgrade her educational qualifications. The Court was not satisfied that, even if it was a causal relationship, the petitioner would not be entitled to maintenance for any lengthy period of period of Time. It was appropriate to award a nominal amount plus a small lump sum with the sum to be paid to the petitioner."

The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order which determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the appellant's pension plan during negotiations during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with written reasons to follow. 1)The court reviewed the relevant case law and found that the appellant should be bound by her agreement asto its value. 2)The fiat in question was set aside and the amount of compliance was set alight. 3)The appellant should not be bound solely by his agreement as of its value; in all cases of settlement the agreement should be set aside as a matter of law. 4)The judgment in Zimmerman v. Childs Estate was overturned on appeal. 5)The money involved was set- aside and all concurring opinions and decisions were set aside except for those made by the trial judge. 6)Decisions in matrimonial property matters are rarely made lightly as there is no evidence to indicate that the agreement was made in a state of perfect harmony. 7)Decision in Zimmerman was set to follow on appeal and the same reasoning was applied in Childs."

The police had stopped the respondent when they observed the passenger putting on a seat belt. When the respondent went to the police cruiser, the police observed signs of impairment.

Allowing the appeal and restoring the conviction. Random stops are arbitrary detentions infringing the Charters. 9 but are saved by s.1. They are authorized in Nova Scotia under Motor Vehicle Act provisions. In the course of checking licences, registration, insurance policy and mechanical condition police are justified in making observations to detect drinking drivers; the right to counsel under s. 10(b) is suspended during this period.","The respondent was stopped by a plainclothes police officer (C.C.A.) on June 21, 1993. He was convicted of driving with an illegal blood alcohol level (BAA) after trial. The Crown appealed on the ground the summary conviction appeal court decision overturned the appellant's conviction on the basis that the police officer based her conclusions for the breathalyzer demand on observations made after she requested that the respondent accompany her back to the police cruiser. The C.C.'s lawyer argued that his s. 9 Charter rights had been infringed. Dismissing the appeal, that the C.A.A.'s and the SCC's, that there is no basis for a fifteen minute delay in circumstances where the results would be rendered totally unreliable and flawed. The broad discretion afforded to the officer to act reasonably in such circumstances is also a requisite for a reasonable and probable cause for such a search. The arbitrary detention of the appellant was justified because he was impaired by alcohol and because the officer gave a breathalyze demand without requiring a test with an ALERT screening device. The Court held that the broad discretion given to the discretion to the driver is a huge plus in this case. The appellant's right to retain and instruct counsel was infringed under s. 10(b) of the Charter."
7_1995canlii5894.txt,"The Defendants applied to sever the issues of liability and damages for purposes of the trial of this matter. The trial was to be held before a jury.HELD: 1)The Court has a general discretion as to severance of issues which must be exercised judicially. 2)Severance should only be ordered when the judge has a serious reason to believe that the trial of the issue proposed to be severed will put an end to the action. 3)The Court accepted the Plaintiff's submission that expert medical evidence would be necessary to establish the cause of the accident since the Plaintiff had suffered brain damage and would be unable to testify. This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found. 4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages. A jury cannot be disassembled and then recalled to conclude the trial of the remaining issues. 5)The Court was of the view that there should be compelling reasons before issues should be severed for trial, but that no compelling reason had been established in this case.","This was an application by the defendant for an order pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction severing the issues of liability and damages. The defendant argued that a trial of liability would be unnecessary given the quantum of damages claimed by the plaintiffs and given the volume of evidence necessary to prove the aspect of the claim, the prior determination of liability may result in a very significant reduction in trial time and costs. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1)If the issues are severed, it is at least arguable that the plaintiffs may well be disentitled from their right to have a jury trial. Such an examination will necessitate an examination of the injuries and how they sustained the injuries. Such a trial will require a level playing field and will require more than a trial with a single trial. 2)The plaintiff was not entitled to costs in the cause."

HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations.

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder.

Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings.

7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the Credit union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit University became tenant at sufferance when it failed to remove the quonsets and was obliged to pay rent. The Credit Union took the position that it should be re-imbursed either as Quantum Meruit or a tenant at will Gari for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. As a result, Gari’s claims in this regard must fail. 2) The evidence falls well short of proving that the plaintiff could have derived any rent from the property, had the building not been there, beyond the amount that the applicant actually recovered. The reasonable rental value can be estimated, albeit with limitations, by reference to the amount of improvement taxes the plaintiff had to pay to keep the town from taking the property for taxes. The evidence is well short-lived and falls well behind the damages determined in connection with the tenancy at sufferage issue. The Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the application. The plaintiff could not have derived rent from Garis land had the Building not been removed. The fact that the building was occupied by tenants and not occupied by financers was a factor. The court was unable to accept that the credit union could not be either a tenant or tenant at suffersance and thus liable for use and occupation of the property. The accused had a claim for rent and reimbursement for the unpaid taxes."

The Crown concedes that there is no reason to detain the accused youth to ensure her attendance in court or to prevent further occurrences. The Crown asks that she be detained because the crime is so horrible, the case is so strong and the public in La Ronge are so disturbed and shocked by the occurrence that to release the youth would cause a loss of confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: The court does not keep a person in custody simply because they are accused of committing an offence. There must be a necessary and substantial reason to keep a person in custody before they have a trial. The accused youth will be released on strict conditions that will continue until her trial is complete.","A horrible event took place which resulted in serious injury to a member of this community. Several individuals told the police that the accused youth is responsible for those injuries. The Crown conceded that there was no reason to detain the accused at the trial, and issued a number of conditions, including the release of the youth on strict conditions. The conditions were in order to allow the youth to have a trial with the Crown and to have her defence heard. HELD: The youth was released on strict condition that she show her face at her trial and that she had not shown any danger or danger to herself or anyone else.

A reasonable cause of action is disclosed. 2) None of the affidavits filed speak to the circumstance wherein the impugned remarks were made. Most importantly, there is no assertion by the defendant that the remarks were made in the course of her duties or were received by persons with a corresponding duty.","FIAT: This is an application for an order striking out the plaintiff's claim in defamation.

That being so, a reasonable causeof action is disclosed and the quoted test has not been met. 2) The statement of claim alleges malice. The plaintiffs must be afforded an opportunity to establish that. The claim lacks substance and merely serves to scandalize and annoy the defendant.

7_2010nssc146.txt,"The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence. Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.","The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging that the Crown's intention to lead newly discovered evidence compromises her s. and 11(d) Charter rights. She claimed that she had no knowledge of the contents of the prisoner package seized following the search of Thomas Izzard and of the other evidence of drugs seized from her home pursuant to a search warrant executed soon thereafter. She sought exclusion of the evidence or a mistrial. Application for return to pre-trial steps taken by the accused, including not re-electing a judge by mistake, and undertaking to give evidence in the event that charges were not dismissed on a defence motion following the close of the Crown’s case, had been prejudiced. Mistrial would allow the accused to return to a pre-judice position, while preserving her right to re-election. The accused made strategic decisions regarding the strength of disclosure received from the Crown relating to such things as her election to trial, agreements with respect to the video taped evidence and her undertaking to testify in the case that charges against her were not dismissal on a Defence motion following her first appearance on September 2nd. These strategic decisions were made to ensure that the new evidence would not affect her ability to make full answer and defence. The Crown had made these strategic decisions to ensure the accused’ s. 8 right was protected, including the right not to contest the admissibility of the video tape statement and the right to remain silent. Mistry would allow her to return back to the pre-prejudice stance, while also preserving her rights to remain quiet. The court reviewed the relevant agreements and agreements and found that the accused had made strategic choices to ensure her re-appeal to the court. The respondent had made those strategic decisions because she was afraid of losing her right and because she had not disclosed any of the new information to her counsel prior to trial. The decision was not made lightly and the court was not satisfied that the respondent had a right to refuse to reelect a judge. The Court reviewed the respondent’S decision regarding the video recording and the agreement to not contest its admissibleness and found it could not be cured by an order that was late. The trial judge was not entitled to make these strategic choices. The applicant had made them because she believed she had already lost her right. The judge was entitled to re"

While the claim discloses a possible cause of action based on the Attorney General's statutory undertakings, this alone doesn't decide the matter. The amendments add nothing by way of necessary detail to the claim, which doesn't plead sufficient material facts to comply with the Rules on pleadings (see Rule 4.02).","The defendant AGC moved for summary judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that the plaintiff's amended statement of claim did not meet the required sufficiency of claim and was not ready to defend on its own. The AGC also brought a motion for summary judgement on the premises. The defendant brought a new motion claiming that the amended statement could not comply with Rule 13.03(1)(a) and (c) of the Rules of Court. HELD: The plaintiff's statement of claims was dismissed with costs.  1) The Court found that the defendant had a cause of action arising from the statutory undertakings given by the AGC in 1996. While this was a significant factor, it did not necessarily defend against this summary judgment application based on the amended statements of claim. 2) The amendments did not add to the statement of statement of Claim. The plaintiff did not plead how the undertaking gave rise to the claim other than by attack on the making or execution of the special warrant or restraint order."
7_2013skqb67.txt,"The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","The parties have three children. They have shared parenting. The petitioner is a stay at home parent who worked casual shifts as an educational assistant. He worked part-time and sold Pampered Chef products. Following separation, the petitioner was working part- time and earned a modest income. In January 2012, the respondent began paying mortgage payments, child support and utility. He said he would no longer contribute to the mortgage payment and would reduce the child support payments. The respondent brought a motion to set monthly child support. HELD: The respondent was to pay spousal support of $500 per month, payable in installments of $1,200. The parties agreed to a four-way meeting at which the petitioner reached agreement on a number of issues. The applicant did not oppose the respondent remaining in the home on a time limited basis and indicated it should terminate June 27, 2013. There was a order granting the respondent interim exclusive possession of the family home. 1) The parties have 3 children. The Court concluded that a settlement meeting could not be a 'perfect' situation. The policy considerations which underly settlement privilege require that unless all of the issues have been resolved, privilege continues to extend to those issues where there may be a consensus unless one of the parties is required to pay child support resulting in set-off. The circumstance at hand is to be distinguished from an application to enforce a settlement agreement where it is alleged that all issues have passed. While it may be that parties in a settlement meet to reach a consensus on a variety of issues, the Court is satisfied that the policy considerations require that if all of issues have resolved, the privilege continues onto those issues. 2) The respondent is to pay Spousal Support of $350 per month. The application is to proceed in a pre-trial conference. 3) The applicant is to receive credit for monies which he has paid from September 2012 onward. 4) The petitioner shall pay spOUSAL support of a further sum of $527 per month commencing September 1, 2012 and payable on the first of each month thereafter. The amount of spousals payable by the applicant is set-up to determine spousa support payable in the event of a settlement. The Schedule A filing is to expire on September 30, 2013 and the appropriate application may be made in chambers.  5) The Court is to refer to the Spousa Support Advisory Guidelines and the specific facts of the situation at hand.

8_1990canlii4256.txt,"Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility. Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.","The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. The complainant testified that she was home every Friday night with the appellant. The Crown called a counsellor who testified that the girl had been fondled and eventually vaginal and anal, while her father was involved in an ongoing sexual assault investigation. Two medical doctors testified that all the complainant told her was that her stepfather had touched her breasts and inside her pants. The Court dismissed the appeal. The Appeal Court concluded that the verdict of the trial judge was one that a properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered. It was probable that the complainant was not sexually molested every Friday by the appellant; it was probable, however, that the appellant was involved with a girlfriend who was close to the complainant. The trial judge's decision to grant the evidence of a social worker was not so grave as to call for a quashing of the conviction."

The average income of the respondent over the past three years was approximately $180,000.

The applicant claimed special monthly expenses of $1,200 to cover nanny and child care costs, $125 for medication, $25 for recreation and $200 for a university fund. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay $1,794 per month. Section 4 of the guidelines was applicable. The significant income of the applicant is a factor to be taken into consideration. 2)The applicant did not establish that the claims for recreation and the university fund were expenses that were 'special' or 'extra-ordinary'. 3)The respondent was responsible for 2/3 of the nanny and child care costs which were justified pursuant to s7(1)(c) of the guidelines.","The only issue to be determined in this application was the amount of monthly maintenance to be paid by the respondent to the applicant as support for their child who was born in September 1986. Both parties were medical practitioners and each enjoyed significant income. HELD: 1)The only order to be made available was to pay monthly monies already paid by both parties. 2)The applicant was not satisfied that the claims for nanny and child care costs were expenses that were special or extra-ordinary. However, she was satisfied that her claim for a university fund was justified pursuant to s7(1)(c) of the Divorce Act Regulations and the claim for medication was justified. 3)The respondent was ordered to pay maintenance on an annual income of $150,000. The only expense to be calculated was the addition of extra-extraordinary expenses."
8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondents following trial on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan. The Crown argued that the trial judge erred in law by failing to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and an Aboriginal rights defence. HELD: The Crown's motion was granted. The issues were set out in the following ways: 1) The trial judge failed to consider the Aboriginal right of fish for commercial purposes; 2) The Crown failed to take into account the fact the respondents were Metis and did not establish that they were hunting for food to feed themselves or their families; 3) The Court found the accused not guilty on counts 3, 4 and 5 but for the constitutional defence which he had established. It is open to the accused to attempt to establish that their clients have an Aboriginalright to fish For Commercial purposes as well as to make out all the charges against them. 4) The defence counsel for the accused served notice of the constitutional question they intended to raise on behalf of the accused on the Attorney General. The notice identified their aboriginal right as protected under the Constitution of Canada and included references to s. 91(24) and 146 of the Constitution Act, 1867 along with the Rupert's Land and North Western Order passed pursuant a s. 146. 5) The acquittals based on the constitutional argument were apprised of the change in the Crown's position. The accused made it known to the Crown from the outset that they would also be offering a constitutional defence in which they claimed their aboriginal rights to fish were infringed by the Saskatchewan Fishing Regulations. They were doing so in a manner consistent with their Aboriginal right. The proper characterization of the aboriginal right was that the offences with which the accused were charged did not relate to commercial fishing, but applied whether the fishing was for domestic consumption or for commercial purpose. The Court concluded that commercial fishing was not an issue in this case and ordered the defence to revise their Brief in light of the issue."
8_1998canlii13830.txt,"An appeal of conviction on a charge of dangerous driving on the grounds the trial judge erred in holding that statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in the criminal proceedings; and in holding the statements could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police and therefore were voluntary and admissible. The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement. Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal. Objections to the admissiblilty of the accused's statements based upon the Charter raise a different issue and considerations from the application of common law principles and a different conclusion may have been reached.","The appellant appealed his conviction on a charge of dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in criminal proceedings. A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of certain statements made to a member of the Regina City Police Force. The voir de dire concluded that statements made made pursuant the HighwayTraffic Act could not have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. A new trial in the Provincial Court was ordered. 1)Had the Charter issues been properly raised and argued before the learned trial judge, a conclusion different from the one reached (based solely upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness) may have resulted. 2)Had there been a voir dure, a different conclusion was reached (and possibly a different approach to the evidence that counsel for either the accused or the Crown may adduce in the voir net in order to establish the Charter argument, a conviction would have resulted.)"

The applicant sought a declaration that the plaintiffs' solicitors had breached confidentiality and were in a conflict of interest and asked that they be removed as solicitors of record in this action. The applicant's husband had given her personal letters, records and documents to his solicitor in 1995. These documents were relevant to a defamation action brought by her children or their spouses. The applicant argued that a fiduciary relationship was created when the documents were accepted which was close enough to a solicitor-client retainer to give rise to a need for confidentiality and that the public's confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined if any member of that law firm acted for the plaintiffs. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs. No solicitor-client relationship was created between the husband's lawyer and the applicant when the documents were received. There was no breach of confidentiality or conflict of interest as contemplated by Chapters IV and V of the Code of Professional Conduct.

The applicant sought an order declaring that the solicitors for the plaintiffs had breached confidentiality and were in conflict of interest between clients. She asked that they be removed as solicitors of record. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs. A solicitor for the applicant had no claim to the documents and no duty was owed to her. The evidence did not support the assertion by the applicant that the plaintiffs owed a duty to her as they had their own lawyer. No solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicant and the law firm when the documents were received. No evidence was given as to why the applicant delivered the documents to the lawyer in the present litigation or in what capacity she took delivery. No explanation was provided as to what relationship the applicant might have had with the lawyer when the document was accepted.  1)No solicitor- client relationship was established between the respondent and the lawyer. Whatever documents were delivered to his lawyer in 1995 were not needed to support his legal proceedings. They were sent to Lois's lawyer. The fact that the applicant now supports his wife in her defence of the action brought by the plaintiffs does not, in my opinion, change the situation that existed in 1995. To extend the confidentiality of solicitor-custodial relationships to the circumstances of this case would, in the view, lead to unreasonable results. 2)Since no solicitor-concentration and no other duty was due to the respondent, Lois, to the petitioner, none existed relating to the law company which she is a member of.

It was not known at the time that the plaintiff made arrangements to hire an experienced subcontractor. The consultant hired to advise the defendant on the technical aspects of the project used reliable independent sources for his information about the operational viability of the planes. He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.  3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment.","The defendant Government of Saskatchewan tendered a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. Four companies submitted tenders in response to the defendant's invitation to tender. The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender. It complained the defendant had not treated it fairly in awarding the contract to Nielsen Ashdown. The defendant sued for damages. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)An implied term of fairness and the privilege clause are compatible and can co-exist. The person who invites the tenders must treat all tenderers fairly and equally, but the privilege clauses entitles him to consider all relevant factors, such as the amount of each tender, the experience and capabilities of the tenderers and the equipment to be used on the project, in determining who should get the contract. In every case, the person inviting the tendering tenders to treat all tendererers fairly must treat him fairly and must consider all applicable factors, including the amount, the amount and experience and capability of the tendererers and equipment to allow him to give his opinion. In all cases, the expert conducted his investigation in a fair and impartial manner and in accordance with common industry practice. 2)The plaintiff compensated for its lack of experience by making arrangements to bring on board an experienced sub-contractor. A fact Stanley did not know at the time he made his recommendation. The plaintiffs had compensated by making arrangement to bring back an experienced operator who had previously been the lowest tenderer on the list.

The listing agent believes that it can be sold in four to six weeks for between $124,000 and $125,000. The property is currently listed for sale at a price of between $125 and $126,000 with commission and municipal taxes to the date of sale there would be a modest surplus accruing to the registered owners."
8_2006skqb274.txt,"DIGEST The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000. HELD: 1) The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents. The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public. The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry. This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.  2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000. The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'. Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit. 3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.","The appellants were convicted by a Queen's Bench trial judge of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and the Health Of Animals Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was a fine of $69,000. The appellants appealed the sentence on the basis that the fines were too harsh and the consecutive sentences exceeded the overall capability of the offender to pay. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court of Appeal reduced the sentence to a fine and suspended the time for payment pending an enquiry. The Appeal Court found that the sentence was not demonstrably unfit and the fine was not excessive. The appeal court reduced the default times to 724 days, which was not an error of law."
8_2007skpc1.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy was a stay of proceedings. HELD: There was no waiver of the delay caused by the adjournments of the previous two trial dates. The Court found the accused suffered actual prejudice because the outstanding charge had affected her ability to apply for higher-paying job opportunities and has caused her stress and frustration. The accused did not contribute to the delay. There were some delays attributable to the accused in time until she was ready to enter pleas, and later until she appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charges set. The remaining delay is either attributable to both the Crown and the accused or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. The court found prejudice to the the accused outweighs the public interest in having her tried for the charge. The just and appropriate remedy under s24 of the Charter is a stayof proceedings."
8_2008nssc358.txt,"The corollary relief judgment provided that the parties would share parenting of their two children approximately equally. Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue. Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms.","The applicant sought to vary the child support terms of the Corollary Relief Judgment. The parties had an agreement that they would share joint custody of the children and share parenting of the two children approximately equally. The respondent asked the court to vary based on the former wife's RRSP income, which was a recurring income figure over the past four years, leaving net overpayment of $494 for the two months. The court was not prepared to retroactively vary the terms of that judgment or the terms under the Corollo Relief Judgment, as there were changes of circumstances since the granting of the last variation order. The applicant had withdrawn her RRSP Income in the four years prior to the application which was not appealed. The Corollaries Relief judgment does not apply to this application. The application is dismissed."
8_2011skca35.txt,"The applicants applied for leave to appeal from a Chambers decision denying their application to dismiss the respondent's claim against them for want of prosecution. The applicants were partners in an architecture firm that provided design drawing and specifications for the construction of the Education Building at the University of Saskatchewan. The building was substantially completed in 1970. In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building. In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss. In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief. In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer. The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997. Between 1997 and 2010, documents were exchanged, discoveries were held and an unsuccessful settlement negotiation was held. In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution. The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant. Secondly, the issue of delays in litigation is important and the case will present an opportunity for the Court to clarify the legal framework pertaining to such matters.",The applicants are defendants in an action commenced by the respondent University of Saskatchewan. They applied to have the University's claim against them dismissed for want of prosecution. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted. The applicants have been unsuccessful in this application. The court found enough merit in their position to warrant granting leave to appeal. The issue of urgency is the time between resolution of the action and the appeal. It is not in the interests of justice to strike the action for delay.
8_2011skpc3.txt,"The accused asserted that his rights to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached because the police officer did not bring a list of lawyers to the accused's attention and the accused did not have access to it. The officer may not have drawn the presence of a telephone book to the accused's attention. The officer dialed the number for Legal Aid duty counsel for the accused and the accused spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel prior to providing breath samples of 190 milligrams and 180 milligrams. The accused never indicated that he wished to contact other counsel. HELD: Following a voir dire, the accused's application to exclude evidence was dismissed. The accused had not succeeded in establishing on a balance of probabilities that the accused's right to consult counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been violated. The accused was entirely disinterested in consulting with counsel as was his right and was clear and unequivocal in his waiver of rights to counsel. Alternatively, the accused failed to indicate a desire to exercise his right to counsel.","The accused was charged with consuming alcohol in such a quantity that the blood alcohol concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The Crown entered a stay of proceedings on the other count on the Information, which alleged impaired operation of motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty of all charges.  1) The accused had not been informed of his right to choose counsel until after the conclusion of the voir dire evidence. He had not asked for more time for anything nor to be left alone to decide what to do. 2) There was no evidence of a breach of the accused's rights to counsel pursuant to s10(b) of s10. The only thing that could have been said was that the officer had not specifically asked the accused if he was satisfied and had not spoken to any lawyer. 3) The officer was in a hurry and failed to take any necessary steps to ensure that the accused had ample time to contact counsel. The accused indicated that he had not understood the meaning of'reasonable opportunity' as described in the Charter. 4) The self-incriminating evidence against the accused was excluded."
8_2013skqb397.txt,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction. The applicants were trying to use habeas corpus when they actually were seeking a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies were available only through the Federal Court.","The applicants have brought an application for writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, seeking unconditional release from the Riverbend Minimum Institution due to a threat to their respective liberties claiming the Correctional Service of Canada has violated their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in not allowing them to reside in a common housing unit so that they can participate in their long-standing, same-sex relationship outside of the public domain. HELD: 1) The applicants have been serving their 'life' or 'indeterminate' sentences at the penitentiary for the past several years. While the applicants have framed their application under the pretence of habas corpus, the true character of the remedies being sought by them is a writ of certioraris, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process. These remedy fall within exclusive jurisdiction through a review process by the Federal court. Habeas corpus is a guarantee of liberty, not a channel for drawing our Court into the day-to-day management of the pen. 2) The Court's jurisdiction to grant remedies against federal institutions and decision makers is narrow. It is not for this Court to determine the reasonableness of the administrative decisions made by the Correctional Services of Canada within the confines of its jurisdiction. Hearsay that the applicants should have followed the grievance process on the issue of housing assignments. It was obvious from the evidence the Court received concerning Sinobert's physical and mental health and the Court's observations of Sinober't during the application that he was suffering from some kind of disability. 3) The court has not established a constraint on the access and availability of materials for the Court to review the application guised as a habea corpus application."
9_1996canlii6809.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff brought an action against five defendants claiming fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a skin rash were the result of silicone implants. One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning Canada Inc. (DOW). In 1990, she received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. In 1992, she had the breast implants removed. She now suffers from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a persistent immune mediated skin rash. The Court is of the view that the connection between the silicone implants and her condition was caused by negligence attributed to the manufacturers of the breast implant. HELD: The statement of claim was dismissed. The Plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs of the application in any event of the cause. 1)Dow Chemical was at law responsible for the liabilities of Dow Corring. The defendant was found to have breached its duty to disclose the risk inherent to the breast prostheses. There was no causal connection between this failure to disclose and the plaintiff's injuries. 2)DOW Chemical was found liable for the loss of profits and general damages. There were allegations of negligence which could be presumed to have been the basis of a claim under Queen's Bench Rule 31(1)(g) and consumer products warranties Act. 3)The statement of claims did disclose wrongful conduct on the part of the defendant, the Dow Chemical Company and there was a causal connection. There could also be a causal relationship between the negligent conduct of the defendants and the plaintiffs injuries. 4)Dowell Chemical was held liable for costs of any event which occurred outside the province."
9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","The deceased's surviving spouse received a death benefit for herself and for her two children pursuant to the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The applicant also appealed a decision by Saskatchewan Government Insurance (SGI) that the death benefit was not payable to her as a surviving spouse and was based on the deceased's gross income. The respondent appealed the decision. HELD: The deceased was entitled to a pay-off pursuant to s.186(1) of the Act and the SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefits to her personally and for the two dependent children in accordance with the directions of the Court. 1)The deceased was not entitled to any other form of income that might otherwise be payable to a victim, such as deemed income for students who are unable to earn an income. 2)The death benefit is 50% of the deceased\'s actual gross yearly employment income. SGI has calculated the payment based on percentage of her late husband's net income rather than on his gross income and the ordinary meaning of this is that the payment is made to the surviving spouse on a weekly basis."
9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","The accused was charged with dangerous driving causing death. The accused was wearing a mask and was speeding when the accident occurred. He was stopped for a traffic light, but failed to lock his brakes and collided with a pedestrian. The pedestrian was killed and the accused was convicted of dangerous driving. HELD: The accused is sentenced to imprisonment in the community for 90 days. 1)The accused is prohibited from driving in the city. 2)The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that a sentence in the lower end of the range is one which should be imposed. 3)The evidence did not support the accused's guilty plea. The Court found that he should have been sentenced to more time on probation. 4)The court sentenced him to probation for two counts of dangerous operating causing death and one count of dangerous failure to maintain a motor vehicle."
9_1999canlii12597.txt,"The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action. The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act which:(a)restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the petitioner;(b)rests the respondent from releasing any monied monies that he has received in relation to the respondent's claim in Queen's Bench Action No.2270/97 pending the petitioner's application or further court order;(c)restricts the appellant from disposing of any of the monies he has already received in connection to the action;(d)restains the respondent FROM disposing any of them in relation thereto pending the application or any court order. The only requirement is that the disposition or wasting of the asset would impair or defeat the claim under the Act. HELD: The respondent's personal claim for damages in the Action is the only asset that might give him an ability to satisfy the claim pursuant to s. 45 of The Queen's B Bench Act. The ex partee order is lifted as against the AttorneyG of Canada. 1)The respondent argued that a restraining order granted under s5 of the Family Maintenance act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted. 2)The petitioner had not met the tests that must be considered in an application for an interlocutory injunction. The criteria for the granting of a preservation order are identical to those that must apply in an applications for an order for an exparte order. 3)The balance of the order was purely arbitrary and could not be raised or lowered based on the test set out in s. 10 of The Interpretation Act.  4)The order was to attach only to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent if any amount, whether by judgment or settlement, becomes payable to him pursuant to the Action. The respondent was directed to dispose of the remaining monies. 5)The application for a restraining ordered was allowed by notice of motion. The petitioner was directed not to further delay the application by the appellant until the respondent had disposed of the funds.  6)The court reviewed the wording of s. 55 of The Matrimonial Property Act and its impact on dependants. The court found that the respondent has never had assets of significant value and the Court was satisfied that the evidence establishes that the petitioner has never been in a position to reasonably conclude that if he acquired substantial funds that he would imprudently or improperly dispose of such funds or otherwise fail to use them to support"
9_2003skqb229.txt,"An appeal of conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (Criminal Code s.255 and s.253) on the grounds of misdirection in finding there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to impairment; an incorrect inference and failure to give correct legal effect to the facts as found including the lack of evidence of impairment at the material time while he was in care or control of the vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence. Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence. The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.  2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838). However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba). A properly instructed jury could have arrived at the same inference on the facts as found.","The appellant appealed his conviction of operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255 and 253 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge misdirected herself in finding that there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant's ability to operate a motor Vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The learned trial judge drew an incorrect inference from the facts at trial in finding the appellant had the care or control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The appellant's findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment by alcohol are supported by the evidence. Direct evidence confirms that the accused's condition did not change for the period that he was in the driver's seat and if impairment is indeed proven, then it applies equally to when he was first observed in the vehicle as to later observed in it. Clearly impairment of ability to drive is an issue of fact to be found on all the evidence before the Court and must satisfy the Court beyond reasonable doubt. The inference made by the trial judge is one that a properly instructed jury could have arrived at on the facts in the instant case and therefore should not be interfered with."
9_2008skqb301.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT: The parties to this action have reached an impasse on the required disclosure and seek various orders. The defendants ask that the Court exercise its discretion and sever the plaintiffs' claim between liability and damages. The defendant also seeks an order that certain paragraphs of the plaintiffs’ claim be struck. HELD: The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs. Much of the defendants’ client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants, who could be liable to the accounting firm, to the defendants in the business of the plaintiff corporation, to which the plaintiffs are entitled.  1) The plaintiffs have developed their own SR&ED application process by cultivating relationships with accounting firms, industry associations, post-secondary learning institutions and various business organizations. This venture requires secrecy. Disclosure would jeopardise the defendants ability to prove that the defendants are not breaching their contract of employment. The plaintiffs are required to disclose documents pertaining to Wolff. 2) The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that the Queen’s Bench Rules have been silent on the issue of disclosure. The Court concluded that the exemption from disclosure for certain documents relating to Wolffe’ past salary and other information relevant to the plaintiff’ s claim was unnecessary because the information would be relevant only to the claim of damages.  3) The defendants were granted their application to have the plaintiffs claim severed so that the threshold issues of liability and damage could be tried prior to requiring the defendants to disclose and be discovered on the issues of damages and production and discovery. The application was dismissed.  4) The court found no order as to costs."
9_2008skqb429.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received. There will be no costs awarded for this unsuccessful application.","The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale.

The mortgage was renewed for a year period with a maturity date of March 14, 2008. The plaintiff applied ex parte for an appointment for hearing of an application pursuant to the Act for leave to commence an action. This was not in compliance with s. 3(2) of the Act which prescribes that an application may be brought after the expiration of 30 clear days from the date of service on the Provincial Mediation Board. The affidavit of the mortgage agent was filed in support of the application. HELD: The application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for six months, and on the basis that there is no sale to be confirmed based on the evidence filed. On a renewed application for confirm of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the court any offers received. There was no order from the court authorizing pre-leave costs nor any evidence as to why the court might consider pre- leave costs. The order nisisi for sale is set aside on the grounds that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application is premature. The property is set to be list for six Months. That would require the property to be listing until December 16, 2008 and there does not appear on the affidavit to be sale to confirm. The statement of offer was not made in the terms provided by the broker for the sale."

When asked if he wished to contact a lawyer, the accused had responded in the negative, noting that there would 'probably be one down around there anyway.' statement excluded from evidence; the accused's s. 10(b) rights had been violated. It was clear that the accused was confused and not focused on the present and that his mind had wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial as opposed to his immediate right to have counsel. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty that the officer should have made an effort to clarify the informational component of the right to counsel.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and use or threatened use of weapon. The police had been aware that the accused had not been cooperative witness to them since the assault. The accused had made three statements during the course of his detention, one of which was that he wished to have legal counsel now. The Crown sought admission of the other statements made by the accused during the detention, alleging that he wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial. The defence argued that the officer had been advised of his right to counsel without delay and that he should have taken more time to make that decision. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. The court found that the trial judge's remarks regarding the degree of drunkenness, voluntariness and lack of evidence of oppression or threats did not indicate a lack of understanding of the Charter. The statement was not made voluntarily. The Court found that this was a different situation than those involving guns and narcotics. This was an absolute fundamental right to get advice from counsel before making a statement to the police. Access to counsel is the gateway of Charter rights particularly in these circumstances where this statement is the only evidence to be offered by the Crown in seeking conviction. It would be egregious to allow admission of this videotaped statement into evidence."
9_2011skpc15.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused was charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window and with aggravated assault. The major issue for the Court was whether the accused could be convicted of both the charge of mischief and aggravated assault or whether she should be convicted both of the lesser and included offences. HELD: The accused was convicted of mischief. The Court found that the accused must be convicted either of assault causing bodily harm or of aggravated assault because the Crown has not proved the requisite intent to sustain convictions under s. 267 or s. 268 of the Code.  1) In the case of R. v. Lepaskowski, [1960] S.C.R. 871, the Court held that it is still apparent that the offence is made out regardless of the consequences of the act but the consequences can be used to aggravate liability for the offence. 2) It is very apparent that by the commission of the assault that the complainant suffered bodily harm. As a result, and at a minimum, the Crown argues that the Crown hasn't proved the necessary intent to keep convictions under either s.267 or s.(266) of the code. The accused is guilty of aggravated assaulted."
9_2014skqb386.txt,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction. Corrigendum received dated March 6, 2015 and added to fulltext. HELD: 1) The trial judge erred in finding that the appellant rebutted the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) of Criminal Code that the person who occupies the driver's seat is deemed to have care and Control. He found that the accused rebutched the presumption that the ASD was malfunctioning or operated improperly, that the malfunction or improper operation resulted in the determination that the complainant's blood exceeded the approved level, and that the concentration of alcohol on the accused's blood would not in fact have exceeded that level. 2) The only thing the accused added to viva voce evidence was the addition of the emergency brake, which would have to be released prior to the vehicle moving. This did not alter the fact that his vehicle was capable of almost immediate movement and as such, created the risk the section is designed to prevent. 3) The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, stayed the proceedings."

The couple's marriage had lasted less than four years. HELD: The QB judgment was upheld regarding the severance package. The severance package was not a reward for past service; it was for payment in lieu of reasonable notice of termination. The severance package was based on future earnings, which would have occurred within the duration of the marriage.

The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules.","The plaintiff was employed by Sears as driver and driver's helper.

The implication of breaking the rules was sufficiently serious to justify termination. 2)The defendant had clearly violated the company policies concerning breaks and hours of work and overtime during the course of his employment.

The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial. The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province. He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails.

b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applied for amendment of the judgment. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be reserved on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs. It was clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now showed that substantial offers were made through counsel, although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The applicant argued that the costs of the litigation should be fixed at the date of the award, because the respondent offered settlement at a rate of 5% per annum. HELD: The judgment was awarded in lump sum. The respondent was ordered to pay the applicant post-judgment interest at a Rate of 5%. 1)The applicant had always claimed the entire estate and the debt became due and payable on the date the pronouncement was made. The Executions Act states that interest runs 'from the time of entering judgment' and not from the time that it is entered. 2)The respondent was awarded costs in a lump sum amount.  3)The Executions act states that the law is clear that a court possesses an inherent power to vary its own order so as to carry out what was intended or even to reconsider or withdraw the decision so long as the order has not been perfected. Rule 343A contemplates amendment of judgment in these circumstances. There is a substantial monetary difference between the party and party costs awarded in the judgment, and the solicitor and clients costs claimed by the applicant. However, the length of time to trial and the number of interim applications are partially attributable to the applicant who continued to make exaggerated claim for the whole of the testator's estate well past the time when it was appropriate. This contributed to the respondent's unwillingness to disclose the financial worth of the estate and prolonged the litigation and as such should be factor into the costs awarded."

She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident.

The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record. The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.  3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence. The stewards were not vested with the sole authority to determine whether there was interference at the gate. 4)Knight v. Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual. 5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions. The decision of the Commission to refuse to give the applicants notice of the hearing was patently unreasonable. Their rights were affected by the decision. Bibeault was distinguishable. 6)The applicants were awarded costs.","The applicants were the owners of two horses involved in a $15,000stakes race that comprised the sixth race on that day's card and featured a field of eight horses. The horse that won the race was disqualified for interference at the gate. The applicants applied to have the liquor and gaming licence commission investigate, consider and review any decisions or rulings of the Stewards and Judges Commission, including matters akin thereto such as fraud, bias, denial of natural justice, etc., and to have that authority override by judicial review an entirely new application. HELD: The application was allowed. The decision of the commission was quashed. The matter was remitted back to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The applicants are the owners and guardians of two of the horses involved. The parties to the application are the applicants and the applicants are entitled to the costs of their application. 2)The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record. The Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicant. The reasons for the denial were as follows: 1)the applicants were represented by an employees' association and therefore it would not be necessary for the employees to be separately represented. The decisions of the Commission were patently unreasonable. 3)The parties were entitled to make representations to the court."
b_2001canlii2619.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving causing bodily harm. Expert evidence was given based on blood samples taken after the accident that the accused was impaired; this opinion was based on two assumptions, namely, that the accused had not consumed alcohol within half an hour of the accident, nor after the accident. The Crown did not offer any evidence to prove these assumptions and, in fact, there was a three hour period prior to the accident where there was no evidence of what the accused, who did not testify, was doing. Acquitting the accused, that the expert evidence cannot be tendered by the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had been impaired. The remainder of the evidence against the accused was insufficient to prove the accused's doubt beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with criminal negligence causing death contrary to s.220 of the Criminal Code and unlawfully care or control of a motor vehicle while her ability to operate was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to ss.220 and 255(2) of the Code. The accused was acquitted of all three counts. The Court held that it was fundamental that the party introducing opinion evidence based upon hypothetical facts has the burden of establishing those facts in evidence. Impairment is an issue of fact which the trial judge must decide on the evidence. The evidence of the accused' testimony was accepted. The court found that the accused's condition was the only cause of death in the circumstances. The blood alcohol reading at the time of the accident was 47 millimoles of ethanol per litre of blood, which was within the range of background interference for the test equipment. The most salient evidence the Court adduced was the blood alcohol level at 12:10 to 12:15 p.m. on October 17th, 1999. The sample was accurately recorded as 216 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The defence objected to the admission of the opinion of the forensic expert as to the blood level of the victim at the start of the motor vehicle accident because those underlying assumptions had not been proven by the crown."
b_2003nssf19.txt,"The Agency applied for the permanent care of four young children, aged 2 to 5 years. The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met. The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them. Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional. Neither parent could, nor wished to, change in the foreseeable future.","The Agency applied for permanent care of four children. The Agency had previously been aware that the mother was neglectful and used corporal punishment as a method of disciplining them. The children had been out of their mother's care for several months and had to be placed in the temporary care of the Agency. The mother had recently lost her second child, S.M., who had been diagnosed with Head Lice. The agency had since concluded that the neglect was attributable to the mother and not the child's natural environment. The child had had several previous adverse events, including a head lice infestation. The father had since been advised by the Agency that the children were in need of protective services and that the Agency had provided some essential provisions. The three children had to remain in the permanent care Of the Agency with access to the Agency Director and the Agency worker. The permanent care application for four children was granted in respect of the first child, who was 5 years of age. The application for a parental capacity assessment was granted on the basis of the above-mentioned factors. The assessment was adjourned for a Disposition Hearing. The Court was satisfied that the expert had reviewed her medical history and had some comments to make. The evidence was that the child had been subject to some form of torture or abuse by the father and that she had been subjected to some extreme emotional trauma by her mother. The expert had advised the mother that she should increase the duration of access visits for the children and that corporal punishments would be included in the general costing clause."

The accused had previously applied to a Provincial Court judge, who had declined the accused's application. The issue was whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused's application for judicial interim release. HELD: The jurisdiction for determination of interim judicial release of a young person charged with murder under the Youth Criminal Justice Act rests solely with the superior court of criminal jurisdiction, which is the Court of Queen's Bench in Saskatchewan.",The accused was charged with murder. The hearing on his interim judicial release was held before the Provincial Court. The Provincial Court declined the accused's application for interim judicial disclosure on the grounds the accused was in the community awaiting trial. The Crown applied for a determination of preliminary issues including whether the Youth Court judge in the Provincial court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused’s application for judicial interim release; whether the Provincial Office judge had jurisdiction in the matter as provided in the Young Offender’’ Act; and whether the youth court judge in a Provincial Court had jurisdiction as a Youth Court Judge in the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The accused was granted interim judicial custody. The matter of jurisdiction under the old Young Offenders Act had been dealt with by Madam Justice Pardu in R. v. M.R. [2001] O.J. No. 2598. The issue then becomes for a young person charged with an offence set out in s. 522 of the Code. The jurisdiction for determination of interim judicial releases rests solely with the Provincial Superior Court.
b_2004skqb156.txt,"The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle. There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3) Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent SGI as provided by Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. HELD: The appellant is entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided under s. 198 of the Act. The Act provides for calculation of IRB for the first 180 days after the accident. The appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time. His employment in logging and milling business amounted to wage rate of $16 per hour for a six-week period averaging 34.25 hours. Over that six- week period, the non-earner never worked a 60-hour work week. The Court was required to make a determination whether the claimant was deprived of an employment insurance benefit in the first180 days. The income replacement benefits must reflect a claimant's earning Reality. The appellants stand for just this proposition. Section 117 and the corresponding regulations provide the mathematical formula to determine the IRB. The GYEI from which the IRBT is derived is a function of the time the employment is held. The claimant would have worked 90 days of the 180 days. HOLD: The claimant's income replacement claim must reflect his earning reality. The applicant's earning realities was working well for employment incomes no more then half the times. His earning reality is working for the same wage rate as he would have actually been employed during the 180 day period. The reduction in the period of employment be reduced to factor in inclement weather is not required. Accepting the appellant's evidence that his operation continues in incurable weather, the Court accepts that the applicant's income is not less than the amount received for the intervening day. The fact that the respondent is seeking to recover from the damage from the accident and is seeking an income replacement from SGI does not preclude the claimant from an IRB that reflects his earning realities."
b_2005nssf21.txt,"The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.",The parties shared joint custody of the three children of the marriage. The primary residence was with the mother. The parties did not seek periodic or lump sum support but rather a lump sum payment to cover tuition at the Atlantic School of Theology. The mother opposed the payment of spousal support but expressed concern that the children's best interests were served by remaining in the matrimonial home with their father. Joint custody awarded; the matrionial home was divided equally and the mother to have exclusive possession of the matron home. The court considered the circumstances of the couple's relationship since separation and found that the best interests of the children were served through remaining in their mother's company. The matrimonious circumstances included a considerable decrease in value over the past 9 months and the fact that the three youngest children had moved to Canada since the marriage ended. The father was opposed to the payment as he argued that he did not earn enough to pay such an expense and that the mother was not entitled to it. The children had access with the father every second weekend. The parents were to have joint custody with the matrons. The Matrimonial Home was clearly a matrimony asset and must be divided equally. The piano lessons and musical instruments are extraordinary expenses for extracurricular activities and are necessary and reasonable. They are included in the basic child support order. The fact that both the parents were extensively involved in the operation of the property and that they considered it a joint business operated for the benefit of the family was not a reason to deprive the father of his income.

Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along the community's highway. His driver's license was revoked and he was charged with driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his license was revved. At the time his driver's licence was revoked he was guilty of driving a vehicle on a highway while driving a motor vehicle (motor vehicle) contrary to s.287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act. The defence argued that the words'motor Vehicle' in s. 287(2)(a vehicle registered or required to be registered) do not include an ATV and even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an ATT on the road. The accused was not driving a motorcycle on the roads and his 'driver's license' was revoked. The Court found that the accused was guilty as he was driving an ATZ on the roadway and that even if the words were used to include an all terrain motor vehicle, the offence was still a motor Vehicle, as the accused could not have obtained a license to drive the ATV on the highways because it was a prohibited vehicle and it was vehicle of the wrong type or class to get license."
b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The mother applied to vary the father's maintenance for her daughters, Nicole and Kirsti. She also applied for determination that the daughters were no longer children of the marriage and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. The father in turn applied to have the Court of Appeal disincentivize the daughters from receiving maintenance in the amount of $3,644. He found that there was no agreement in 1997 to pay specified or other maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive maintenance. The trial judge found that the father had an obligation to support the daughters, but that he recognized financial dependency if not an emotional one. The Court of appeal found that this factor rarely stands alone as the sole ground for denying support unless the situation is extremely grave. HELD: The Court found that it would not be just and equitable to require the father to pay the $3 million child support in September 2006. Even if the circumstances as a whole were construed as a unilateral withdrawal by the daughters the high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.  1) The trial court found that among all the factors considered in Hickey v. Hickey, the trial judge made no palpable or overriding error in his finding that the daughter did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father. His finding that they were no now children of their marriage and therefore not entitled to maintenance in September 2007 was supported by the evidence. 2) The Court did not find any error in principle or a significant misapprehension of the evidence with respect to the issue. It was only the Court's finding that there had been a gradual but gradual change in the father’s approach to child support that was consistent with the principles set out in H.R. H. Dyson. 3) The evidence did not show that the mother unilaterally withdrew from the father, nor was it clearly wrong. The court found there was a period of time when the father was in arrears of support in the amounts of $1,644 and $3644. The issue was whether the daughters had unilaterally withdrawn from the relationship. The test in this case was whether it would be just equitable to force the father into maintenance in such circumstances. The evidence does not show she unilaterally withdrew. In light of the case law, the father did not reciprocate the mother’ s. 8 (s. 2(b)) effort by the daughter to contact him. It is clear that among the other factors considered, the conclusion"
b_2010skca58.txt,"The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident. He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial. No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.",The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.

The appellant sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed. He submitted that the information is nullity and should not be quashed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court of Appeal held that the appeal could not succeed because the appellant had not yet learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. It was not necessary for the trial judge to deal with the first three counts because the information could not be severed. The appeal must be dismissed.
b_2010skqb249.txt,"The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","HELD: The plaintiff was found to be defamed. The defendants had not only failed in their duty of care but had also breached their duty to act fairly in the grievance. The plaintiff had proven that he was defamed and accepted the defendants' defence of qualified privilege. The court accepted the defence of the defendants in the defenceof absolute privilege. 1) The plaintiff has proven that his personal and professional reputation has been seriously damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. The defendant has accepted the plaintiff's defence of preparedness and submission. 2) The court accepts the defendants defence of action of qualifiedilege. The privilege extends to all communications made by high executive officers acting in the performance of their official duties relating to matters of state. The personal and mental health of the plaintiff is inseparable from his employer's duty of caring. Jurisdiction is paramount. Juridiction is inseparably connected to the workplace. Juridity extends to any communications made during the course of Parliamentary proceedings, or any proceeding of its constituent committees by members of that body or persons appearing before it. Communications made outside the proceedings of that council, even though made by members in Parliament, are not protected by an absolute privilege such as that of a lawyer. 3) The Court accepts the defence by the defendant in the Defence of qualified Privilege."

The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner. The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal. HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it. The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it. The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.,"Civil Procedure – Custody and Access – Affidavits – AdmissibilityCivil Procedure - Affidavit – Admitting Admissible Evidence – Settlement Planning – Objection to AdmissivityCivil Procedure– Affidavitation – Admissible Evidence – Adoption – Admissions – Judgment The respondent exhibited a letter to the petitioner's counsel that was from his counsel to the respondent's counsel. It was marked 'Without Prejudice' and read 'With a Praying Eye' in it read 'with a detailed, comprehensive offer of settlement'. Although the law is clear that settlement proposals should seldom be made known to the Court, it happens too often and for no good reason. It is common sense that settlement is less likely if the parties do not engage in full and frank discussions at all if such could later be used to their detriment. A party cannot unilaterally waive privilege even on a proposal he made because it is not his to waive. Settlement negotiations are protected by settlement privilege which is a jointly held privilege that cannot be waived by any one party acting alone. Costs can be pursued with vigour after trial if either of the parties is of such mind."

The accused took no position. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. Making an order for video-conferencing for non- participating persons was not permitted because the Court had no control over the policing of the courtroom in Ontario. It would set a dangerous precedent that could result in multiple applications being made in future trials by numerous interested parties in different jurisdictions over which the Court had no control.","The applicant Government of Saskatchewan has brought a motion before myself as trial judge for an order permitting a live audio/video broadcast of the trial in Saskatoon from a Court of Queen's Bench courtroom in Sask. to a courtroom in a court house in the Greater Toronto area, Ontario.

b_2014skqb81.txt,"Limitation of Actions – Mortgage – Saskatchewan Farmland SecurityHELD: When s. 12 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act was enacted it was the legislature’s intention that a mortgagee, to whom The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act applied, could suspend the limitation period clock from running and after serving a notice of intention to enforce its security, provided that within three years of such service the mortgagee made application to the court for an order under s. 11 permitting it to commence an enforcement action. If the three years for making such an application expires without an application being made, the limitation period begins to run again. The notice of extension in this case expired in 2009 and the limitation clock began to run again. The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce the respondent’s mortgage has expired and the registration of the mortgage is ordered discharged.","The applicant asks that the registration of mortgage against land be discharged on the basis that the limitation period to enforce the mortgage has expired. The respondent says the limitation time has not expired because The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, 1988-89, c. S-17.1 provides for a suspension of limitation time running while certain proceedings are underway pursuant to that Farm Security act. HELD: The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce is suspended on the application for an order pursuant to s. 11(1) of the Farm Security legislation.  1) The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that the Limitations Act does not limit the limitation periods the respondent could use to enforce its security. 2) The application to discharge the interest register is granted pursuant to S. 12(1). 3) The notice of extension having expired on February 28, 2009 was the limitation clock began to run again. Given the limitation span has substantially expired before the service of the initial notice of intention, once the clock began running again it expired within the day. This absurd result would not flow just to the respondent in its unique circumstances. Acceptance of the respondent's interpretation of the farm security act would lead to a situation where any and all mortgagees of farm lands could entirely avoid any limitation period applying to their mortgage by the simple devise of serving notice of intentions under the Farm security Act."

The court assumed that the imputation was correct. The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them. The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","The respondent applied for an order to discontinue his obligation to pay child support and to have spousal support reduced to an amount equivalent to that of the arrears made in the original order. He relied on s. 17 of the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, and s. 14 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines.HELD: The respondent was awarded child support of $350 per month. He was in arrear in the amount of $145,000. The court accepted the original support order was correct at the time it was made but it was not sufficient to expunge the arreears. The respondent had paid little towards either the court order or his obligation, and there had been continual attempt by the Maintenance Enforcement Office to enforce the arroars. In the circumstances, the payor does have the ability to pay the arrowars. There is little doubt it will be onerous for him but then he has avoided paying anything for considerable period of time. In light of his recalcitrant approach to his support obligation, neither the passage of time nor the quantum of the unpaid arreARS should deter him from providing meaningful financial support to his children and his former spouse."
c_1992canlii2468.txt,"The appellant insurer appealed a decision dismissing its claim that the respondent conspired with her sister and brother-in-law to have her cottage intentionally burned. The appellant asserted the respondent acted fraudulently by failing to make full disclosure of the facts surrounding the cause of loss. Dismissing the appeal, that the respondent did not wilfully make any false statement, and answered all questions as required on the documents provided. Her silence in the face of uncertainty over her in-laws involvement in the fire did not constitute fraud. If the appellant expects an insured to comply with statutory conditions, it must reproduce them in the policy and provide a question on the proof of loss form to that effect.","The appellant claimed payment of $20,000 plus expenses associated with investigating and adjusting the loss. The trial judge found that the appellant did not know whether or not her brother-in-law had arranged the fire and therefore did not constitute fraud or wilful fraud. The appellant contended the trial judge erred in finding that the respondent did not commit fraud and that coverage under the insurance policy was vitiated pursuant to Statutory Condition 7. The respondent did, however, make a false statement to the trial court as she did not disclose the conversations with her sister. The appeal was dismissed with costs of $1,200.00. The appellants appealed the trial decision. Dismissing the appeal, that the statutory condition 7 applies where every insured has a duty to act in good faith regardless of whether or Not they believe the accused. The failure of the respondent to advise her husband of the possibility that the Nicholsons arranged the match did not amount to fraud or a wilful false statement. The policy contained no provisions which required the insured's to state how the fire originated so far as the insured knew or believed. The statement made by the appellant's adjuster was contrary to the statement made in the insurance policies and was found to be inconsistent with the evidence."
c_1992canlii4682.txt,"This was an application for an Order in the nature of Habeas Corpus and Certiorari in aid. The applicant had been charged with the first degree murder of her estranged husband. The judge at preliminary inquiry concluded that there was evidence adduced that the accused had paid money to the man who had killed the victim the day after the killing, that she was involved in cleaning the apartment where the killing took place after the body was removed, and that the accused and the man who killed the victim had discussed the matter prior to the event, and thus there was sufficient evidence upon which a 'properly instructed jury may find...[the accused] guilty...' The appellant contended that the judge had applied the wrong test for committal. Dismissing the application, that the question is not whether the judge correctly verbalized the test, but rather if the evidence supported the committal, and there was, indeed, enough circumstantial evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed and acting reasonably in accordance with those instructions, could convict the accused of first degree murder.","This was an application by the applicant for an order in the nature of Habeas Corpus and an order for certiorari in aid. Dismissing the application, that there was evidence before the trial judge upon which a jury, properly instructed and acting judicially could convict the accused of first degree murder. The evidence before this trial was conclusive that the accused had indeed committed the offence for the purpose of causing death. The court applied the broader test as articulated in R. v. Lapierre. The trial judge did not err in law in committing the applicant to trial nor did he state that he had direct evidence of planning on the part of the applicant."

The applicant, which leased six school buildings from the Roman Catholic Church, submitted the respondent was required to reimburse the applicant for leasing costs. For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs.

It is the Province bears the responsibility for the negotiations and payment of rental costs associated with the leases. The issue is whether the Minister of Education is required to reimburse the CapeBreton Board for the costs incurred by the Board in leasing these school buildings from the Church. The Cape Bretons have never been required to pay the rent of the buildings from outside the Church and, because of the failure to follow the Education Act, the Province is not required to provide buildings for the service of the public school program."

Child support guidelines suggest an annual obligation of $960 for the father at the level of income. This payment will leave him with $1010 per month after he has paid his income tax, Canada Pension Plan and Unemployment Insurance contributions.

c_1996canlii472.txt,"The plaintiff held a mortgage on a house destroyed by a suspicious fire. At the time of the fire there were two insurance policies in place for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff. One was placed by the mortgagors with the defendant to protect both their interests and those of the plaintiff. When the defendant notified the plaintiff that it was going to cancel the policy, the plaintiff placed a second policy on the property. The fire occurred less than a day before the first policy was to be cancelled. The defendant refused to honour the policy. It claimed that the formal Proof of Loss filed by the plaintiff was fraudulent, as it failed to disclose the existence of the second policy. Finding for the plaintiff, that the defendant has not satisfied the heavy burden of producing clear and satisfactory evidence that the plaintiff, through its employees, acted wilfully and knowingly to claim the benefit of coverage to which it was not entitled.","The plaintiff insurer, which represented the defendant defendant, failed to disclose the existence of a second insurance policy under which the plaintiff obtained a cancellation notice of cancellation. The defendant insurer, Marsh, had previously placed a policy on the plaintiff which protected her interests and the interests of the mortgagee. The plaintiff commenced foreclosure proceedings against the defendant insurer after the fire. The defendants were in receipt of the notice of cancelation when the fire occurred. The property was vacant and had been totally destroyed by fire. When the fire happened, the defendant insurance company, which had placed the policy on her premises, notified the plaintiff insurer of the impending foreclosure action. The insured suffered loss of $100,000. The mortgagee was in arrears at the time of the fire and had received notice that the policy was cancelled. The insurance company did not pay any of the $100k. The defence argued that the failure of the defendant to disclose this policy to the plaintiff's insurer raised the bar to a certain level of moral and ethical conduct. Dismissing the application, that the standard of proof in this case was on the balance of probabilities but on a higher degree of probability, commensurate with the conduct alleged. The court found that the defendant breached its contractual obligation to insure the plaintiff against creditors. As a result of the foreclosure action, the insurer was forced to foreclose on the property. The Court also considered the individual circumstances of the plaintiff and found that since the policy had been placed with the plaintiff, she was not adversely affected by any misrepresentation on the part of the insurer."

Although a statement of claim was served on the defendant, it's insurer was advised by the plaintiff's counsel that she would not proceed to judgment except on 10 days written notice. More than six months later plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to the defendant's insurer giving 10 days notice. This letter was not seen by him although he was in the process of putting together material for a solicitor to file a defence. The defendant had always advised the plaintiff that it intended to defend. No Notice of Intention, required for default judgment if six or more months had elapsed since the last step in the proceeding, was ever given to the defendant before the filing of the default judgment. Allowing the application and setting aside the default judgment, that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse on the part of the defendant for not filing the defence. Sending a letter to the insurer does not satisfy the requirement of filing a Notice of Intention to proceed. The fact that the prothonotary did not object to the request for default judgment without the Notice is immaterial.","This was an application for an order setting aside a default judgment entered against the defendant municipality in February 1996. The plaintiff had filed an affidavit claiming that a mudslide had occurred during the construction of a sewage treatment lagoon. The defendant had hired the plaintiff's insurance agent to do the work and had entered into a contract with the plaintiff to do Phase 3 of the sewage treatment project. When the project was completed, a mud slide occurred causing extensive damage to the plaintiff property. She sought and was awarded her 'throw away' costs of obtaining the default judgment. The applicant applied for a default order set aside, arguing that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse for not filing the defence. Application granted; the defendant had not broken the default order, there was no breach of the plaintiff s s.2(d) of the Act, no negligent conduct or breach of contract did not constitute a fairly or arguable ground of interest and the failure to file notice of intention to proceed was not a serious issue."
c_1996canlii5615.txt,"The appellant appealed his sentence of five months in prison to be followed by 18 months probation following his plea of guilty to the theft of his grandmother's car. Crown counsel acknowledged that this type of case would generally attract a suspended sentence with probation but for negative information in the pre-sentence report, which the appellant had not seen prior to sentencing. The appellant argued that he had seen the errors of his ways, was seeking employment, was truly remorseful, and had apologized to his grandparents, who were paying for the appeal in the hope of keeping him out of jail. The appellant was allowed to file affidavits as to the his progress concerning his problems with drugs and alcohol.

Per Bateman, J.A., dissenting, that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were lacking in probative value. It is left, then, to determine the fitness of the sentence at the time it was made. Taking into account the factors before the sentencing judge, the sentence imposed could not be found to be clearly unreasonable.","The appellant, who had been convicted of theft, applied for leave to appeal. Appeal allowed; sentence to be set aside; probation to be imposed for the offence of theft of property exceeding $5,000. The appellant's father was given leave to file affidavit evidence. The affidavit evidence was inadequate.

c_1997canlii1639.txt,"This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff went on maternity leave for six months. During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff. The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended. She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause. She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice. Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice, that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice. This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause.","This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff claimed that she was constructively dismissed without notice by her employer, the defendant. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to militage during her employment with the company. The plaintiffs employment agreement provided for a period of employment of 'up to 25 hours per week', with an annual rate of pay of 6% or 6% per year. The agreement stipulated that the plaintiffs employment should be fixed at full time, with an eight month period for any period of time which would have been appropriate. The contract stipulated the plaintiff should have at least six months notice of any change in her employment schedule. She was awarded damages in the amount of $12,000.00. This was an appropriate period of notice. The court found that the employer should have taken into account the ten months maternity leave the plaintiff took while in the employ of the defendant in the reduction of the period of the employment. The fact that the employee was not working part-time at the time of the agreement made this an appropriate time for notice."
c_1998canlii13762.txt,"The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s27 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell them the lands which were subject to their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation. The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution. The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal. There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they have complied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which are the subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant resisted the requested relief on the basis the plaintiffs had not validly exercised their right to first refusal. Specifically that they did not meet the requirements set out in s. 26(2)(b) of The Farm Land Security Act. In issue was the solicitation of a letter of commitment from a recognized financial institution to finance the purchase of the land. HELD: The plaintiffs were entitled to a declaration they had complied with requirements pursuant to s. 28 of the Act and that an order that the defendant forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs by the plaintiffs on the usualtrust conditions and counterclaims were dismissed. 1) The defendant counterclaimed against the plaintiffs for rent it claims owing from the plaintiffs asover holding tenants. 2) The amount of mortgage financing available was reduced to $629,280 owing from $629.5 million owing from March 1997 to April 1998. The mortgage financing was always subject to terms which for the most part were routine and well understood. The terms of the financing agreement were not conditional or equivocal. Neither the mortgage financing agreement nor the letter of pledge required by the Act was conditional or unequivocal. The legislation was not complied with.  3) The plaintiff had committed themselves to the Farm Credit Corporation, who as it turned out was not prepared to provide such a letter, and they also incurred liabilities with the Farm credit Corporation for loan processing fees and solicitor costs. 4) The Court found that the plaintiff had not exercised its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation by offering a different requirement for the exercise of the right of refusal in its offer enclosed with the cover letter dated March 24, 1997. In the offer form, it did not require that it be a forwarded letter of a commitment directly from the financial institution, and simply required that the plaintiffs 'provide a such letter' such a request."

The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm. At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes. She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses. 2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case. There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur. There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening. Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her. The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet. The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter. The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs.","The Law Society of Saskatchewan applied to the Court to determine whether the law firm in question was in a position of conflict of interest with respect to the matrimonial files. The applicant lawyer had worked with the law office of a client since 1998 and had not had any contact with that client since her employment at the law school. The evidence showed that all the screening measures, with the exception of the computer file segregation, occurred prior to the applicant's arrival and included an implicit warning of sanctions in the event the policy was not adhered to. The application was dismissed. The court found that the applicant had not received confidential information from her clients during the time she was with the firm and that there was no risk that it would be used to the prejudice of the client. There was also no risk to the respondent's assistant because she had not disclosed this information to her colleagues. The screening measures were necessary to ensure that no disclosure would occur and the applicant could continue to represent her client.

The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial. The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access.

The judge made no error in ruling that all of the evidence from the prospective witnesses and transcripts was irrelevant as being unrelated to the charges and too remote in time. The appellant's state of mind was adequately established by his own evidence and the summation to the jury. The defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it.

c_2002skca74.txt,"The appellant was unsuccessful in Queen's Bench in having his suspension and probation as a medical resident rescinded or to prohibit the Investigation Committee, which met on approximately seven occasions and interviewed seven witnesses, from taking further action. The Chambers judge refused to grant relief, finding the issues to be academic in nature and within the exclusive jurisdiction of the University, but ruled his supervisor should be removed from the Committee because of an apprehension of bias. The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure. He argued all committee members, except the union representative, should be excluded by reason of bias. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. 1)The material did not meet the test for the admission of fresh evidence. It simply restated what was at issue and found to have had no effect. 2)There was no tenable basis for interfering. The remedies are discretionary. 3)The Court was not prepared to grant the relief in any event, given the long delay in seeking recourse. The initial concern was bias and jurisdiction. The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below. 4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations. Proceedings should not be allowed to be fragmented and should be allowed to run their course so the court has a complete record from the tribunals below. Certiorari should not be granted where there is a right of appeal, except in exceptional circumstances.","The medical resident appealed his suspension and probation as a medical resident and to prohibit the Investigation Committee established to look into the matter from taking further action.

The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm. The petitioner's claim for $1,000, borrowed from a friend to pay legal fees, was not considered a matrimonial debt.","The petitioner sought a distribution of family property pursuant to the Family Property Act. The parties lived on an acreage and rented farm land. They carried on a mixed farming operation. The respondent did the farm work with the petitioner providing assistance. In 1996, the respondent purchased a tractor from his uncle and sold it to the petitioner for $2,200. The petitioner had no income from the farm since the separation. HELD: 1) The farm machinery was divided equally. The value of the cows was $1,350. The farm equipment was $856.00 and the value of farm machinery at $2200. 2) The respondent sold his trailer and the proceeds were used to purchase the farm machinery. 3) The petitioner received no income since the marriage. She should bear no responsibility for the payments made and the Court declined to take them into account. 4) The Court weighed the oral testimony of several witnesses, including the petitioner. The father stated he had no interest in any equipment owned by the respondent. He claimed that 1990 Ford F-150 truck was exempt. The Court accepted the father's testimony that he owned the tractor prior to the marriage and that it was subject to the tax exemption. 5) The amount of the machinery to be distributed was $51,725.82 together with taxable costs of the action. The amount given by the petitioner to the respondent was $33,257.31. 6) The machinery was subject only to the taxation costs of this action. 7) The father owned a tractor which was acquired prior to marriage. The appellant shall have three months to pay the amount of judgment. The amounts set out do indicate that the respondent never paid the $16,500. The court did not take into account interest earned from the tractor. 8) The appellant's interest earned would not be exempt. 9) The court weighed the testimony of numerous witnesses, both including the father. The judge found that the appellant's father owned the farm equipment and machinery which were on-going expenses and related to the farm. The appellants had no claim to the equipment at the time of purchase. 10) The appellant had a debt of $1 million which he claimed to be owed to the father in respect to the Versatile 160 tractor.

c_2002skqb508.txt,"A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","The Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of certain food services at the University of Saskatchewan. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties had failed. The employer had advised the Board that it was not prepared to make the agreement retroactive. HELD: The motion was dismissed. The Board did not meet the standard of patently unreasonable conduct and error. While there is a magic formula in how long it may take parties to forge an agreement through collective bargaining, ratify and actually sign a agreement, there is no magic in the date that an application to the Board will be heard and decision issued. It is dependent on a number of contingencies including general application of first in first in the first place rule to the hearing of applications, availability of the parties, their counsel and of panel members, previous commitments, and intervening priorities. It would be unsound to base entitlement to retroactive benefits on the serendipitous signing of a collective agreement or the signing of Board decision imposing one."
c_2003skqb58.txt,"Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act. The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision. The Crown did not seek costs.","The plaintiffs applied for certification under The Class Actions Act on behalf of the following classes: Veterans Resident Class Any Indian who served in the military, Civil or Military, or was displaced from their position by the enactment of the Canada Pension Plan Act in 1985. The plaintiffs claimed entitlement to 'Survivors' Pensions' pursuant to legislation enacted July 31, 2000. The statement of claim was issued in 1993. In both tort and contract, the limitation period in Ontario is 6 years. The Crown also alleges that the plaintiffs are statute-barred from receiving the Survivors' Pension that they seek. HELD: The action was dismissed as statute- barred. 1) The Court found that only if the class members succeed in this litigation and reach the bureaucratic stage of applying for the ex gratia payment will the question of individual issues arise. 2) There are a number of limitations issues, some of which are common and others that will be individual to the class member. The Court should be reluctant to deny a class member his or her day in court. 3) There is no suggestion Indian War Veterans were denied the right to apply for veteran's benefits. The issue at the certification stage is not whether the claim is likely to succeed but whether the suit is appropriately prosecuted as a class action. 4) There were number of issues, most of which were common and some of them were individual to class members."
c_2004skca153.txt,"The respondent was convicted after trial of fraud exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge granted him a conditional discharge with a probation order of 1 year and a requirement of 200 hours of community service work. He also made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The learned judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1) of the Code. The sentence imposed did not properly reflect the principle of deterrence or the gravity of the offence. 2) This was a serious fraud accomplished by what the judge called a rather intricate kiting system.","The accused was convicted, after trial, of fraud exceeding five thousand dollars. He was 28 years old and had two young children. He deposited a cheque for $11,000 on his personal bank account knowing that the account lacked sufficient funds. He withdrew the money five days later, depositing and withdrawing $13,000 in cash. He then returned the money 5 days later and withdrew $13k more than five days before depositing the last $13000 in a bank account. This was a serious fraud accomplished by virtue of what the Provincial Court judge called a rather intricate kiting system. The accused had no criminal record and pre-sentence report suggested he was low risk to re-offend. He had no previous involvement with the system. He agreed that the conditional discharge would do little to discourage others from undertaking similar sorts of criminal activity. The Court allowed the appeal."
c_2005skqb166.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused. As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). The trial judge applied the test that showed he was more than twice the legal limit, but the breath demand was stronger than the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. The entry of a judicial stay on the.08 charge was not used to avoid a multiple conviction issue. Volume of consumption falls within the provisions of s.253. The trial court relied on the readings contained in the Certificate of Analysis; reliance by the trial judge on the reading of the breathalyzer readings; and consideration by the Trial Judge of evidence arising subsequent to the breath request. The only error in law was that the certificate readings showed he is more than half the legal maximum; therefore, the conviction could have resulted in a new trial."
c_2005skqb450.txt,"The petitioner seeks an order for ongoing child support based on the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The respondent seeks an order that his child support obligations for their child ended July 2004 because their child ceased to be a person within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act as he was not, by reason of the pursuit of reasonable education, unable to withdraw from his mother's charge. HELD: 1) The child completed grade 12 in 2004 having turned 18 in February. He returned to high school in the fall of 2004. He worked at McDonald's during that year and lived with his mother. Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media. He is still under his mother's charge. She provides him with room and board. He is only 19 years old. He has been pursuing his education. The fact that he changed his course of study does not disentitle him to consideration for support. He is a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Act. This will continue until March 2006 when he has completed his current course of study. 2) The respondent's income fluctuates. It is appropriate to take an average of the last 3 years to determine his income.  3) Some attention must be paid to the financial ability of each parent to contribute. After deducting the table amount, the respondent would have a gross annual income of $19,781.52. On that basis the court was not prepared, even in the face of some shortfall for the child, to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts. The guideline amount is the appropriate amount to be paid until the end of this year's study.","The Court dismissed the application. It found that the respondent was a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Family Maintenance Act, 1997 and that he had had that status on a continuing basis to the present time. The respondent had made an application for ongoing child maintenance based on the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The petitioner had lost her sight in 2001 and had been continuously employed part-time for the past 3 years. He had changed employment in order to contribute to his own support and had ceased to be a person in the meaning in the Act as he was not, by reason of the pursuit of reasonable education, unable to withdraw from the mother's charge or to obtain the necessaries of life. The Court ordered the respondent to pay $181 per month for child maintenance. The reasonableness of the choice and the means and needs of the child and parent is discussed."

Application for summary judgment granted. The evidence showed that only an offer to lease had been made, with no lease agreement ever having actually been signed, and that the individual with whom the landlord had dealt was only intended to be a guarantor and never a tenant.","The Trustee in Bankruptcy received a voluntary assignment for bankruptcy by the Superintendent of Bankruptcies. The Trustee was appointed as Trustee In bankruptcy. The former retained the former as a contractual agent to value and liquidate the premises. The latter was unable to gain possession of the premises and the Trustee applied for an interim injunction. The applicant obtained a consent order directing that the former be the sole guarantor of the property and that the applicant receive reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements directly associated with the removal and relocation of the assets.

c_2011nssc20.txt,"The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson. They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","The defendant moved for summary judgment on evidence, claiming damages for the injuries suffered by two of the plaintiffs. Both were paid damages for their injuries. Both signed releases acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident. The plaintiff now claimed damages for damages for injuries sustained as a result of the accident which they allege was caused by the careless and negligent actions of the defendant in the design and manufacture of the vehicle. The defendant motion for summary judgement was granted and the claims of both Steven and Jody Johansson were dismissed. The parties were encouraged to try to reach an agreement on costs."
c_2013skpc37.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08. The accused was permitted to use his cell phone on the way to the RCMP detachment to call his wife in Calgary and request help in finding a lawyer. He did not receive a call back from his wife. The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available. The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid. After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.' The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value. The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call. The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape. The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio. The video was taped over every 60 days and had been destroyed before it was requested by defence counsel. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. Even though the accused's cell phone was taken from him before he received a call back from his wife, it is clear that the accused made a conscious decision to call Legal Aid, and by implication, did not wish to pursue the first course of action. There was no obligation on the part of the RCMP to provide the accused with a Prosper warning. The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult with another lawyer. The officer was justified in assuming that the accused was satisfied with the legal advice he had received. The Crown stayed the impaired driving count prior to the conclusion of the trial. The videotape evidence was not relevant to the .08 offence because all observations were made at roadside. The video would not have shown anything of relevance to the charge. There is no breach of the accused's rights under s. 7. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted into evidence and the accused was convicted of the .08 charge.","The accused was charged with driving over.08 contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; and driving while over.breath at the roadside while over..08, while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol contrary to ss. 253 and 253(2)(a). The accused blew a screening device and was taken to the detachment where samples were obtained. The accused was breath tested at 1:21 a.m. and 1:41 a.M. The officer who stopped the accused and found him to be in good health took the opportunity to ask the accused if he was satisfied and he said'sure'.

In this situation there was no obligation on the police officer to provide the accused with a warning. 2)The destruction of video evidence did not breach the accused's rights under s10(b).  3)The evidence was destroyed. There was no breach of the accuseds right to counsel. The absence of any evidence of the call to Legal Aid was a minor inconvenience. 4)The Court could not have found any evidence that the accused breached his rights under ss.10(a) and s.10b. An independent assessment of the evidence would have been inconclusive. 5)The absence of a warning was not sufficient to prevent the accused from making full answer and defence.  6)The officer was justified in assuming he was under the influence of alcohol. 7)The observations in the hallway and breathalyzer room were recorded on VHS. The cameras are placed in the top corner of each room and according to the officer it would not be possible to pick out the features of individuals.

c_2016skqb269.txt,"HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","The accused was charged with failing to ensure the health and safety of the employee by failing to instruct him on how to unplug a small pit in a grain terminal. The employee suffocated after stepping onto the grain in a receiving pit. The accused had not yet received hands-on training on how the safety procedure was implemented. The evidence showed that the employee had been adequately instructed, trained, supervised and informed he would not have entered the receiving pit without following the safety procedures. HELD: The accused was found guilty of failing to supervise and supervise the employee. The Court of Appeal did not accept the Crown's position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proves the actus reus of failing not to ensure employee health and well-being. The court found that the evidence of the person who said the words 'to look into the receiving Pit' was not reliable. The fact that the witness said the incident occurred when the employee was still in his truck and not in the pit did not necessarily mean that the employer failed to provide proper training and supervision to ensure that the worker was made aware of the hazard. The matter was also reviewed for reliability and accuracy. The majority of the witnesses testified that they were not aware of what the officer said to them. The mass of material emphasized the dangers, and the importance of following the Safety procedures, rather than burying them."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","The accused was convicted of dangerous driving, dangerous driving and assault. The accused appealed his conviction on dangerous driving. The defence argued that the trial judge failed to take into account the fact that the accused was driving slowly and in a manner that created a danger to the complainant and her young daughter. The offence was committed between spouses where minor incidental physical contact can be expected and where minor motor vehicle activity is nothing more than de minimis non curat lex and is not worthy of criminal sanction. The trial judge also found that the appellant intentionally drove in a way which created a dangerous danger for others, and drove in such a manner as to scare the complainant. The Court also questioned the trial court judge's decision in favour of the accused on dangerous drive. The appellant argued that she should have been more alert and aware of the danger to herself and her daughter. Appeal dismissed; the trial trial judge's conclusion was that the offence was between spouses and was a marked departure from the conduct expected of a reasonably prudent driver. The fact that both parties were travelling in residential neighbourhoods was a matter of concern. The evidence showed that the complainant was not in her vehicle to avoid a collision. The location of where the incident occurred elevates the dangerous nature of the appellant's actions; the fact he drove parallel to the woman and pushed her towards the side of the road is testament to the dangerousness of the manner of driving."
d_1991canlii4237.txt,"In this divorce action the petitioner sought to have a separation agreement entered into by the parties incorporated into the corollary relief judgment. The respondent sought to have the separation agreement set aside on the grounds of duress, undue influence or unconscionsability. The couple had a traditional marriage. The petitioner earned $48,000 per year. The wife did not work outside the home and suffered from severe arthritis. For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","The parties entered into a separation agreement for the purpose of increasing the maintenance provision and retaining the asset division. The husband argued that the agreement should be set aside as a whole, in part under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, because it was unconscionable, unduly harsh or fraudulent and had an extremely fair and indeed an unequal division in her favor. Matrimony Home The parties in their separation agreement indicated that they assumed $60,000 of matrimonial assets at the time of separation. The wife argued that it was entered into under duress or undue influence of her husband or alternatively that the maintenance award was of such a low amount that it is unconscible to bind her to such a level. Matrionial Property Law – Matrimonial Property – Divorce Act, Nova Scotia – Matriarchy – Property – Retirement Home The Matrimonian Property Act is a separate Act and the Matriol Property Act was not recognized. The Matriole Property Act does not recognize marriage contracts and separation agreements. The matrimony home was valued at $60 million at the present time and the value of the matrimonium was $400 million at that time. Matrononial Property – Matron of Rights – Matrilonial Property The matrionial home was divided equally between the husband and wife. Matronships were awarded in matrimonies. Matrilature Matrimonies were awarded at matrimonal times. Matrices were valued at different times. The value of matriolature was high. Mathematicians were awarded significant sums. Mathematically, the matriole home was in the amount of $60.5 million at present. Mathematical matrimonia was a separate action. The court reviewed the matrices and determined that the matrilonial home in question was $60 and the wife's claim was unconsciable, unfair or fraudulent. The maintenance award of $1,200 was unconsculable and it is in the best interests of the child to have it set aside. Matriconial property laws do not confer or transfer jurisdiction one from another. The asset division achieved by the wife under the separation agreement is far from being unconscribable, unjustuly harsh, or fraudulent in that it achieves an extremely unfair and indeed unequal division of matrilature assets in her favour. If the court were to set aside the separation, it would find that there are no factors that have been established under s13 of the Act to warrant other than an equal division"

The applicant was given written notice of the substance of both allegations according to the disciplinary procedure set out in the regulations made pursuant to the Police Act, but in the space provided for the citation the notice cited only the regulation which dealt with the offense of being discourteous. A hearing before an inspector of the Police Department resulted in the applicant being found guilty of the offense of lying. She initiated a review by the Police Review Board which concluded that the section reference in the charge did not have to be accurate. The applicant brought this proceeding for judicial review and submitted that the Board's jurisdiction was limited by the citation of a particular regulation and to finding her guilty of the behaviour described in the regulation cited. Dismissing the application, that the failure to cite what the Board considered the proper offense in no way materially affected the procedural fairness of the hearings or limited the Board's jurisdiction. The applicant had complete notice of the nature of the allegations against her and was represented by counsel at the Board hearing. Certiorari will not issue for mere technical or trivial oversights and there was nothing patently unreasonable about the decision such as would warrant judicial intervention.

It was clear from the evidence that the complainant knew the nature of the allegations being made against her and that the respondent was fully entitled to do so.

The appellant appealed his conviction on three grounds: 1) the trial judge failed to permit the testimony of a school teacher, who had been falsely accused of making sexual comments to the complainant by the complainant; 2) the learned trial judge erred in law in refusing to permit cross- examination of the complainant on an audio/video cassette; 3) on an earlier contradictory statement on audio/cassette, without even having heard the contradictory statement; and 4) the appellant had strong economic and family ties to his community. All of these grounds were raised at trial by the appellant. He had pled guilty on the first count."

The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had. HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed. 1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted. He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest. The plaintiff was entitled to interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act on the claim for extras to the contract. 4)The claim for the extras was never in dispute. The defendants were entitled to costs of the action.,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant whereby the plaintiff was to build and supply a ready to move home (RTM) placed on basement. The plaintiff alleged that the contract price stipulated in the agreement was in error and commenced a rectification process. The defendant sought to recover the amount of the contract which was in breach. The action was dismissed. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for interest was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant knew the plaintiff did not supply a basement and therefore there was no agreement to pay interest. 2)The plaintiff was not awarded judgment for rectification. 3)The evidence was not clear and unambiguous and established by convincing evidence. The evidence was also not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% wasinserted into the document. 4)The Court cannot accept the plaintiff's version of events. The fact is that after a number of discussions about the specifications they wanted in their home, they asked for a price on an RTM and basement. There was no clear and convincing evidence that an interest rates of 15 % was included in the contract. An interest rate that high as 15% is not included in a standard agreement.

Adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' did not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law. The wording on the second issue was changed slightly to read 'in his calculation as to damages awarded for increased costs of winter construction'. There was some evidence upon which the arbitrator could make a finding of fact. 2)As none of the bars set out in the Act applied the court was required by s50(3) to give judgment enforcing the award.  3)The application for costs on a solicitor and client basis was denied. Failing agreement between the parties, the appellant would pay the respondent's taxed costs on the appeal on a party and party basis.","Paterson Sons appealed an arbitration award respecting a contract dispute between it and Rail Contractors. The contract provided that either party can refer any dispute respecting their contractual obligations to arbitration. The dispute arose between the parties respecting the performance of the contract and both parties agreed to a resolution by arbitration. They each retained legal counsel, retained an arbitrator, agreed on an arbitrators arbitrator and defined the issues to be resolved. The arbitrator's award was favourable in most respects to the position taken by the respondent. The issue was whether the arbitrator made the correct decision on the evidence presented. Paterson Sons applied to have the award set aside on the basis of the fact that, on an appeal from an arbitration decision, unreasonable findings of facts that constitute palpable and overriding errors can be set aside. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed. 1)The first ground of appeal was whether there was any evidence to support the finding of facts. There was no provision in the arbitration terms of theContract to Change Act to allow the appeal court to delve into the evidence to attempt to determine whether or not the arbitrators findings of fact are supported by the evidence or are 'contradicted' by theEvidence. 2)The second ground of the appeal was different in wording and scope. The appeal court could not delve into that evidence to determine if or not whether the arbitration award was supported by evidence or were 'contrary' by evidence. 3)The findings of the arbitration award with which the appellant takes issue were not questions of law but rather questions of fact. The appellant's submission refers extensively to the evidence presenting to the arbitrating arbitrator. It constitutes an invitation to the court to retry the case that was heard and determined by the arbitrated arbitrator as it was premature in the circumstances and in any event would have been required."
d_1997canlii11439.txt,"The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The deceased made a will and codicil in November 1989 and December 11, 1989 respectively. Neither made any provision for the younger child. The will was subject to sale in the Executor's absolute discretion with the like discretion to apply the net income and to encroach on capital for the maintenance of the child until he reached the age of twenty-one years. The petitioner sought an order under The Dependents' Relief Act varying child maintenance from $150 per child to $1,245 per month for the two children. The executors did not oppose the application under the Widents' relief Act however they did put in place an order which would have the effect of reducing the estate's ability to support the children. HELD: The child was to be allocated equally with the other child. 1)The term 'personal effects' does not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the business oroperations of the farm. 2)The children were to receive their share of the estate upon attaining the age twenty-five years.  3)The terms of the Will were not to be given as a whole other than its ordinary meaning with the clarification that the Testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles.  4)The estate was divided equally between the two sons. The term 'poverty' doesNot include grain or livestock, livestock or other immovable assets related the business, performance or benefit of the farming operation. 5)The father was to keep the farm land and livestock. 6)The mother was to retain the farm machinery and livestock for the children until they reached the ages of twenty years. 7)The executors were to keep all the farm equipment, livestock and other assets which related to their business or theiroperations. 8)The prescribed amount of maintenance was reduced from $3,000 per month to $2,500 per month as the estate was in need of liquidation."

The mother moved with the daughter to British Columbia in 1997. The parties did not agree upon ongoing access. HELD: The father's generous and far reaching requests were not reasonable at this time given his lengthy non-contact. It was important that he be reintroduced to his 10 year old daughter in a gradual and consistent fashion. He was granted access intitially for three and four hours in both provinces, then two days at the father's parent's home including overnight access and two days in the summer in British Columbia. Weekly telephone access was to continue each Sunday evening. Access was to be reviewed in the fall of 1998.","FIAT. The 10 year old was born in a custody and maintenance agreement with the parents. The father argued that he should be granted access every second weekend, every second Christmas and Easter and two weeks in the summer all unsupervised.

The length of his non-contact with the daughter was lengthy and it was important that he be reintroduced to his daughter in a gradual and consistent fashion."
d_1999canlii12779.txt,"The bankrupt was self-employed and failed to pay his taxes, owing Revenue Canada $89,000. The trustee calculated surplus income at $435 per month and recommended a conditional order of discharge requiring the payment of $7,800. Revenue Canada objected, requesting a conditional order for monthly payments of $750 over 4 years. HELD: Conditional order of discharge granted. The court found that the bankrupt was 43 years old, in good health and with no dependents. The bankrupt was also a self-employed contractor with an 'enviable' income. Following a review of the bankrupt's financial material on file, the court ordered the bankrupt to pay $500 per month for 3 years, to make regular installment payments on his self-employment income and comply with tax filing requirements.","The sole unsecured creditor was Revenue Canada with a proved claim of $89,000 for unpaid income tax and unremitted G.S.T. The bankrupt had been self employed and had no dependants. He requested a payment of $500 per month for three years without jeopardizing his ability to pay toward his tax obligations. HELD: A conditional order was ordered requiring the bankrupt to pay $18,000.00 for distribution to the unsecrated creditors. 1)The bankrupt had a horrendous record for non-payment of his tax obligation which dated back at least 15 years. Not only did the bankrupt not pay his taxes he also did not file his returns. This was the second bankruptcy for this bankrupt. The sole un Secured creditor is Revenue Canada. With a proved Claim of just under $89000 for un unpaid income, it should come as no surprise that Revenue Canada was also the major creditor in the first bankruptcy. 2)The trustee calculated surplus income of $435.00 per month and recommended a conditional order requiring the payment of the $7800.00. Judgement interest would accrue on any payment in arrears. 3)The conditional order would be made in three years. The debtor was 43 years old, in good health and had two dependants but had an enviable income. He preferred the recommendation of the trustee. They had carefully reviewed the financial material on file and considered the submissions of the parties. 4)The court concluded that the bankrupt could safely accommodate a payment $500.00 monthly for three year without jeopardising his ability at the current tax obligation. Therefore there was an order requiring him to pay the sum of $18k for distribution."

She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury.

d_2005skca149.txt,"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. The Crown appealed the decision. Appeal allowed; the Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the YCJA. The sentence continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. The Youth Court Judge focused unduly on the provincial director's lack of authority to'suspend' community supervision under s. 102 and the contrast in this regard with the power of the director under s106 to suspend conditional supervision in the YCP. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1) The purpose of the Youth Courts is the same as that of the SCC in R. v. Zundel (1992), 95 D.L.R. (4th) 202 (S.C.C.) and confirmed in various other cases including R. vs. M.D.S. 45 at 1:00. 2) The Youth Courts are not separate jurisdictions. The SCC judge focused underemphasized the use of s. 103 as an expression of her decision. The decision is based on the SGC in Rizzo Rizzoli. The youth justice court judge reviewed the matter in s. 106 and, in November 2004, the provincial Director concluded that the matter was serious and remanded the respondent pending review by the Youth court pursuant to s103. The Provincial Director then issued a detention order, which was met by the youth justice courts. The detention order was set aside and the respondent was remanded in custody until review by Youth Court. The court found that the youth sentence continued over the period between the detention order and the apprehension but, until the young person was apprehended, he was deemed not to be continuing to serve the youth sentenced the young people is then serving. The Court held that the Youth Act has not been used to incorporate the power to suspend which is provided for under s103 of the Code. The fact that the respondent's sentence continued while he occupied a large time during the period before his apprehension was considered by the court, with the result that the sentence had ended prior to the matter coming before her for disposition, was not a reason to alter the order as a whole. The purpose and purpose of s103 is the SLC"

d_2006nssc26.txt,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.",The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident. The defendants claimed the headlights were not in operation when it approached the intersection and that the plaintiff was contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 a.m. A.D. The plaintiff was in the middle of a road trip and her vehicle was struck by the police vehicle. She claimed she had to look behind her to see if the lights were on. The defendant testified that he had passed the plaintiff's vehicle at dark section of highway and he did not notice the police car approaching the intersection. He claimed the plaintiffs vehicle was in a near perfect condition and that he was not aware that the lights had been in operation. The plaintiffs claim the defendant was negligent in failing to alert the police when the accident occurred. The Court cannot accept the witness' testimony as being from the second floor of the defendants' building. The third floor of a building was also used as a storage area. The Defendants claim the plaintiff failed to observe the police vehicles approaching the accident and that they were in operation at the time the accident happened. The issue before the Court is whether the plaintiffs were contributory to the accident or negligent in failure to alert police. The evidence before the court is not reliable but based on the evidence of the witness.
d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Criminal Code) relating to the issuance of a search warrant on May 3, 2005. The warrant alleged that the accountant filed fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. An earlier Information had been obtained that indicated that the applicant had filed a HST return in 2001. The applicant claimed the accountant had given him misleading and misleading information. He alleged that he was advised by the accountant that the accountants were considered fully taxable supplies with respect to HST sale in accordance to the Excise Tax Act. The accountant claimed he was dismissed as a result of the tax investigation. He demanded the return of the documents. HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the informant's evidence did not rise above the level of'suspicion' to make out reasonable and probable grounds for a warrant to search the applicant's (and his wife's) home. The nature of the breach was not difficult to understand. The standard of credibly based probability envisions practical, non-technical and common sense probability as to the existence of the facts and inferences asserted. Without denying the potential seriousness of these allegations, they fell well below the level that reasonable and likely grounds for an arrest warrant to be issued. The informant's information was found to be in error. The facts did not support reasonable apprehension of bias. The fact that the documents were found at the plaintiff's place of business and in any storage facilities occupied by the plaintiff and her husband did not raise the level which justified a search of the applicant’s home."
d_2007nspc68.txt,"The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code; having care and control of a motor Vehicle contrary to ss. 253 and 253(b) of that Code. The only issue on which the defence requested briefs was whether or not the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care or control of his motor vehicle at the relevant time. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of either offence. Although his driving was in poor condition and he was in the driver's seat when the breath demand was read, there was little danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or becoming a danger to the public. The accused's acts involved the use of the car's equipment to turn the key in the ignition to the accessories position and to play music on the stereo. The vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building; the parking brake was engaged; the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running. There was little, if any, danger of it being set into motion unintentionally, or becoming another danger to public."
d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","The Ministry of Social Services (MSA) sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. HELD: The order was granted on the condition that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The father asked that the children be returned to him directly but the mother opposed him. The mother argued that the father should continue living with the mother and take anger management courses, take anger Management courses and take a anger management course. The issues were: 1) the father's responsibility to get the children into the proper care of the mother; 2) the evidence was conclusive that the parents had not been in contact with the child for the past four years; and 3) the children's history was inconclusive as the father had admitted to using cocaine and marijuana in the past few months. The evidence showed that the mother had been in the hospital for most of her life; the father was in the military; and the children had not responded to any of the parenting services offered to the mother. HARD: The evidence was inconclusively negative. The parents had signed a PSA agreeing that the child would not be exposed to drug use or domestic violence, that the drugs would be administered at their residence, that they would abstain from alcohol and drugs, that their children would have access to health care services, that there would not been any violence between the parents and the child had not expressed any desire to use drugs, and that the family would be able to support themselves and their children. It was also agreed that the two youngest children would not have any contact with their father and that they should have access with the social services worker. The two youngest boys were apprehended by the Ministry when they were born; the oldest son was apprehended at birth as was the son; the son was in foster care for most years; the daughter was apprehended when she was born; both were in the care of their mother at the time of the order. The son had a substantial criminal record, which included 16 offences as youth; the convictions for youth offences were numerous; the mother was apprehended as a result of her relationship with the father; the accused was apprehended while the father resided with the parents; the evidence did not support the accused's allegations against the father, but the accused had not shown any indication of neglect by the mother as the accused abstained from drugs for most time; the adjudication hearing was adjourned until November 2008;"
d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The defendant brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order requiring the plaintiff to serve pre-certification notice to all persons who had booked a vacation through the defendant to a resort in Cuba. The plaintiffs also sought to have the defendant's counsel examined on her affidavit. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1) The usual approach to civil litigation does not allow for plaintiff to demand defendant produce plaintiff. Secondary the wording of s. 14 and s. 24 of the Act precludes this type of pre- certification notice. The plaintiff seeks to have that defendant direct it to provide the information of the nine property owners who have, to date, received the package. 2) The plaintiff is not seeking to compel the defendant by any means to produce a list of proposed class members. The only thing that could lead to further motions is the examination of witnesses. 3) The Court's inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised judicially and only when the relief sought cannot reasonable and realistically be obtained by the applications in some other lawful manner. 4) The wording of the affidavit is novel. The affidavit was written for the purpose of providing the plaintiff with a list. The purpose of the application was to give the defendant an opportunity to introduce the names of the potential class members who had travelled with the defendant. The examination may eventually be more broad ranging than that and could be an attempt via the defendant reaching out to other customers who may have booked through the defendants' office. The cross-examination of the plaintiff could lead the plaintiffs to other issues, including whether the defendant could contact other customers for the purposes of obtaining early settlement information. 5) The defendant has had over the last couple of years ample opportunity to acquaint itself with prospective plaintiffs through some lawful manner and the Court will not get suspended merely because this matter has been brought under The Class Action Act. The Court will continue to monitor and monitor the conduct of all persons involved in the certification process. 6) The only conclusion left was that the usual approach is to narrowly directed and sparingly employed since it serves to interfere with what otherwise would be the normal rights of parties, and others, to conduct their affairs as they see fit. The court's inherent discretion is still relevant in this case. The application for examination is dismissed."
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. The appellant was 60 years old and the respondent was 53. Both parties had some health problems. The respondent was diagnosed with breast cancer, had had surgery followed up by radiation, and was now living with her father. Both had children, born in 1984 and 1989. The parties had two adult children, aged 60 and 53. The mother had sold her house, used the proceeds to spend 4 months out of Canada, living in Hawaii and spending a monthlong vacation in Jamaica. She assumed a substantial portion of the respondent's support during the year following the one year spousals order. The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining the mother on the basis that she was over 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student."

The offer was not accepted and the matter proceeded to trial. A week after the trial was concluded and while the decision was reserved, the offer was revoked. The petitioner applies for costs against the respondent pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184B. HELD: Queen's Bench Rule 184B calls for double costs from the date of service of the offer. The fact the offer was revoked does not alter the concept in Rule 184B and the resulting sanction. The petitioner was awarded party to party costs under Column 3 up to September 14, 2010 and double party of party costs under Column 3 thereafter, together with the costs for this application. All costs were payable forthwith.","The petitioner served the respondent with a formal offer of settlement in September 2010. The offer was not accepted (and indeed never was accepted) and the case proceeded to trial. About a week after the conclusion of the trial, the petitioner revoked his offer.

The petitioner is entitled to party to a party costs in Column 3."
d_2011skca90.txt,"The respondent applied to quash the Notice of Appeal on the basis that the appeal was entirely without merit because there was no factual basis on which the appeal could have been brought, heard and disposed of. HELD: Rather than filing an appeal, the respondent should have pursued a remedy in Queen's Bench. The proper procedure would have been to apply under Queen's Bench Rule 271 to have the matter opened up and disposed of on the basis of the evidence. The matter was adjourned sine die with leave to bring the matter back to Court if the appellant is unsuccessful at Queen's Bench.","The applicant obtained an order for possession pursuant to s. 3(3) of The Recovery of Possession of Land Act, 1978 granting possession of land and premises described as 1615 Broadway Avenue, Saskatoon. The proposed appellant filed a Notice of Appeal alleging certain facts with respect to why the order ought not to have been made. HELD: The application under Rule 46.1(1) of the Court of Appeal Rules to quash the Notice of appeal was entirely without merit by reason that there was evidence before the Court and no factual basis on which the appeal could have been brought, heard and disposed of. The matter was adjourned sine die with leave to bring the matter back before the Chief Justice on five days notice should the proposed appellant be unsuccessful in the Court OF Queen's Bench."
d_2012skca52.txt,"The accused was convicted of four counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown had proceeded by indictment and the accused was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 8 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20-year Sexual Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) compliance order. At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order. If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3). Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who committed multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or altogether.","The Crown appealed the sentencing judge's order under s.490.012(1) of the Criminal Code, which directed the accused to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) for 20 years. The accused was convicted on each of four charges of sexual assault. As the Crown proceeded by indictment, he was subject to imprisonment for term not exceeding ten years on each conviction. He was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 4 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20 year SOIRA compliance order. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed. The sentencing judge erred in law in his interpretation of s. 490.013(2.1) as it did in s.476.012/3. The Court of Appeal agreed with the sentencing court's interpretation of the s.502.013 (2.2.0) of The meaning of the section is plain: offenders who commit multiple designated offences will be subject to a lifetime SOIra compliance order which consists of a 10-year firearm prohibition, aDNA order and 20 yearSOIra Compliance order. Nothing in the Criminal code suggests the lifetime duration of the order rests on the offender being sentenced separately for each offence."
d_2016skca156.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure.","The Crown sought an adjournment of the trial to allow time for a review of recently disclosed documents. The defence counsel disclosed the existence of the documents in the weeks immediately preceding the trial, in the absence of any Crown disclosure. The Crown sought to have the trial adjourned for a further time. The delay in access to the documents was significant as defence counsel had not been advised of the impending trial, and it was feared that the documents would contain information that could affect the trial judge's decision. The documents remained undisclosed as defence sought to adjourn the trial and sought new trial. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The trial judge did not err in refusing to adjourn and the Crown sought leave to further review the documents. There was no breach of s. 11(d) of the Charter. The Court reviewed the case and found that the Crown had not disclosed the documents to defence counsel in sufficient detail to allow them to be examined. As the trial had been set aside and new trial ordered, the Court was in the position of the Crown counsel that it was not able to assess the undisclosed documents to determine whether the undisclosed information could have affected the verdict. A new trial was the only remedy available."
d_2016skca37.txt,"HELD: The application was allowed and the stay of the enforcement of retroactive spousal support was granted. There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support. If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced. The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support.","The appellant applies for an order staying execution of an order for spousal support in the amount of $10,000 per month. The order provided that the respondent would have exclusive possession of the family home and the rights to spousals. The appellant argues that the Chambers judge's conclusion that he stopped paying the bills for the family house at the end of October 2015 was not supported by the evidence before him. HELD: The application is allowed. The stay is in place until the hearing of the appeal. The application to lift the stay of proceedings is allowed in respect to the enforcement of the retroactive spousa support arrears created by the January 20, 2016 interim order.

d_2016skpc19.txt,"HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with possession of child pornography. The accused was a member of the Internet Child Exploitation Unit (ICE) and had been a member for 10 years. The ICE unit investigated a number of incidents involving the accused, primarily involving the sharing of files on a shared computer. The search warrant authorized the search of the entire duplex. The Court found that the accused had in his possession child pornography, contrary to s. 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code, and that the officer had access to the files while he was on shift. The Internet Childexploitation unit investigated three computers that were seized from the accused's residence. The first computer was a laptop computer which had the operating system encrypted so that it could not be accessed without a password. The second computer was an entirely new computer which could not possibly be accessed with a password because the internal IP of the computer was tied to that VIN number and that physical MAC address was not protected. The officer testified that he could not tell if the accused’s computer was the same one because it was communicating with other computers. The court concluded that the second computer, the one with the external IP address, was the one that was being used to access the third computer and that this particular computer could not reasonably be expected to be the same. The third computer was of the type of computer that the ICE unit was using and the physical MAC addresses of the three computers were of different sizes and had different serial numbers."
d_2018skpc6.txt,"HELD: On the basis of the evidence presented by the parties’ experts and in absence of an express term in the contract, the court read in an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price and awarded the plaintiff such portion of the amount sought as was fair and reasonable. The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work.","Reliable Truck Trailer, a mobile vehicle and associated equipment repair company, was in an oral agreement with the defendant in which it agreed to provide 'call out' services on'special occasion' basis. The defendant initially paid the plaintiff's invoices as they became due, then ceased to pay as they were due. Eventually the plaintiff demanded payment of its outstanding invoicing and the defendant denied it. Reliable now brings this action to recover the amount that it says is due. HELD: The plaintiff is awarded the sum of $10,902.32. While the defendant's evidence of an implied charge for services (i.e. an amount of money charged on an actual basis) was not convincing, the Court found that a fair and reasonable price to be paid for the goods and services provided.

Defendant's counterclaim for rescission of first agreement, and repayment of monies paid under second agreement, failed where it accepted plaintiff's performance and paid consideration therefore.","This was an action brought by Fossil Fuel Development Ltd. against Tudex Petroleums Ltd. (Tudex) for breach of contract claiming damages. Fossil was hired as a fund development officer by the defendants. The defendants were not called to testify. At the material time the three principal officers of the defendants' company heard evidence from the defendant that the defendant was to bring in investment capital. The defendant denied any obligation under the contract to bring investment capital and asserted that his role in the venture was confined to the area of introducing potential investors. Fossils brought the action against the defendants for breachof contract claiming $56,500. HELD: Fossil's claim was dismissed. 1)When there was a failure of a performance by the defendant in an essential part of the contract the defendants was entitled to repudiate it. The repudiation of the agreement by the plaintiff was legitimized. An order for rescission was not necessary. 2)The defendant was not the only person involved in the transaction. The parol evidence rule was used to disallow the use of the word 'fund development officer' in the parol agreement. When there was no failure of performance by a defendant in the essential part (the contract essential part) the defendants were entitled to reject it. When a failure is a sufficient basis for rescissions the contract is legitimized and the defendant is entitled to demand rescission. 3)The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $56 million.

e_1991canlii2551.txt,"The issue in this appeal was whether a landlord can give notice of a rental increase at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease. Section of the lease provides for increases upon months notice to the tenant. The trial judge found that notice must be given months prior to the expiration of the lease. For the appellant, that notice of a rental increase may be given at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease.","The tenants entered a standard form lease in 1989. By virtue of its terms, the lease was automatically renewed for a further term of one year. However, in 1990 the rent was raised from $500 to $515. The landlord gave three months notice of the increase (three months written notice) to be effective May 1, 1990. The respondents chose not to exercise this option. The appellant offered to permit the respondents to terminate the release on three months' notice if they were unhappy with the rental increase. The respondent objected to the rental rise and made an application to the Residential Tenancies Board for determination of whether or not that increase was valid. The Board held that the three months written warning required, in the context of the standard form, to come three months before the expiration or possible renewal of the tenancy. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the decision of the trial judge and the Board's decision, that the Act and the Rent Review Act are clear. The interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Act, the Rent review Act and s. 11 of the Rent Act is clear. There is no restriction in s. of the lease as to when, during the term of the term, notice must be given. The three months minimum is required in order for a landlord to give notice of any increase in rent three months prior to the expiration of the current lease. This is not the case that the tenancy agreement did not provide for no rent increase. On the contrary, the agreement by s.11 did provide for one."

The agreement provided that the parties would live separately and that neither would claim spousal support from the other. The clause in the agreement referenced the fact that they would cohabit for more than 90 days and that this would therefore vitiate their agreement to live separate and apart. HELD: The parties signed the contract described as a separation separation agreement. The parties clearly intended to re-establish their life together as husband and wife in the fullest sense. The respondent emphasized a number of times that his desire was to see the family fully restored and together and that the employment he obtained at Melville, Saskatchewan finally permitted him to do so. He also swore that they cohabited for 10 days in May 1997 and from June of 1997. The only issue was for how long. The petitioner swore that the relationship lasted for ten days. The Respondent disputed that evidence and insisted that the period of cohabitation extended from June 30 1997 until September 18.

The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases. Here the right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence as the Court was able to assess the weight to be given to the officers' evidence.

HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2 in the Information. 1) The Court was unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the first sample was obtained within 2 hours of the accident. The Court found no evidence to support this. 2) The accused had not been properly vetted by the Crown and there was uncertainty concerning the time of the collision. The police were operating under very tight time lines. There was no evidence as to how the impugned conduct affected the weight to be given to the evidence of the Crown witnesses. The conversation was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges before trial. The accused's insistence that there were two people in the cab of the truck who he said was driving was rejected. The evidence of two Crown civilian witnesses was rejected as there was no bad intent on the part of the officers nor did find tailoring of the evidence as a consequence of the discussion."

Following a dispute between the parties as to whether the defendant's use of the property now complied with the plaintiff's land-use bylaw for a single family residence, a consent order was issued dealing with the structure of the property and how it would be used. The plaintiff sought a finding that the defendant was in contempt of the consent order, seeking enforcement of the provisions of the consent order and an order that the defendant pay a fine.

The receiver manager of the registered owner (the numbered company) under the Bankruptcy Act and the instrument appointed receiver on behalf of the secured creditor and mortgagee (HSBC Bank) applied for a vesting order. The trustee had tried to sell the real property for year. HELD: The vesting order was granted. 1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so. In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87. 2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor. The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price. The registered owner had taken no opposition. No other interests will be adversely affected. 3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment.","FIAT. The applicant registered owner under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, 1985, c. B-3 and under the Trustee in the Bank of Canada Act, 1992 as am. by the Bank bankruptcy and insolvency act, S.C. 1992, c.(27, s. 2) and under Bankruptky and InsOLvency legislation, SCC, 1992, s2, as am., by the B.C.'s Bankruptcies and Insolsvency Authority, s3, and instrument appointed receiver of the registered owner on behalf of the HSBC Bank, a secured creditor and mortgagee of certain real property of the Registered Owner applies for a vesting order with respect to a sale of the real property. The vesting orders applied for would register title in favour of the proposed purchaser of the property obtained as a result of a year long effort by the applicant trustee to sell it. The material satisfies the court that there are no other interests that will be adversely affected if the vesting ordered applied for is granted. No subsequent encumbrancers, competing creditors nor the Registered owner's rights respecting redemption or preservation of equity (there is none) are adversely affected."
e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","The appellant filed a complaint under Part II of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code alleging that the City had discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. CUPE brought a claim against the appellant for breach of contract and breach of employment agreement. The appellant argued that the tribunal erred in law in finding that the city was responsible for the discrimination, as the appellant had not been properly accommodated in the workplace due to his disability and had improperly imparted a burden akin to a vicarious liability or a fiduciary duty regarding the alleged acts of harassment which either were unknown to the supervisors of the appellant's truck or were events in which such supervisors acted appropriately in the circumstances. The tribunal also found that the appellant received 4% less in wages than other comparable City employees because of the wage differential, which was an appropriate reason for the appellant to seek permanent employment. The applicant appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The appellant was not only disadvantaged in his employment, but in his ability to perform the jobs required due to the appellant’s disability. He was also disadvantaged in the manner in which he was employed. The discrimination was systemic and it was done to disadvantage the appellant because he was a casual employee. The City was not able to accommodate the appellant due to its disability. The fact that the applicant had Cerebral Palsy and was unable to perform his job as a casual did not excuse him. He had the potential to become an employee of the City. He would have been able to access employment insurance sooner if it was available. The appeal was also dismissed. 2) The tribunal was unable, in its own way, to accommodate a discrimination complaint made against the applicant because of his disabilities. The decision of the tribunal was not reasonably based on the appellant as a person of the disability. It was simply an application of the law on the duty to accommodate, which is a vicariate liability or fiduciariate duty applicable to someone of the same age and sex. The determination of the city’ s. 18 Human Rights code was not based on fact but rather on reasonable, but rather subjective, considerations."

This was an application to set aside a noting for default and the resulting default judgment.

e_2006skca55.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the court accepting fresh evidence. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed. There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed. 1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission. 2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us. All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay. Any evidence sought to be adduced under the discretion of what is now s. 683 of the Code must be admissible evidence. With respect to the evidence of Ms. Brinkman, she does not swear that Ms. Bodkin was selling methamphetamine at the relevant time. 3) With respect to due diligence, it must be noted that the appellant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who represents him before this court. The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward. If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems. 4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered.","The appellant appeals his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the Court accepting fresh evidence. The central issue at trial was whether the drugs found at the premises being rented by one s. Bodkin belonged to the appellant or to the complainant. The appellant's evidence was rejected as not credible. The Court was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant's testimony supported the Crown's charge. The complainant did not appear to be a party to the offence, and her actions relating to the search of her basement were completely inconsistent with her being the owner of the methamphetamine which was found virtually in plain view."
e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","The parties met, married, made children and then separated. The respondent father is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins. They have not settled a division of matrimonial property. Issues [1] The majority of the claim by the respondent in this regard relates to his motor vehicle. He acknowledges it is used for personal use and states that portion to be 10 percent. The mother claims it is for personal purposes and is responsible for the capital cost allowance on real property owned by the partnership. The parties have approached this case on the basis that the most representative and fairest method of determining this self-employed father's income is three-year average under s. 17 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The analysis here is substantially different than that contained in the father's personal farming statement. The income of the petitioner is $24,300. The father will be in a small credit position which he can offset against ongoing maintenance but in amount no greater than $50 per month so as not to cause any inappropriate financial hardship on the children. When arrears by the payor occur, this Court often allows those arrear to be paid monthly. There is no reason why the overpayment by the father should not be treated in the same fashion in these circumstances. HELD: The Court held that the holding of trial was the most efficient and cheaper method of coming to the conclusion regarding the issue of maintenance than ongoing negotiation or pre-trial. The case law focused on the reasonableness of the expense as it relates to capital cost allowances and alleged personal expenses claimed on partnership returns acknowledges these are legitimate expenses used to reduce income unless it is shown they are unnecessary or unreasonable. The Court was not prepared to add back to income in any of the three years leading up to the issue."

e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","The appellant appealed a Queen's Bench decision allowing this appeal and setting aside the order of the Chambers judge on the basis that he acted without any evidence that certain activities of the children were extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The chambers judge did not specifically say that he considered these expenses to be extraordinary within the Meaning of s. 7(1)(f) and s.7(1.1) of the Guidelines. He referred only to the costs of Ashley's Tae Kwan Do and soccer and to Mitchell's soccer. 2) The appellant's liability was for 73% of all eligible s. expenses, which he received tax free. 3) The respondent argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to pay proportionately to the extracurricular activities, which were ordinary, which means the respondent is expected to pay the cost of the ordinary activities out of her income, including the child support of $2,532.00 that she receives monthly. 4) The Chamber judge had the necessary evidence before him that he is required to consider to make his decision whether all, some, or none of the expenses are extraordinary within s. seven(1(1) and the Guidelines, and he did not make a palpable and overriding error nor did he err in law."
e_2008skpc108.txt,"The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home. They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13.

Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.","The plaintiff and defendant entered a contract for the construction of a glass sunroom with the defendant.

The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence.

e_2012skpc43.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with operating while over.08 contrary to ss. 253(2) and 254(1(a) as well as with operating vehicles while his blood alcohol content exceeded.08. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The breach was not the result of wilful or blatant disrespect of the Charter by the officer nor was it a result of a wilful, blatant disrespect by the employer. There was nothing in the evidence to suggest that the officer wilfully or recklessly disregarded the rights of the accused. The officer was subjectively believed that he had reasonable grounds pursuant to s254(3) ofthe Code to arrest the accused for impaired driving and to make demand for breath samples. However, the officer subjectively thought that he could arrest the officer for impaired impaired driving, nor did he have the grounds to arrest for impaired drinking, thus the arrest was unlawful, the search was unlawful and the rights were violated. The Court held that there was no breach of s. 8 or s. 9 of the charter and that the admission of evidence would be beneficial to society. However the Court held: (i) if a Charter breach was made out, the admission should be admitted; (ii) if there were insufficient grounds to grant the certificate of analysis; (iii) if the Certificate of Analysis was excluded. The admission would not harm society as a whole."
e_2012skqb498.txt,"The defendant applied pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 169 for leave to amend his Statement of Defence. This is a defamation action and the amendment would add that the words spoken by the defendant were true and that the alleged defamation was justified in law. The action relates to statements made about the plaintiff's failure to properly read an X-ray and his failure to pass certain certification exams and that health officials knew that he should not be performing the work he was doing. There is another defamation action, described in this judgment as the College Action. The defendant applied pursuant to Rule 41(2) that his action and the College Action be tried together because there are common issues of fact between the two, albeit different actions.  Trying them together would be in the interests of judicial economy and avoid the possibility of conflicting findings. HELD: The Court ordered that the two actions be tried one immediately after the other in the manner determined by the trial judge and that the defendant be given leave to amend his Statement of Defence.","FIAT: The defendant applied for an order for an inquiry into statements that the plaintiff alleges were made by the defendant in 2009 regarding the plaintiff's failure to properly read an x-ray and alleged health officials knew the plaintiff should not be doing the work he was doing. The statements alleged to be made by defendant in the 2009 action were published both before and after June 1, 2009. The defendant counterclaimed the statements were justified in law, alleging defamation. HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the statements made by defendants in the 2010 action were true and that trying these actions together would be in the interests of judicial economy and justice. A judge ordered that the actions be tried one after the other, with the College Action proceeding first, and the evidence in the College action be evidence. The order in which the trials were conducted, the use of evidence from one action in the other and any other matters that must be addressed were better left for the trial judge."
e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. They attended a French language school (École de Bellegarde) for the benefit of their four siblings. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children's provisional permission to attend was not extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless children filed a complaint with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging that the school had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. The Court granted provisional permission in August 2013 to the Lawlessness children to attend the school. The family applied to strike the statement of claim as an abuse of process. HELD: The Court found that the Lawlers had failed to live up to their ten commitments as a parent and family. The CÉF has failed to provide an educational environment free from discrimination, harassment and discrimination. The Family has failed, and continues to fail, to provide a French first language school.  1) The Court rejected the Lawler's application for an interlocutory injunction as an attempt to undermine their ten year tradition of attending a French school. 2) The Family was not consulted with the Court about the application for a declaration that the CÉFS discriminated against the Lawrays because of their disability. The Act distinguishes between 'conseil scolaire fransaskois' and 'conceil ecole fransaska'. The parties consistently referred to the CéF as the 'CÉF'. The CéLeste is a conseil Scolaire created by s. 42.1 of The Education Act to exercise general supervision and control over French language instruction programs and fransascolas in Saskatchewan. The Education act distinguishes between a 'conselil scule fransaspois' (CSF) and 'counsel' (conseile ecole). The parties clearly stated that the CSF's ostensible concern about the Lawling family's failure to liveup to their commitments was not the real reason for its decision to not renew their provisional permission. The CSF has demonstrated that it has a duty to provide quality educational instruction in a French First Language School to its children. The principles and goals of the CCEF are met in accordance with their respective constitutions. The court awarded the Lawlings special damages for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the costs of preparing the materials for the materials and preparing the necessary support to the end of the school year for their continued education. The award of general"
e_2015skqb345.txt,HELD: The court granted summary judgment for the defendants. It held that it could determine the defendants’ application prior to the plaintiffs’ application for certification. The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages. The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence. There was no genuine issue requiring a trial. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them. It was not necessary to decide the application for certification.,"The original plaintiff issued his claim under The Class Actions Act for breach of consumer protection and sale of goods legislation, breach of warranty, negligence the Competition Act and waiver of tort. The claim seeks damages against the defendants, Loblaws, and the defendants. The claims claim that the plaintiffs were misled and misled by the defendants' misleading and deceptive advertising. The defendants claim that they should receive summary judgment in favour of their claim, because the facts are not disputed and the determination of a single legal issue will decide whether the plaintiffs have a tenable cause of action. HELD: The application for summary judgment was granted. The plaintiff's affidavit was examined and the dates and times of the certification hearing were determined. The court reviewed the expert evidence and found that: 1) the defendants acknowledge that they have put identical products on the market but labelled these identical products differently. 2) the facts were undisputed. The only reason to label and market identical products is to create the illusion that the identical products are different. 3) While there may be a genuine issue for trial, the Court found that it is not the Court's job to decide the plaintiffs' application for dismissal. The Court held that it was important to follow the judicial authority and determine the defendants’ summary judgment application prior to making the certification application. There was no genuine issue to be had with respect to the claims as a class as a whole. The more evidence there was, the more likely it was that the defendants had an obvious defence to the claim."
e_2015skqb412.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice. The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the information put forward by the respondent was not sufficient to require an assessment. As the respondent had not followed the court's standard of fairness and accuracy, it was not in the court’s interest to extend the time for the assessment. The respondent’S request was not fair and there were no properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the applicant. The respondents’ affidavits did not establish the length of time between the appointment of the bills and the time at which the assessment was requested."
e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The Court found the petitioner’s Federal Child Support Guidelines were accurate and directed that he pay interim child support in the amount of $1,949 and interim spousal support in that amount. The petitioner also claimed that the respondent had unilaterally transferred their son, ostensibly because he was not receiving sufficient attention at Argyle. The respondent subsequently applied for interim child and spousals support and an equal division of family property. The court found the respondent’ s Federal Child Tax Credit to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed interim spouse and child support of $5,250.00. The Court also found the appellant’S Federal Child Services Guidelines to be in excess in excesses of $250,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner was awarded interim child care and spouse support in addition to child support and child and child maintenance.  2) The Court reviewed the financial statements and personal tax returns and found the child to be doing well in the chosen field. The children’re educational needs were met primarily through the care of their son. D.K. was an intelligent and pleasant boy, who was generally well-behaved. He was active in the community and enjoyed spending time with his friends. He and the respondent, who had recently moved to Canada, had a son, who resided with them for the past four years. DK.’d been attending Grade 5 at the time of the birth and was doing well academically. He also had a grade 7 education. He worked part-time and was able to assist with the child’ss education and health care needs. The child was attending classes at a private school and was involved in the daily activities of the child. The father was working part- time and was responsible for the child care needs of the school and the child and the mother. The mother was also involved in her son’situation. The parties had a child and a young child. D’K. had a varied educational background. He had recently transferred from a private university to a university. He earned a C in the sciences and had a doctorate in education. DQ. was attending a public school. He lived with the mother for the first three weekends of each month and for the last two months of that month. He shared night call responsibilities three to four times per month and stayed home with the son. He did not attend any parties. The family relocated to Saskatoon in the fall of 2012."
