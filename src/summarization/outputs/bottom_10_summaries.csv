d_1993canlii6612.txt,"On appeal from 106 SaskR 277. 47 year old respondent, former President and Chief Executive Officer of STC, had been awarded $165,000 (18 months) for wrongful dismissal. He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company (STC) by Leo Larsen, its former president and chief executive officer. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, first, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as in the ensuing months are either earned or should be earned in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum. The Crown Employment Contracts Act set aside contractual provisions for payment on dismissal contained in all Crown contracts, and directed instead that payment be determined in accordance with common law principle.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company by Leo Larsen, its former president and chief executive officer.

The salary was calculated on the premise his annual salary was $102,000, not $110,000. He resisted the attribution on pragmatic grounds arguing that the company had not paid him any salary; that there was no guarantee the company was going to earn profit; that it needed working capital; and so on. Finally, he contended that attributing even the net income to him for the purpose of mitigation would be inconsistent with Foster v. MTI Canada Ltd. (an unreported decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal dated July 16, 1992). HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The trial judge did not err in determining the period of notice to which Mr. Larsen was entitled at common law to disregard all but his year of service with STC. Any other approach could have been inconsistent with precedent. 2)Costs for the trial judge were set aside. The Crown Employment Contracts Act set aside the contractual provisions for payment on dismissal contained in all Crown contracts including those of Crown corporations and directed instead that payment be determined in accordance with common law principle. With that in mind he calculated that the loss was of no moment. The evidence was convincing: Larsen at the time of his dismissal was a career civil servant, skilled and dedicated."" 3)The severance terms of the contract were arrived at with an eye to his earlier service. Indeed they were inserted on the premises he had been in the service of the Crown since February 1, 1982, the day he joined Sask. Housing, and was moving to Regina while her husband was in Saskatoon."
2_2005skpc38.txt,"The accused is charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused had been on duty in a marked police car when the accused's vehicle rolled forward into him. At trial, the Crown called three witnesses and the accused testified that he had received a radio message asking him to assist another officer on a 'non-priority' matter in the south-west part of the province. The defence then called four witnesses, including the accused, to testify that the officer had advised the accused that the most direct route to the area he was called to was via cross-walk, and that the accused had rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot, and not at a fast or accelerating speed. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charge. 1) The accused's actions in operating his vehicle on the road beside Super Store constituted careless driving, as distinguished from dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. The actions of the accused which could be considered careless are, firstly, the speed at which he drove past Super Store, and secondly, his driving forward into Mr. Kuchar. The officer's evidence that he did not touch the accelerator, and briefly took his foot off the brake, and then immediately reapplied the brake after seeing the vehicle was directly in front of the police vehicle. The Crown argued that neither seat belt, belonging to Mr. Tyndall or Mr. Rostotski, locked upon striking the officer. This assertion was based on the totality of the officer's driving, and accepted that distance was at most one foot. The evidence of the defence witnesses who testified that neither was waving their arms or giving any other cause for concern other than the statement to his wife saying 'that vehicle could slow down' did not lock upon impact. The Court reviewed four areas where there was inconsistency and conflict in the evidence given by Crown and defence witnesses. The first issue was whether the accused has shown on balance of probabilities that he exercised due diligence, or took reasonable care, on this date. Based on his evidence, and the findings of fact have made, am satisfied that he has shown that the Crown has proved that the driving by the accused was careless. In particular, the Court accepted that his vehicle rolled into the officer as he was crossing the street outside of the crosswalk and that he immediately took steps both to assist and to have other officers attend at the scene. The standard to be applied was set out by the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charge. 1) The accused's actions in operating his vehicle on the road beside a cross-walk constituted careless driving as distinguished from dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. The actions of the accused which could be considered careless are, firstly, the speed at which he drove past Super Store, and then his driving forward into Mr. Kuchar. The accused should have simply continued driving.  2) Given the nature of the situation and the fact that the accused was on duty in a marked police car, he could not have reasonably anticipated that a person would have been so close in front of him and that his vehicle did not accelerate and did not move quickly before striking him. There was inconsistency and conflict in the evidence given by Crown and defence witnesses. 3) The officer's vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerating speed."
3_1998canlii1847.txt,"The Workers' Compensation Board applied, by way of stated case, to have the Court answer questions with respect to the interpretation of certain provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act. There were 40 questions in total. The Court was asked to relate the questions to 19 factual summaries presented by the Board concerning cases before it. The Court was required to decide whether the questions were the proper subject matter of a stated case. Dismissing the stated case application, that the questions submitted are hypothetical and speculative. They are therefore inappropriate questions for a stated case, which requires that questions must be responsive to the facts and must not be speculative.","The appellant appealed the dismissal of its application for the stated case dismissal. Application dismissed; questions submitted by the appellant in Hebb v. Family and Children's Services were not responsive to the evidence or to any determination made to date in the case and, indeed, by their very wording were speculative and hypothetical.","The Court dismissed the application.

e_2017skqb219.txt,"HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent. They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.","The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother who is making an application for joint custody of the two children. HELD: 1) There is no difficulty determining that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest regarding the children. The children are now 10 and 9 years old and the mother has a 'blood tie' to the children, as seven of his nine years have been spent living in the grandmother's home. It is apparent the children have lived with the grandmother for the past nine years. 2) The grandmother has a reasonable and liberal access with the children and she is willing to provide the father with parenting time with them. 3) An interim order was granted in March 2009 specifying the father would have supervised access for the children for three weekends in a row with no access on the fourth weekend. The grandmother was granted interim custody in August 2015. 4) The court reviewed the extensive affidavit material filed and heard from counsel on behalf of both the mother and the father. It was clear there were concerns regarding the father's use of alcohol and drugs. The evidence showed that he smoked marijuana and'maybe' hashish but said he never did meth on a regular basis. He opposed the mother's claim for custody and requested a lump sum payment of $69,000. 5) There was an interim order in place in January 2016 that continued the father’s access for two years. This designation was made pursuant to s. 6 of the Children’S Law Act, 1997, 1997. The designation of the grandmother was not binding when considering whether or not to grant person- sufficient interest status to the grandmother after having heard all of the evidence at trial.  6) The Court was dealing with a request by a third party “friend” of the children to move from the primary care of the mother to his primary care. The parties’ second child, Arty, was born while the mother was in the hospital. He was absent for approximately four years. The father was granted supervised access in January 2015. The matter was adjourned over to the specific date of August 2016.","The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother of the two children, who is the biological mother of the children. The grandmother argues she is person of sufficient interest with respect to the children and seeks an order that she and the father should have joint custody of the boys but her home be the children's primary residence. HELD: 1) The grandmother is a person with sufficient interest. The designation is made pursuant to s. 6 of The Children's Law Act, 1997. 2) It is not disputed that the mother and father commenced a cohabitating relationship in January 2005 when the mother was 18 and she was living with the father. His access was stated to be 'no more than one hour per week'. He opposed the mother's claim for custody and her request that the children be designated beneficiaries of any life insurance, pension plan or health care plan he owned. The court reviewed the extensive affidavit material filed and heard from counsel on behalf of both parties and found that the grandmother had sufficient interest in the children as she was the primary caretaker of them. 3) There is an interim order designating the grandmother as Person of sufficient Interest on an interim basis that the father be declared to be the father of the three children. It is only if the grandmother grants the appropriate status that she can apply for custody. 4) The court has no difficulty determining whether or not the grandmother has sufficient interest regarding the children, as it is clear there were concerns regarding the father's use of alcohol and drugs prior to the death of the mother. The father represented himself at trial. He was very prepared and adequately conducted his case before the court."

Corrigendum received dated March 19, 2010 and added to fulltext.","The accused entered a guilty plea to committing an assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code.

He had two previous convictions related to this offence. 3)The court determined that the offence was not one for which incarceration was appropriate, taking into consideration the facts, the severity of the injuries and the minor criminal records of the accused."
1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The plaintiff sought to have the defendant's solicitor disburse funds from mortgage draws on behalf of the project. The defendant had received a number of irrevocable letters of direction, which he acknowledged, requiring him to pay the mortgage brokerage and architectural fees from the mortgagees. In early 1987, the first mortgagee to the project had become dissatisfied with the handling of project funds by one of the principals of and was withdrawing its support. At the meeting, the defendant suggested that he retain separate legal counsel to deal with the second mortgagee problem and the creditor-suppliers dispute. He requested postponement of the mortgage draws in order to allow for sufficient funds to be disbursed. The plaintiff sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation and breach of trust. Any claim under this ground is dismissed. The plaintiffs have not established the basis for a claim under breached trust and cannot succeed on this ground.","The plaintiffs sought to have the defendant's solicitor disburse funds from mortgage draws and insurance claims from two mortgage brokers to the project. The defendant had previously disbursed funds to various creditors in response to a request from one of the creditors to disburse mortgage advances from the second mortgagee.

The plaintiff also alleged negligent misrepresentation and in the alternative, breach of undertaking or breach of trust."

The only issue at trial was whether this made the accused guilty of the offence of driving a motor vehicle on a highway while his licence was revoked contrary to s.287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The words'motor vehicle' and 'ruck' in the Act do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an ATv on the roadway.

The accused could not have obtained a license to drive the ATV on the road because it was a prohibited motor vehicle. It was vehicle of the wrong type or class to get license. The Crown argued that since the accused was driving motor vehicle and his 'driver's license' was revoked he was guilty of this offence. The defence argued that it is not that simple. The intention to not exempt ATV’s from all references to “motor vehicles” was clear when he said at paragraph 37: “It is my view that Mr. Boutilier could be charged with an offence of operating motor vehicle in the highway, or for speeding and would be liable for any damages arising in the event of an accident.” The words “Motor vehicle” in the act include only those types or classes of vehicles for which one can obtain a license.

1998canlii3382.txt,"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year.

In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation.

6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff decided to purchase a home. She engaged the services of a realtor associated with the defendant, 100% Realty Associates, operating as RE/MAX Saskatoon. After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased the home in 1998. The realtor, Cecilia Mui, was hired to assist the plaintiff with the purchase of the home. The plaintiff sued the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She says that Ms. Mui and her company fell below the standard of care required of the realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. HELD: 1) The plaintiff sues the defendants for recovery of $400,000.00.  2) The property was purchased the following year. It was owned by the defendants, Edward and Verl Karpinski. Their realtor was the defendant Mario Jacobucci, the owner of the last defendant, Trevi Holdings Ltd. 3) The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She was concerned that the property was too expensive for her to afford. There was no discussion about extending the deadline to remove the conditions so that further investigations into the condition of the house could be carried out. The search for a suitable home expanded to acreages in the neighbouring environs.  4) The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to damages against the defendants based upon mental and emotional distress, aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against them, asserting that their acts and omissions exacerbated her distress.  5) The defendant was liable to the plaintiff in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the plaintiff.  6) The Court found the plaintiff to be entitled to special and general damages, including damages based on mental, emotional distress and aggravated damages, as well as punitive damages, against the defendant and the plaintiff for breach of the terms of the contract.","The plaintiff decided to purchase a home. She hired the services of a realtor associated with the defendant, 100% Realty Associates, operating as RE/MAX Saskatoon. After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased the property in 1998. The property did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. HELD: 1) The home was not within the plaintiff’s means. The realtor was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. 2) The property was too expensive for the plaintiff to afford. The search for suitable home expanded to acreages in the neighbouring environs. 3) The first time the plaintiff visited the property, she was interested in a wood-paneled home heated by wood. She wanted to ensure that there was also a gas line onto the property. She asked the realtor to find out if she could rely on the PCDS. 4) The second time she visited the home she was more concerned about the state of the home than the actual condition of it. The PCDS would reveal to her any conditions of the property that were not readily apparent. There was no discussion about home inspection. It was clear from reading of the building permit that the rural municipality did not do any inspections of moved or newly constructed residences."
e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","HELD: The Court found that the plaintiffs’ claim was an abuse of process. The court found that s. 23 of the Charter gives it an exclusive and unfettered authority to decide whether it will admit any non-gifted children to attend a fransaskois school in Saskatchewan, and neither the Court nor the SHRC may inquire into its reasons or interfere with the exercise of its discretion.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield. The Lawless children attended a French language school for two years. In February 2013, the defendant informed the family that the children's provisional approval to attend a fransaskois school would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The family applied to strike out the statement of claim. HELD: The application to dismiss the claim was reserved, while the application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed with written reasons to follow. The Court's reasons for decision were: 1) the plaintiffs did not seem to grasp what was required of them by the CÉF. 2) the parents' failure to live up to their ten commitments was not the real reason for their decision to refuse to renew their provisional permission. 3) the court found that the parents had failed to meet their obligations under s. 42.1 of The Education Act.  4) the Court found that it was in the best interests of the children to continue attending the school because support for their success did not exist in this case. The court found the parents to be conseil scolaires created by s.42.1 to exercise general supervision and control over French language instruction programs and franaskois schools in Saskatchewan.  5) The Court held that the plaintiffs' claim should be struck as an abuse of process because the plaintiffs never applied for judicial review to set aside the appeal decision rendered by the elected directors of the CéF, and the parties consistently referred to the defendant as the 'CÉF' from this point forward."
