The defendant argued that the attachment order was an intrusive pre-trial remedy and that its existence would hinder any attempt by the plaintiff to resume or expand its operations.

The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","FIAT: 1) The respondent applied for an interim order granting sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s.7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, being October 2005. The petitioner, Evan Gavelin, requested joint custody with specified access. While he acknowledged an obligation to pay child support and there was an issue as to his income and whether the interim order should be made retroactive, the petitioner had not received any income from the company prior to the separation. 2) The parties' verbal agreement at the time of separation was that the petitioner would have the children during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. There was nothing in the evidence before the trial judge that rebutted that presumption on an interim basis. The purpose of interim orders is to establish temporary parenting arrangements pending a trial or final resolution of the matter. In making such orders, Courts try to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible and, for that purpose, often adopt the'status quo' subject always to that arrangement being in the best interests of the child. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement which the parties entered into following their separation. 3) The petitioner's income was substantially less than the respondent's. Given the age and circumstances of his children, there is an issue regarding his income. 4) The interim order granted retroactive child support to January 1, 2006 is warranted. 5) It appears from the limited evidence before this Court that Ms. Pateman’s income is substantially less that that of the petitioner. Given his current income and the fact that the respondent refused to allow him parenting time if he did not agree to pay her the amount of child support she demanded, retroactive the order was warranted. 6) The Court was not prepared to impose a retroactive order on the petitioner based on his income as that was the basis for the original agreement.","1) The respondent, Nevada Pateman, applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties’ two children and child support, including s. 7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, being October, 2005.

HELD: The appeal was allowed and the lease was valid for one year. The landlord refused to consent, giving his reasons why he believed it was not in his interest to have a month-to-month tenancy. The Residential Tenancies Officer gave no consideration to the landlord's reasons for withholding consent and in particular made no finding that the reasons were unreasonable. The lease had been renewed for 1 year. An arbitrary decision would be one that is random or based on purely personal whim. An unreasonable one would have no credible rationale.","[2] This is an appeal by the Landlord from an order of the Director dated August 31, 2009. That order effectively permitted the Tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month one. About four months before the expiry of the second year, the Tenant gave a proper notice that he wished to convert the tenancy into a month to month tenancy, pursuant to the provisions of s.10A of the Residential Tenancies Act, which provides: [5] The Landlord responded within thirty days and refused to consent, giving his reasons why he believed that it was not in his interest to have a month to month tenancy. [7] The Residential Tenancies Officer stated in his reasons that based upon his reading of the Residential Tenancies Act, the Landlord “may not deny the tenant’s request that the lease be changed from a year to year lease to a month to month effective September 1, 2009.” In so failing to consider the Landlord’s reasons, I believe that the Residential Tenancy Officer erred in law. It places the Landlord in the centre of a consenting process and allows the Landlord to exercise some judgment, with the constraint that it not be arbitrary or unreasonable. [13] The reasons of the Landlord here are that, in his experience, this particular flat is much more difficult to lease out at any time of the year other than September 1, which has become almost a standard moving day in south end Halifax, in part because that is the start day for most student apartments. [17] In the result, I allow the appeal and declare that the tenancy has not been converted into a month to month tenancy, because the Landlord refused his consent in a timely manner, for reasons that were neither arbitrary or unreasonable. [22] The Landlord wants the lease to terminate on August 31, 2010, but to alleviate hardship he has unconditionally undertaken to accept an early termination on any date from May 31, 2010 (his undertaking refers to 2009, but I believe that is a typo) until August 31, 2010.",0.48732943469785567,0.47161572052401746,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","This is an appeal by the Landlord from an order of the Director dated August 31, 2009.

It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated. The application is dismissed.","HELD: The application was dismissed.

The amended defence claimed that settlement involving the payment of $100,000 had been reached pursuant to which Ochapowace had paid $40,000 with $60,000 remaining due and owing. The defendant sought an order pursuant to Rule 231 of the Queen's Bench Rules compelling the plaintiff to complete the undertakings given at the examination of Walter Guylas November 30, 2004 within 30 days. The application for an order returning the money was not granted as the plaintiff was unable to obtain the information from other persons as there were no persons the defendant was entitled to examine without the requested Order.

5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right.

The accused was found to have consumed alcohol in a quantity that exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The Crown called all its evidence on the first date and the matter was adjourned over two lengthy adjournments for the possibility of calling an expert in relation to the neurological condition of the accused. Defence raised the possibility the accused had not spoken to a lawyer in the past 10 minutes due to his physical condition. The officer examined the scene of the accident and observed the accused in the driver's seat and with the vehicle keys in his hand. The police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a legal counsel. The evidence showed the accused was in care or controlling of the motor vehicle. The court found that the officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the victim. He wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. All of the requirements of s. 254(3) were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court found that while the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe he had de facto care orcontrol of an inoperable motor vehicle and that he had not rebutted the presumption in s. 258(1)(a).","[1] The accused stands charged as follows:

The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with care or control of a motor vehicle after an accident. The accused was found to have consumed alcohol in a quantity that exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: 1)Since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, with no risk of setting it in motion, the police officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. He wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. The totality of the evidence would lead any reasonable person to that conclusion. 2)The accused had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath or that it would be impracticable to put him before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The evidence showed the accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. 3)All of the requirements of s.254(3) had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found the accused had not rebutted the presumption in s.258(1)(a) as envisaged by the case law. 4)The Court reviewed the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl (2002 SKCA (CanLII), [2002] S.J. No.14) and reviewed Schnell's dominant or controlling purpose during the critical overlap period. The Court held the accused was 'in care of the motor vehicle pursuant to the presumption.'","[1] The accused stands charged as follows:

1) on or about the 23rd day of January, A.D. 2004 at or near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan did while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug have the care or control of a motor vehicle contrary to section 255(1) and section 253(a) of the Criminal Code. 2) on or about the 23rd day of January, A.D. 2004 at or near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan did having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood have care or control of a motor vehicle contrary to section 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a). The court hereby finds the accused was “in care or control” of the motor vehicle pursuant to the presumption in s. 258(1)(a). [29] Considering the case law, the submissions of counsel and after objectively considering all the indicia of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicated driving error), there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(3) to make a demand for samples of analysis. In the circumstances, the court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation.

The Crown called all its evidence on the first date and the matter was adjourned over two lengthy adjournments for the purpose of canvassing the possibility of calling an expert in relation to the neurological condition of the accused.

1994canlii4796.txt,"The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act. 2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy. The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused. 3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan. 4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer.

The child will have access at her parents' home. 2)The court found that the child's psychological parent and their psychological home was with the mother who wished to relocate. The evidence established that the petitioner's research and knowledge of the nursing program was sketchy and vague, she did not provide evidence on daycare facilities nor potential arrangements for childcare. The court allowed the mother's application to move to Edmonton with the consent of the parties' parents. 3)The children's relationship with their psychological parent is only relevant in the exceptional case where it impacts on that parent's ability to meet the child’s needs. 4)The best interests of the children are only relevant if the child is allowed to relocate to Edmonton.

The Department had been very much involved in the child protection effort. The oldest child, who had been diagnosed as having Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), had been attending classes with the idea of getting her grade and eventual grade XII. She apparently exhibited symptoms of ADD and was referred for medical diagnosis which found there to be a problem. The Minister had been advised that the children needed protection from domestic disharmony and domestic violence. The child's mother had been in denial of the children's needs for years and had always been more anxious about excusing the mother than about protecting the children. The mother had always appeared more anxious to excuse herself than about protect the children and it was doubtful that she recognizes or accepts that when she fails to properly supervise or protect the child it is either because she does not recognize the needs of the child or if she does, she cannot will herself into action. The father was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for sexual assault. The youngest child was sentenced 18 months imprisonment. The court ordered that all three of the three children be permanently committed to the minister. The Director of Social and Family Development was ordered to supervise and protect the three and to provide support to the mother. The Court was also ordered to have the mother's testimony before the Court. The evidence showed that the mother had not been able to control the children herself. The Father was sentenced 16 months imprisonment and the mother was to be sentenced to 11 months imprisonment with the possibility of parole. The Mother had always seemed anxious about leaving the children with the father.

c_1999skqb178.txt,"Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute. The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","The parties were married for seven years and had three children. The father was unrepresented at trial. Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in this proceeding, there were also questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The mother was insistent that the tapes were of central importance to her case and that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated the abuse that was occurring in the mother's home. The court allowed the tapes to be admitted in their entirety but on the condition they went in unedited. The Court was of the view they had the opposite effect. They spoke volumes about the father's character and motivations while shedding little light on the mother’s. The tapes were primarily conversations between the father and the children. There was a petulant and protracted outburst from the mother about the fact that her boyfriend was drinking and that she was afraid that he would get put down by her friends. The evidence showed that the mother was mentally ill and abusive to the children and that the father was trying to force her to get out of the house. The tape recordings were inadmissible unless their authenticity is established, they are shown to be true and unaltered record and the voices have been properly identified. The respondent rejected the custody assessment and the access assessment. HELD: The tapes could not be admitted. 1)The evidence was not admitted. The children were not in any way excluded from the proceedings. 2)The court was of a view that the tape recordings had the effect of discrediting the mother and her dysfunctional relationships with the children, which was not supported by the evidence. The video evidence was found to be of no relevance to the trial. The parents were not involved in a conflict of interest. The parties were not at odds with each other. The only issue was the extent to which the evidence could be found to support the father’ s position that the evidence was of central interest to the parties. The videotape evidence was allowed to be released on the conditions that it went in the unedited format.

The evidence was that the children had been in constant conflict with the mother and that she was always trying to get the attention of her children. 6) The Court found that the evidence was not of the central importance of the father. The Court concluded that the tape evidence did not have the desired effect on the children as it did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that the parents were involved in a consistent pattern of dysfunctional, conflictual communication and that their relationship was one of complete lack of trust.","[1] Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in this proceeding, there are questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that require resolution before the parties can put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown.

3_1997canlii11217.txt,"Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them. The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996. The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions.","The petitioner brothers were three brothers from the District of Perdue, Saskatchewan who carried on a family farm operation and operated a farm implement dealership. In 1985, the accountant for the petitioner firm recommended that they become involved in certain real estate partnerships, in order to derive certain tax advantages. The petitioner accountant failed to pay the petitioner's indebtedness and the petitioner subsequently agreed to become a member of the respondent's second real estate partnership. The Petitioners alleged that the petitioner had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to the filing of the petition. HELD: The petitioner was found to be indebted to the petitioner in the amounts claimed. 1)The petitioner had ceased to meet his liabilities generally as they become due. It was common ground that the respondent had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. 2)The Petitioners had proven to the satisfaction of the Bankruptcy Court that the applicant had committed an act of bankruptcy. No adequate explanation was offered by the petitioner for his failure to pay his obligations. 3)The respondent had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two real estate ventures. The evidence established that the appellant was a wealthy individual who was quite capable of paying his debts but had simply chosen not to do so. 4)The applicant had received significant tax advantages from his involvement with the two partnerships.","This is an application by the petitioners, Thomas

4_2015skca111.txt,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","The parties agreed in October 2014 to vary the 2011 Variation Order to include a change in the primary residence of the petitioner. The parties had previously agreed to vary it in 2012. In May 2011, the parties agreed to fix support by varying the 2011 order. In 2012, the petitioner applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for a variation of the 2011 variation order. The petitioner appealed the order. HELD: The Court of Appeal held that the Court could vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support. The Court held that it drew a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an ongoing basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. The court held that in the area of family support orders, the courts draw a clear line between interim and final order. It held that there was no expressly legislated power to vary an order on a matter that was final. The courts drew a distinction between an interim order and a final orders, and the Court held the respondent had not been advised of changes in circumstances. The respondent had no right to make a change to any order of a brother judge unless there was agreement by counsel for the party and again have no right if there is agreement by the party, and again, have no power to sit in appeal on any order granted by a brother. The appellant had no power under the 2011 Ordinance to vary a final Order. The applicant had no authority to make any change in circumstances prior to the 2011 Order.","Appeal dismissed [1] This is an appeal from the decision of Turcotte J. on October 16, 2014, ordering Daniel Prescesky to pay retroactive child support to his former wife, Mandy Lantz, in the amount of $21,645 and costs in the amount of $1,500 (Prescesky v Prescesky, 2014 SKQB 334 (CanLII), 456 Sask R 306 [Prescesky]). Analysis [28] Mr. Prescesky submits that Turcotte J. erred: (i) by varying the 2011 Variation Order, which he submits was a final order issued by consent of the parties in accordance with their prior agreement; (ii) by varying the 2011 Variation Order without first finding a material change in circumstances; (iii) by misapprehending the facts when he found Mr. Prescesky did not advise Ms. Lantz of changes to his circumstances; and (iv) by misapprehending the facts by failing to find unreasonable delay. (a) Did Turcotte J. have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 Variation Order? (b) Was it necessary to find a material change in circumstances before the 2011 Variation Order could be varied? A. Did Turcotte J. have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 Variation Order? [35] Second, he argues that in the area of family support orders, the courts draw a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. Whether the Court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support is governed not by common law principles, but by the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, c 3 (2d Supp). [53] I will now turn to consider the nature of the orders in question and the authority that can be invoked to sustain their variation. [72] In short, I conclude that Turcotte J. did not err by concluding he had the authority to vary the 2011 Variation Order and to order Mr. Prescesky to pay arrears arsing before it and compelling him to pay the Guidelines amount for the period following it. B. Was it necessary to find a material change in circumstances before the 2011 Variation Order could be varied? By the terms of the 2011 Variation Order, the parties left to a future court the finalization of the amount of child support based on Mr. Prescesky’s income.  Faced with this state of affairs and these words, the Court of Queen’s Bench retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances. [77] Turcotte J. also found that “there was no unreasonable delay on Mandy’s part in seeking a retroactive review of Daniel’s child support obligation” (para. 48).

The Court found that the parties had not erred by varying the 2011 order. It also held that the Court could not overturn a decision of a different judge dealing with the same lis. The court also held in favour of Turcotte J. that the courts draw a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. In this appeal, the Court argued that the court had not followed Frey, nor did it err by failing to find unreasonable delay. It held that in the area of family support orders, the courts drew a clear line between interim and final order and that, in the case of a child support order, the court could not make an order to'relieve injustices'.","Appeal dismissed [1] This is an appeal from the decision of Turcotte J. on October 16, 2014, ordering Daniel Prescesky to pay retroactive child support to his former wife, Mandy Lantz, in the amount of $21,645 and costs in the amount of $1,500 (Prescesky v Prescesky, 2014 SKQB 334 (CanLII), 456 Sask R 306 [Prescesky]). Analysis [28] Mr. Prescesky submits that Turcotte J. erred: (i) by varying the 2011 Variation Order, which he submits was a final order issued by consent of the parties in accordance with their prior agreement; (ii) by varying the 2011 Variation Order without first finding a material change in circumstances; (iii) by misapprehending the facts when he found Mr. Prescesky did not advise Ms. Lantz of changes to his circumstances; and (iv) by misapprehending the facts by failing to find unreasonable delay.

B. Was it necessary to find a material change in circumstances before the 2011 Variation Order could be varied? By the terms of the 2011 Variation Order, the parties left to a future court the finalization of the amount of child support based on Mr. Prescesky’s income.  Faced with this state of affairs and these words, the Court of Queen’s Bench retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances.

[78] The appeal is dismissed.",0.3877551020408163,0.26528258362168394,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act.

A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed.

8_2015skqb144.txt,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The Court ordered interim shared custody of the parties. The parties had been together for four years. The petitioner had previously filed an Answer and Counter-Petition in 2012 contesting the respondent’s claims for sole custody, specified and supervised parenting time, and costs. The respondent had previously been granted interim shared parenting time. The Court found that the parties had not spoken since the parties separated. The court ordered the parties to proceed to an expedited pre-trial conference. The judge ordered the parents to have Z. on a shared week-on-week basis. The mother had moved out of the home and was now living with the petitioner. The father had been receiving Worker’S Compensation benefits and top-up from SaskTel. The wife had moved in with the husband. The husband had been living with his mother for several months. The two parties had reconciled in December 2012. The child had been in the mother’ s house for a few days. The relationship had been going on for some time. HELD: 1)The Court found the parties were not in a relationship. The children had been separated for four months. 2)The parties had a provisional agreement that the child would be in the interim care of the mother. The parents would have access to the mother when the trial could be held. 3)The court found that there was no evidence that the father had physically harmed the child. The evidence did not support the petitioner’d claim. The fact that the mother had physically restrained the child from the father was not sufficient evidence to justify the claim. 4)The evidence did support the parties’ contention that the respondent had physically assaulted the child and that the petitioner had been unable to contact the father. The agreement was not binding on the parties as the child was not a party animal. The only evidence that could be found was that the husband had physically abused the child for several days prior to the birth of the child, and that he had physically threatened the petitioner and her mother.","I will now go through the factors set out in s. 8 of the Act. I find that despite what Mr. S. states, she was the primary parent of Z. since birth and continues to be so. Indeed I learned more (although not much) from his mother’s evidence as to the day-to-day activities. I am left with a degree of uncertainty. I accept that the child expresses these words. The child is in need of a stable, reassuring and positive home. I find that it is best provided in the mother’s home. I am concerned that Z.’s emotional needs have been adversely affected by the conduct of Mr. S. A lessening of Mr. S.’s time with Z. may ameliorate this. [145] Accordingly I am persuaded that Z. is afforded far more social fulfillment when in his mother’s care. I find that this adversely reflects upon Mr. S.’s ability to parent. [165] Therefore after carefully considering all of the above, I am of the view the following orders are in the child’s best interests, and I so order: (a) The petitioner, M.D.J., shall have sole custody of the child Z., born in June 2010, with his primary residence to be with the said petitioner. (b) The respondent, C.W.S., shall have alternate weekend access with the said child from Friday at 6:00 p.m. to Sunday at 6:00 p.m. to be extended to Monday at 6:00 p.m. in the event Monday is a school holiday. Therefore I accept the respondent’s argument and will add back into her income $5,000, which I consider to be fair. [170] I am satisfied that Z.’s s. 7 expenses for health, dental, activities and pre-school are about $5,061.35 per year (see P-28, tab 19 in P-8). I do not find the evidence supports an “extraordinary circumstance” as per s. 22(1)(a) of The Family Property Act (see Phillips v Phillips, 2010 SKCA 117 (CanLII), 362 Sask R 124). [186] Accordingly I accept that the exempt amount of the rental properties is $90,641.43 (i.e. $506,000 - $415,358.57). The result is that the respondent (petitioner by counter-petition) has failed to prove that he is entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act, and I dismiss his counter-petition in this regard. (1) Ms. J. shall have sole custody of Z., with Z.’s primary residence to be with Ms. J. and Mr. S. to receive parenting time as set out above; (4) Mr. S.’s claim for spousal support is dismissed; (5) Mr. S.’s claim under The Family Property Act is dismissed without any distribution to either party;",0.34474327628361856,0.4358407079646018,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons.

The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The Court ordered interim shared custody of the parties. The parties had been in a relationship for three years. The petitioner brought an action against the respondent for sole custody, specified and supervised parenting time, and costs. The respondent counter-petitioned, claiming division of property under The Children’s Law Act, 1997, C-8.2 [Act], joint custody of Z., specified parenting time for the respondent, restraining order against the petitioner and costs; the petitioner argued that the parties had not spoken since the separation and that they should have separated. The court ordered the parties to proceed to an expedited pre-trial conference and ordered the parents to have Z. on a shared week-on/week-off basis until trial could be held.","I will now go through the factors set out in s. 8 of the Act. I find that despite what Mr. S. states, she was the primary parent of Z. since birth and continues to be so. Indeed I learned more (although not much) from his mother’s evidence as to the day-to-day activities. I am left with a degree of uncertainty. I accept that the child expresses these words. The child is in need of a stable, reassuring and positive home. I find that it is best provided in the mother’s home. I am concerned that Z.’s emotional needs have been adversely affected by the conduct of Mr. S. A lessening of Mr. S.’s time with Z. may ameliorate this. [145] Accordingly I am persuaded that Z. is afforded far more social fulfillment when in his mother’s care. I find that this adversely reflects upon Mr. S.’s ability to parent. [165] Therefore after carefully considering all of the above, I am of the view the following orders are in the child’s best interests, and I so order: (a) The petitioner, M.D.J., shall have sole custody of the child Z., born in June 2010, with his primary residence to be with the said petitioner. (b) The respondent, C.W.S., shall have alternate weekend access with the said child from Friday at 6:00 p.m. to Sunday at 6:00 p.m. to be extended to Monday at 6:00 p.m. in the event Monday is a school holiday. Therefore I accept the respondent’s argument and will add back into her income $5,000, which I consider to be fair. [170] I am satisfied that Z.’s s. 7 expenses for health, dental, activities and pre-school are about $5,061.35 per year (see P-28, tab 19 in P-8). I do not find the evidence supports an “extraordinary circumstance” as per s. 22(1)(a) of The Family Property Act (see Phillips v Phillips, 2010 SKCA 117 (CanLII), 362 Sask R 124). [186] Accordingly I accept that the exempt amount of the rental properties is $90,641.43 (i.e. $506,000 - $415,358.57). The result is that the respondent (petitioner by counter-petition) has failed to prove that he is entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act, and I dismiss his counter-petition in this regard. (1) Ms. J. shall have sole custody of Z., with Z.’s primary residence to be with Ms. J. and Mr. S. to receive parenting time as set out above; (4) Mr. S.’s claim for spousal support is dismissed; (5) Mr. S.’s claim under The Family Property Act is dismissed without any distribution to either party;",0.24108658743633274,0.22814814814814818,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons.

b_2010nssc125.txt,"The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","The plaintiff was charged with dangerous driving causing death. Following the laying of criminal charges, the plaintiff's employer suspended him from work without pay. The plaintiff offered to use his legal counsel to defend him in relation to the criminal charges. The defendant refused and the plaintiff brought an expert's report. The expert's evidence was so favourable that it was not necessary to object to the admission of the still photographs. The court found that the expert's opinion was so accurate as to be of no relevance to the plaintiff’s case that it should have been admitted into evidence. The Court found that while the video re-enactment was a very good example of how the accident could have gone, it was also not a very convincing example of the Crown’ s flawed theory. The video evidence was not admissible and the court found the expert’d opinion was not supported by the evidence.","[1] This is an action for negligence and breach of contract brought by the Plaintiff, Charles Benjamin Meister, against the Defendant, Michael Vaughan Coyle. [44] I conclude from the above authorities that the standard of care owed by a lawyer to his client is that of the reasonably competent lawyer – no more – no less. I am satisfied that the matter was not as clear cut as it now appears with the benefit of hindsight and the Court of Appeal’s decision.

While it is clear that the plaintiff and defendant were in a relationship that created a duty of care, I find that because the defendant was acting on the advice of counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff that she has not breached the standard of care. CONCLUSION [31] The plaintiff’s claim is dismissed.",0.6111111111111112,0.5191740412979351,"The plaintiff alleges the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and has caused the plaintiff humiliation and distress, through her actions as Reeve of the Council of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood. The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions. The plaintiff is a councillor. The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act. There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council. The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council. The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the parties is a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. 2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful. This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care. Her actions were not negligent.","The plaintiff alleges the defendant has injured his reputation and caused the plaintiff humiliation and distress through her actions as Reeve of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood.

HELD: The plaintiff is not liable to the plaintiff pursuant to the tort of misfeasance in public office. 1)Even if the defendant's decision did infringe the plaintiff's right to expression to some extent and could not be upheld pursuant to s. 45(1) of the R.M. Act, the requirement has not been met. 2)The plaintiff was acting on advice of legal counsel to the municipality and in fact once the meeting was completed, all further written communications to the defendant from the defendant were from legal counsel. There was no evidence that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice. 3)The dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant is a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. The dispute is best dealt with at municipal election.","CLAIM [1] The plaintiff alleges the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and has caused the plaintiff humiliation and distress, through her actions as Reeve of the Council of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood. [24] However, even if the defendant’s decision did infringe the plaintiff’s right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the sections of The Rural Municipality Act, 1989, relied upon in the R.M.’s legal opinion in the letter to the plaintiff August 11, 2005, and I make no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is correct, I am not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to section 24(1) of the Charter for the following reasons. While her decision may have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because (1) the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, (2) there could be a “perceived conflict of interest” in the eyes of MuniCode and ratepayers in the R.M. in the plaintiff’s tendering motion of January 13, 2005, and (3) the Reeve did have some evidence before her that he had misrepresented the situation to council.

What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006.

His report and evidence is that Shawn suffered a posterior dislocation of his right hip, a compound injury involving his right knee with a disruption of the medial collateral ligament and a fracture of his third right metacarpal in the right hand. This is not a case where evidence has been adduced showing a history of income and the interference in that income capacity due to the injuries. There is no evidence of Shawn\'s projected income from the family business and I appreciate the difficulties in adducing such evidence. I am satisfied that by reason of his hip injury his employment opportunities are less than they were before the accident and in that sense he has suffered a loss of a wider employment horizon. He has suffered a reduction in his capital asset and in the breadth of his employment opportunities and he is entitled to be compensated therefore. I consider the only appropriate way to compensate him is to award a lump sum for this loss which is separate and apart from the non‑pecuniary damage.

d_1995canlii4259.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","The appellant band council applied to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owing under a construction contract entered into by the respondent Band with the respondent for the construction of residential homes on the reserve. The appellant claimed under s. 89(1) of the Indian Act that assignments of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the wording of s.89(1). The appellant argued that s. 88(1)(b) of The Indian Act was applicable and governed the issue he was required to consider. The appeal court held that s89(2) of s89.1 of the Act was not inconsistent with the provisions of s27(2). The appeal judge also held that the appellant had not shown that the assignment pre-dated the notifying assignee but who failed to give notice to the subsequent assignee. The respondent Band Council claimed under a different s. 87(1(d) of S.89.2 of the act that assignments made by the appellant to entities other than the Indian Band were invalid by reasons of s87(1), since it related to procedure only. The applicant Band sought to have the money transferred to the respondent Bank by way of a bank draft payable to the Band in trust. The court held the appellant Band could not effectively transfer an interest in the amount owing to the appellant Bank as there was nothing left upon which the assignment to the bank could operate. The Court held that if the appellant bank had priority over the other bank's bank creditors, it would have priority over its own bank. The application for the sum of $70,000 was dismissed with costs. The Appeal Court held the respondent bank should have priority against the assignment of book debt to the applicant Band. The Act does not expressly or impliedly confer any greater right upon an assignee of chose in action that he had before. The act is intended to prevent an Indian from entering into normal financing agreements in conjunction with the operation of a commercial business. The sum of the $101,636.33 owing by the applicant band to the plaintiff was the property of an Indian on a reserve. It was also held the applicant bank should be entitled to a percentage of the amount due to the Indian on the Reserve. The judge concluded that assignments were included in the wording s.87(2)(b). The application was dismissed. The appeals court held:","THE COURT: Appeal allowed per reasons for judgment of Hallett, J.A.; Bateman and Flinn, JJ.A. concurring.

The accused had obtained a warrant to search for blood samples from the Justice of the Peace on January 10, 2009. The warrant specified that the blood samples were authorized to be taken between the hours of 1:22 o’clock a.m. and 5:22 am. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. The Court held that the information contained in the Information to Obtain did not constitute reasonable grounds for the belief that the accused had committed an offence under s.253 and that the Certificate of Analyst and the report from the analyst dated April 20, 2010, should be admitted into evidence at trial. 1)The accused had not deposed that he believed the driver of any motor vehicle, let alone the driver, was the sole occupant of the vehicle, was unconscious with his feet located in the driver's leg/foot area and the rest of his body slumped across the passenger's seat. 2)The Court found that the Warrant to Search for Blood was invalid. 3)There was a breach of the accused’s s. 8 rights. 4)Section 24 of the Charter states that the burden of proof rests upon the accused to establish on a balance of probabilities that the warrant to seize his blood samples was invalid and that evidence heard on the voir dire could be applied to the trial proper.","[1] A trial took place before me regarding Curtis Russell Francis who is charged that on or about the 10th day of January A.D. 2009, at or near Regina, Saskatchewan, he did:

1. While his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drug operate a motor vehicle contrary to sections 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. I found that it did not and as a result there was a breach of the accused’s rights under s. 8 of the Charter to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. I then conducted an analysis pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter respecting the violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. I determined that the Certificate of Analyst and the report from the analyst dated April 20, 2010, should be admitted into evidence at trial. He did not depose that he believed that Mr. Francis was the driver of any motor vehicle, let alone the driver of the Tempo motor vehicle which was registered in his name and which crashed into a light standard around 1:19 a.m. on January 10, 2009. [35] I am of the view that the information which Constable Strueby deposed in the Information to Obtain, when reviewed as a whole, did not constitute reasonable grounds for the belief that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253. Accordingly, I hold that the Warrant to Search for Blood was invalid. [53] While I have found that the blood warrant was invalid and that the seizure of blood samples from Mr. Francis breached his s. 8 right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, I am of the view that Constable Strueby was nonetheless acting in good faith when he obtained blood samples from Mr. Francis. While I have found the Information to Obtain in support of the blood warrant deficient, I am confident that Constable Strueby honestly held the belief that Mr. Francis was drinking and driving and was acting in good faith throughout the early morning of January 10, 2009. [56] With respect to this avenue of inquiry, I am of the view that the breach of Mr. Francis’ s. 8 Charter right was done in good faith and did not seriously undermine the interests protected by the accused. [70] The issue at trial is whether the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused, Curtis Francis was the driver of the Tempo motor vehicle or alternatively was in care and control of the motor vehicle. [71] I am of the view that the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Curtis Francis was the driver of the Tempo vehicle which collided with the power pole on 6th Avenue at 1:19 a.m. on January 10, 2009. However, when their evidence is examined as a whole I am sure that Mr. Francis was driving his Tempo vehicle when it collided with the power pole. [78] As I have determined that the accused was the operator of a motor vehicle at 1:19 a.m. on January 10, 2009, with a blood alcohol concentration of between 236 mg% and 283 mg%, I find him to be guilty of count number two.",0.5172413793103449,0.5208053691275168,"The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while over.08 contrary to s. 253 of the Criminal Code and s. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Code. The accused had obtained a warrant to search for blood samples from the Justice of the Peace on January 10, 2009. The warrant specified that the blood samples were authorized to be taken between the hours of 1:22 o’clock a.m. and 5:22 am. The Court reviewed the whole of the material presented and determined that the Certificate of Analyst and the report from the analyst were not sufficient grounds for the accused’s belief that the accused was the driver of the vehicle. HELD: The Warrant to Search for Blood was invalid. 1)The accused did not depose that he believed that the driver was the sole occupant of the motor vehicle, was unconscious, with his feet located in the driver's leg/foot area and his body slumped across the passenger seat. 2)The information was not sufficient to establish that the warrant was invalid and there was a breach of his s. 8 rights. 3)The officer who swore the information to Obtain did not provide sufficient detail to permit the justice of the peace to determine that reasonable grounds exist for the warrant to issue. 4)The Certificate of Analysis was not deposed that he thought that the person who had been driving the vehicle at the time of the accident (the driver) was in care and control of it. The officer who testified during the voir dire was not required to provide his reasonable grounds for belief. 5)The Court reviewed all of the evidence before it and concluded that the information contained in the Information was not supported by sufficient grounds in support of the warrant.  6)Section 24(2)of the Charter states that the burden of proof rests upon the accused to establish on a balance of probabilities that the search warrant is invalid and that there was an infringement of his rights as guaranteed by s. 16 of the Charter. The information heard on the voire dire of the officer who signed the information could be applied to the trial proper. 7)Section 8(2)(b) is a technical error and is not fatal to the warrant, but rather than being a prerequisite to review, their sole impact is to determine whether there is any basis for the decision of the authorizing judge. The taking of the blood sample from the accused constituted a warrantless search. 8)",0.5951859956236324

She had been advised that the deceased had suffered a severe aortic aneurysm and that she did not wish to receive benefits within the six month period contemplated in the Workers’ Compensation Act.

The applicant thereupon notified the Board on October 14, 2001 that she wished to appeal the September 18, 2001 denial of her claim, and on October 29, 2001, the Board issued a formal written decision, denying Gloria Truitt’s appeal because “Mr. Truitt was not found dead at his place of employment on March 2, 1998.” Based upon the foregoing application of Sections 45 and 47, or in the alternative Section 30, the appeal is denied. The appeal should be accepted. Accordingly, I am of the view that the Board did act outside its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the applicant’s deceased spouse was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of the Act. The majority decision in Henry v. Saskatchewan (Workers’ Compensation Board), supra, clearly precludes approaching an analysis of s. 30 as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption.

The appeal is denied. [46] I am of the view, for the foregoing reasons, that the Board has waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim.

7_2015skqb352.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – Best Interests of ChildFamily Law – Custody and Access – Interim – VariationFamily Law – DivorceFamily Law – Evidence – AffidavitThe parties were in a high-conflict situation and brought five interim applications with various requests. They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.",HELD: The Court granted the application. The Court ordered that the child be registered in the Montessori program and that the cost of the program be paid at the time of trial. The court found no reason for the denial of the divorce. The child was already in the preschool program and was now attending preschool. The mother had hired a full-time nanny and the child was now enrolled in the program. The parties had been separated for 1 year. The father had made significant contributions to the child's education and the mother was of the opinion that the children would benefit from having access to the Montesessori school. The issue of increasing parenting time was brought by the father and was not a new matter brought by him. The order was made to allow the parties to proceed with the child registration. The cost of that program was to be paid by the petitioner.,"The parts of the various applications are as follows:
1. Application for Divorce – brought by the petitioner;
2. To register the child, Jude Babich, in a Montessori School – brought by the petitioner;
3. To take the child, Jude Babich, to a speech therapist – brought by the petitioner;
4. To vary the existing parenting arrangements set forth in the decision of Megaw J. dated January 20, 2015 – brought by the petitioner;
5. To set the arrears of child and spousal support – brought by the respondent;
6. To return the 2005 Volkswagen Beetle vehicle – brought by the respondent;
7. Objections to the petitioner’s affidavit of September 28, 2015 – brought by the respondent;
8. Objections to the petitioner’s affidavit of October 16, 2015 – brought by the respondent. [24] In the circumstances before me, I can see no reason for the denial of the divorce at this stage. Accordingly, the judgment for divorce is granted. 2. To register the child, Jude Babich, in a Montessori School – brought by the petitioner. On the basis of the evidence before me, it is therefore appropriate Jude now be enrolled in the Montessori program. [31] Accordingly, I order Jude may be registered in the Montessori program by the petitioner and begin attending as soon as the program is able to accommodate such attendance. The cost of that program shall be paid, at this stage, by the petitioner. 3. To take the child, Jude Babich, to a speech therapist – brought by the petitioner. 4.

They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","HELD: The Court granted the application and ordered that the matter of increasing parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue, even an expedited pre- trial conference. The Court found no reason for the denial of the divorce at this stage. 1)The parties were separated for in excess of one year. The petitioner sought to have the child registered in the Montessori program by the petitioner and begin attending as soon as the program was able to accommodate such attendance. The respondent opposed the petitioner having an increased parenting time. 2)The Court found that the Court must accept its jurisdictional responsibility to deal with parenting arrangements as they arise. 3)The court found that in the event the respondent was unable to transport the child to his or her classes, the court would grant the judgment for divorce.

S.100 requires a conviction on an indictable offence involving violence against a person where the maximum sentence available is 10 years imprisonment or more. 3)The maximum sentence for assault under S.266 is 5 years if the Crown proceeds by indictment and 6 months if, as here, the Crown proceeds summarily.","The accused was convicted of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to a term of 6 months imprisonment and to enter into a probation order for a term 18 months on certain specific conditions. A ten-year firearm, ammunition and explosive substance prohibition order was made against the appellant pursuant to s100(1) of the Code. The accused appealed the sentence and reduced the term of imprisonment imposed at trial from 6 months to ""time served"" and maintained the 18 month probation order subject only to amending the time within which the appellant was to report to the chief probation officer as required by s. 100(1).

the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan sentenced the accused to
serve a term of six months\' imprisonment and to enter into a
probation order for a term of 18 months on certain specific
conditions. As well, a ten-year firearm, ammunition and
explosive substance prohibition order was made against the
appellant pursuant to the provisions of s. 100(1) of the
Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. This is an appeal against (1) said six-month term
of imprisonment and (2) said s. 100(1) prohibition order. In these circumstances, having regard for the
applicable sentencing principles of protection of society,
punishment, general and specific deterrence, reformation and
rehabilitation, and the need to maintain the public\'s
confidence in the administration of justice, and, after
applying thereto the various applicable factors as discussed
by and with both counsel during the hearing of this appeal, I
allowed the appeal against sentence and reduced the term
imposed at trial from six months\' imprisonment to ""time
served"" and maintained the 18 month probation order (against
which no appeal was taken) subject only to amending the time
within which the appellant was to report to the chief
probation officer as therein provided. As earlier observed the appellant was charged and
on his plea of guilty thereto was convicted of an offence
contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code which provides as
follows:

266. Every one who commits an assault is
guilty of

(a) an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding five
years; or

(b) an offence punishable on summary

The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home. Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity. The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","HELD: The Court granted the divorce in accordance with s. 8(1)(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. It deferred the issue of custody and access while they attempted to work out transitional issues with Doctor Landry. The parties had entered into a Separation Agreement in June 2004. The agreement purported to settle all matters between the parties and was to be incorporated into and form part of the Corollary Relief Judgement in this matter. The petitioner claimed 10 percent of his household expenditures at his tax deductions, using his house to do his administrative work, and using his savings to pay child support, spousal support and costs with division of property. The father argued that the particulars of the agreement did not and do not reflect his net business income derived from self employment. HELD: 1) The Court found that the parties had reached an agreement that reflected their true financial circumstances and valid agreement. 2) The court found that it was unfair in that it did not ensure that the father was fully protected by overtly addressing mobility. 3) There was no evidence of undue influence, fraud or evidence that would affect the parties ability to retain and instruct counsel. 4) There were significant changes in the circumstances of the parties.",[3] He seeks a variation of the provisions regarding child support and spousal support.

e_2004skpc82.txt,"The accused youth is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions. However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The evidence of impairment was not supported by the evidence of the accused's prior driving. 2)The accused did not display any symptoms of impairment. The officer noted that the accused was visiting with his friends and as soon as he was aware of the emergency lights, he began to slow and pull over to the shoulder, being required to do so safely because he had just passed the vehicle. 3)The court found that in the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for these tests, the proper method of application, and to comment on their relative reliability, it was not appropriate for the court to rely upon them on the issue of guilt or innocence, to the prejudice of the defendant. 4)The Court found that the evidence did not support the accused’s impairment beyond the reasonable doubt and that the suggestion that he was moving slowly was not a credible indicator of impairment and will not be given undue weight for that purpose. 5)The test results were inconclusive. The accused did have a reasonable amount of difficulty with balance and coordination. The evidence of his lack of coordination and inability to perform physical tests was not considered a reliable indicator of impaired driving. The test results did not indicate impairment. 6)The officer noted the accused had a very strong smell of alcohol in the vehicle and that he had been drinking beer with his lunch. The police were called to the scene and the accused indicated that he did not remember seeing the previous day during the party nor that he noticed the smell of marijuana. The court concluded that in absence of an expert evidence, the court was not able to decide whether the accused would be guilty or innocent. 7)The only evidence of impaired operation was the alcohol consumption. The Court found the accused did display slurred speech. The defendant appeared to fully comprehend his legal rights and obligations in his communications with the peace officer, peace officer and legal aid duty counsel. The opportunity to make the observations was only during roughly two minutes. The Crown did not show any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. The defence did not demonstrate any mental or physical impairment.","[1] The accused youth is charged that on April 27, 2002, near Dundurn Saskatchewan, he did operate a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug, contrary to Section 253(a) of the Criminal Code.

At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person.

The police stopped the car and found a hand gun under the seat and with stolen property. The accused was found in the car with the driver and two young men in the vehicle. The Crown argued that the accused was simply confused and not able to identify the people involved. The defence argued that because the accused clearly saw the people who robbed him, that the circumstances in which the accused saw the person who had been robbed were more than suspicious. The circumstances in the circumstances were more concerning than the police finding the accused in the courtroom. The court found that the person in the accused's car who had pleaded guilty to the robbery and who fit the general description of one of the robbers was the accused. The evidence from the Crown argued the accused had not been in the court room when the police stopped him and that the two young people in the driver's car had left the location of the robbery. The Court also argued that there was a strong circumstantial evidence that the Crown could have identified the accused with the help of the police. The circumstantials did not support the conclusion that the court could have concluded that the victim had not seen the people he described. The fact that the police found the accused sitting on the bench was more than enough to conclude that the crime was committed by the accused and that he had not simply been picked up by the police but had been picked-up by the other two young males. The trial judge concluded that there were no reasonable grounds to conclude the accused could have been identified with the assistance of the Crown. The only conclusion that could be drawn was that the evidence from both the Crown and the defence was circumstantially inconsistent. The first inference was that because of the circumstances the accused did not see the people in his car that he was not able or willing to identify them. The second inference was based on the fact that he clearly saw his assailants when the Police stopped it in high risk take down and that their identities would be determined. The third inference was also based on his failure to identify himself. The facts were not in dispute. The crime was not committed by him. The two young guys who were in the defendant's car when the robbery was committed were the only people who were there when the others were picked up in at some building, somewhere in Fairview.

7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","The defendant appealed his conviction on a charge of unlawfully harvesting forest products and unlawfully possessing forest products. He argued the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the wood he sold to an undercover officer was wood harvested from Crown lands. The Crown appealed the sentence imposed on the conviction of unlawfully trafficking in forest products, arguing the fine was unreasonable or insufficiently low and that the evidence established that the accused had unlawfully harvested wood from Crown land. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The evidence of the conservation officers was uncontradicted. 2)The Crown appealed. 3)The Court of Queen's Bench found that a fine of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge was an unreasonably low penalty for the offence the evidence establishes. 4)The acquittals on the charges of unlawfully harvested and unlawfully possessed forest products have not been appealed. 5)The trial judge must show great deference in reviewing the decisions of trial judges, interfering to vary sentence only if the sentence is clearly unreasonable or demonstrably unfit.","[1] This case involves an appeal by the defendant from his conviction and by the Crown as regards the sentence imposed on Wayne Gitzel on a charge of unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act, S.S. 1996, c. F-19.1. [3] For its part, the Crown has appealed the sentence imposed taking the position that a fine of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge was an unreasonably low penalty for the offence the evidence established. [4] The charges against Wayne Gitzel are that between November 27, 2007 and December 22, 2009, at or near the communities of Holbein and Shellbrook in the Province of Saskatchewan he:

i) unlawfully harvested forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act;
ii) unlawfully possessed forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) of The Forest Resources Management Act; and
iii) unlawfully trafficked in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act. [16] The trial judge held that, after considering all of the evidence, he was not satisfied that during the period in the indictment, the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the actus reus on Count No. 1 of unlawfully harvesting forest products, nor Count No. 2 of unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence. He found that the Crown had proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, the actus reus on Count No. 3 of unlawfully trafficking in forest products, but he held that given the defendant’s own words to the undercover operator, he was not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, the defendant was duly diligent to ensure that the wood he sold to the undercover operator and the previous sales (presumably referring to the previous 150 truckloads and the 58 truckloads he told Clarke he sold in 2008 and 2009) was wood coming from private lands. With all due respect to the learned trial judge, I find this conclusion and reasoning to be in error. The defendant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act as charged. Therefore, the conviction stands. Accordingly, a fine equivalent to a levy avoided would be inappropriately low since the fine could not in those circumstances act as a deterrent to either the defendant or other offenders. [41] Factoring in that the defendant was in the offence he committed intending to avoid a charge or levy of $1,500, recognizing the deal that he was making did not conclude and thus he did not actually generate revenue from the proposed transaction and considering the need for a significant deterrent to the defendant and other offenders who are committing this offence on a commercial scale, I have concluded that in the circumstances of this case an appropriate fine is $5,000. Accordingly, the defendant shall pay a fine of $5,000. The defendant shall also pay a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations, 1997, R.R.S. c. V-6.011 Reg. 1. The defendant shall have 60 days to pay the fine and victim surcharge imposed, and in default of payment shall serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.",0.36553524804177545,0.3356481481481482,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act.

Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","The defendant appealed his conviction on a charge of unlawfully harvesting forest products and unlawfully possessing forest products.

F-19.1. [3] For its part, the Crown has appealed the sentence imposed taking the position that a fine of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge was an unreasonably low penalty for the offence the evidence established. [4] The charges against Wayne Gitzel are that between November 27, 2007 and December 22, 2009, at or near the communities of Holbein and Shellbrook in the Province of Saskatchewan he:

i) unlawfully harvested forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act;
ii) unlawfully possessed forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) of The Forest Resources Management Act; and
iii) unlawfully trafficked in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act. [16] The trial judge held that, after considering all of the evidence, he was not satisfied that during the period in the indictment, the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the actus reus on Count No. 1 of unlawfully harvesting forest products, nor Count No. 2 of unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence. He found that the Crown had proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, the actus reus on Count No. 3 of unlawfully trafficking in forest products, but he held that given the defendant’s own words to the undercover operator, he was not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, the defendant was duly diligent to ensure that the wood he sold to the undercover operator and the previous sales (presumably referring to the previous 150 truckloads and the 58 truckloads he told Clarke he sold in 2008 and 2009) was wood coming from private lands. With all due respect to the learned trial judge, I find this conclusion and reasoning to be in error. The defendant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act as charged.

He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer.

The word should generally not be implied where it is inconsistent with the express terms of the contract. The court does not have licence to reconstruct a contract on equitable principles, or from the point of view of what the parties should reasonably have contemplated. 3)With the greatest of respect to the position advanced by HAL, a term permitting a appeal from an arbitrators' decision on a question of law does not form part of a 'final and binding' agreement. Such a term is certainly not akin to an 'implicit term' in the nature of the case. Such An implied term cannot be found, and if there is a contrary intention on the part of either party, the application must be dismissed. 4)The court does have a duty to reconstruct contract on an equitable principles. It has a duty not to infer from the evidence that the parties intended to appeal. 5)The provisions of the IDSL, SCA and ESMA exclude the right of appeal on questions of law, pursuant to s. 45(2) of the Act.

2_2011nssc486.txt,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.",The parties were in a shared parenting arrangement. The mother sought joint custody and primary care with the father. The father was to pay a proportionally greater share of the child support. The parties had lived together for a very short period of time. The Father had been paying a significant portion of the father's pension benefits. The Mother had been frustrated and frustrated with the Father. The evidence suggested that the father had not always been as respectful of the mother as he should have been. The information provided by the Father and his witnesses in respect to the serious and damaging allegations against the father was credible. The court found that the information provided was credible and the information was not inconsistent with the mother's evidence. The Court ordered that final decisions about the children's regular health and dental care shall be in the mother’s authority.,"I have decided that the information provided by the Father and his witnesses, is credible.

It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the Court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial, calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The Court held that the Charter right was at stake and that the accused was entitled to exercise his or her right to a fair and impartial trial. The Court reviewed the authorities which have been filed by the Crown. It concluded that the fairness of these proceedings was enhanced by the fact that the court had not created a structured procedure for Charter applications in Provincial Court trials.","1.

It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years.

The mother had the use of his father's truck for the s. 7 expenses until further order and for as long as Michael and Jessica remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act.

The court ordered that the mother produce receipts for reimbursement from the father. 3) The parties were unable to speak with one another. 4) The mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward. The Court found that s.9 does not provide a presumption in favour of Table support nor does it provide a strong presumption in favor of the proposition that a parent who exercises access more than 40% will have his or her child support obligation decreased. The onus is on the parent wishing to invoke the operation of s. to demonstrate to the court's satisfaction that shared custody arrangement as contemplated by s. is in place, and has been, or will be in place over the course of year.

The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath.

The appeal was allowed on the basis that the appeal was not excluded. 4)The judge was not in a position to decide on the issue of whether the accused's s. 10(b) right to appeal should be excluded. 5)The court reviewed several recent appellate court decisions as to when the results of roadside sobriety tests can be used for the purpose of proving an offence or for challenging the credibility of an accused.","[1] This is a summary conviction appeal from a judgment dated September 17, 2010, wherein the learned Provincial Court judge convicted the appellant of impaired care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, fined him $1,000.00 and prohibited him from driving for one year. In the same judgment, the learned trial judge acquitted the appellant of a second charge of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit of .08 contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. [6] There are three issues on this appeal which I will discuss in the order they were raised by counsel in argument: 3. Does the conviction for impaired operation of a motor vehicle constitute an unsafe verdict? 3. Does the conviction for impaired operation of a motor vehicle constitute an unsafe verdict?

The trial judge was in a special position on matters of credibility by being able to observe the witness at the time of testimony and compare his observations to the testimony of other witnesses. 2)The appellant did not resort to conjecture or speculation as suggested by the counsel for the appellant. The learned trial judge reviewed the police officer's evidence and found that there was nothing in the record to indicate there was any inherent improbability in his evidence or any other basis which would justify interference by an appellate court with the findings of the trial judge. 3)The appeal court concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt sufficient evidence of impairment to meet the standard set out in the Stellato decision.",0.4619970193740685

5_2006nsca41.txt,"The plaintiff company commenced an action against a former employee/shareholder for breach of fiduciary and employee duty. The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company. The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action. The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","The appellants sought leave to appeal the order permitting the application of the judge to withdraw the admissions and to add a claim for an 'oppression remedy' to the counterclaim for alleged misdeeds of the appellant. The appellant appealed. The appellants argued that the judge erred in allowing the appellant to amend his defence to withdraw certain admissions he made in his defence. The judge allowed the application to withdraw and to include a claim to an 'acquisition remedy' for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. The parties also argued that a judge erring in his discretion in permitting the appellant's application to add the claim for a 'defensive remedy' and not his rights as a former shareholder. Dismissing the appeal, that the court found that the appellants had not erred by applying the less restrictive test approved in Abacus. The court found no temporal connection between the appellant’s and the impugned acts of oppression and that the order spoke prospectively not retroactively.","Held: Leave to appeal granted, but appeal dismissed, as per reasons for judgment of Hamilton, J.A.; Mr. Bunnell and the Company appeal the order permitting these alterations to the pleadings.

The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed.

HELD: The application was allowed. 1)The mother's reasons for moving to Ontario were not unreasonable if the course he wished to take was not offered at the Dental College of the University of Saskatchewan. 2)The father had not filed any medical certificate about his condition nor had he in his affidavit said whether the course was available in the province. 3)The court did not form the opinion that his move was to thwart his ex-wife's access, since there does not seem to be any dispute about this since 1990, and indeed friends and neighbours filed affidavits stating how much the boys enjoyed their visits with their mother and how they fitted in with the people of that town and environs. 4)The evidence showed that the father had, together of course, with his present wife, the day to day care of the children from their early years onward, except when they were exercising the access.",0.5046296296296297
e_2013skca1.txt,"The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence.

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The Chambers judge did not err in his decision to err in relying upon the lawyer's affidavit. The facts, coupled with case law stating a lawyer may owe a duty of caring to a non- client and the evidence of the Respondent's lawyer, did not establish a common issue which met the commonality requirements of the Class Actions Act. 2)The respondent's affidavits were made available to potential investors by Royal Crown. The Chambers judge reviewed the affidavits of the representative and found that the lawyer may have owed a duty to a client in specific circumstances, including those akin to those before him. The evidence of clients using legal opinions provided by their legal counsel as a marketing tool is so common among tax lawyers that the Chambers judge should have taken appropriate steps to guard against their opinion letters being inappropriately used for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with the client or clients. 3)The chambers judge did err in not applying the Rule 173(c) analysis when determining whether the relationship with the representative was insufficient and not a commonality issue.

HELD: The proposed appeal was granted or withheld in the amount of $23,000. 1)The facts, coupled with case law stating a lawyer may owe a duty or care to a non- client and the evidence of Mr. Davies establish a common issue which appears to meet the requirements of the Class Actions Act. 2)Nothing in the Chambers judge's reasons suggests he applied a rules-based analysis when determining whether'some basis in fact' supported the existence of a recognized 'duty of care' within the meaning of s. 6(1)(c) of the Act. 3)No common issue existed upon which the class action could reasonably be certified. 4)The Chambers judge erred in failing to properly apply the Anns test, or to consider policy reasons that may prevent the imposition of duty on them, are essentially aspects of their defence and not reasons to strike the negligence claim at this juncture. 5)The proposed appeal is prima facie destined to fail and not of sufficient merit to warrant the attention of the Court of Appeal.",0.5542168674698795

The s. 7 expenses claimed by the petitioner include dental work of $112.90 for Kristen, orthodontic work for Brina and costs associated with Brina's post-secondary education. It is uncontroverted that Brina has disabilities that necessitate certain tools such as a computer for her to be successful in her post-secondary training. HELD: 1) The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses and there shall be an order accordingly. 2) The September 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in Brina's s. 7 expenses. Accordingly the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s. 7 costs. 2) The crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred on Brina's part and will assist her with her future plans. 3) The Zeller's supplies would normally be covered under the Table support and that expense is disallowed. 4) Brina's s. 7 post-secondary expenses are $7,123.72 and include tuition, crisis prevention class and books, required university books, bus pass, black cartridge for the printer, Shaw internet, Microsoft licence, computer repairs and updated virus protection.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to have arrears fixed with regard to s. expenses related to her daughter's post-secondary education and in addition requests that the amount of ongoing s. 7 expenses be specified. HELD: 1) The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses. The Zellers supplies, however, would normally be covered under Table support. The expense shall be disallowed.  2) It is noted that the September 28, 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in the respondent's s.7 expenses. Accordingly, the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s. 7 costs. The costs relating the computer were legitimate s7 costs and the crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred on the respondent’s part and will assist her in her future plans. The $1,865.94 in student and university fees were calculated as calculated as the s. 8 post-graduate education expenses for the 2005/2006 year. The respondent accepted responsibility for the proportionate portion of the girl’ s. seven expenses. 3) The costs related to the computers were legitimate expenses. 4) The Zellerers supplies would normally cover under Table supports. 5) The $7,123.72 calculated by the respondent was calculated as follows:University of Saskatchewan fall and spring terms, $1.865 per month, $3,002.60 in university fees, $2,002 per month in student loans and $1 million in bus pass fees. The s. costs relating with the computer and the bus pass were legitimate costs incurred on respondent”s part. The crisis prevention classes were a reasonable expenditure incurred on Brina’S part and would assist her future plan. The expenses relating to computer repairs were legitimate supplementary expenses. 6) The cost relating to software were legitimate in nature. The cost of the crisis- prevention class would normally not be covered by Table support and the Zeller supplies would be disallow. 7) The expense was disallowed for the respondent to pay 66% of the s7 post-primary education expenses.","The sole issue now before this Court is the amount to be fixed for the ongoing s. 7 expenses.

c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accused was charged with possession of an unloaded prohibited firearm pursuant to s. 95(1) of the Criminal Code and possession of a loaded prohibited weapon pursuant to a Charter voir dire. The accused was also charged with trafficking firearms. The evidence at trial was that the accused had constructive and/or joint possession of firearms and ammunition at his father's residence. The Crown had provided notice of its intention to seek this amendment at the start of the trial. The defence had refused to grant the amendment. The court found that the evidence at the trial was not consistent with the Crown's position. The Court found that, pursuant to ss. 95 and s. 8 of the Code, the accused could not assert a privacy interest in order to obtain the protection of s.8 of the Charter and then, when that application went badly and the evidence was admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the interest resided. The essential issue on the charges against the accused was whether the accused possessed constructive and or joint possession. HELD: The accused were found guilty of all charges. The facts were that the firearms seized were firearms within the meaning of the criminal code and that they and the two magazines had been correctly identified and classified in the charges.  1)The accused's Charter application in relation to the firearms was not dispensed with. The joint information against the defendants was that they had constructive possession of the loaded Mark II rifle, loaded Cooey sawed-off shotgun, and the loaded AP 9 handgun. 2)The evidence at issue was whether they had joint possession or possession of any of the firearms at the accused's residence as a result of the Part VI authorized intercepts. The fact that the guns were found in the accused’s home and in the defendant’ s residence was irrelevant. 3)The essential issue was that, as the accused knew about and/ or had some control over the guns located at his dad’d residence, the intercepts were of pivotal importance to the firearm trafficking charges. 4)The Court found no evidence that the contents of the accused were admissible as evidence in this trial.","Also as a result of the Part VI authorized intercepts, on April 29, 2009, Kyle Cater was charged with trafficking firearms. They are: the unlawful storage of a sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun, a Lakefield Mark II rifle, and an AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun, and ammunition, in a careless manner (contrary to Criminal Code section 86(1) x 3), unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun, the Lakefield Mark II rifle and the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun (contrary to Criminal Code section 88(1) x 3), unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited weapon – the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun, and unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited firearm – the sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun (contrary to Criminal Code section 95(1) x 2), unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey and the AP 9 handgun, knowing that possession is unauthorized (contrary to Criminal Code section 92(1) x 2), and unlawful possession of two over capacity magazines, a prohibited device (contrary to Criminal Code section 92(2)). [9] On February 24 at the close of the Crown’s case against Kyle, I granted an amendment to Count #8 of the January 15, 2009 Information to allege, pursuant to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code, unlawful possession by Kyle Cater of an unloaded prohibited firearm - the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun together with readily accessible ammunition that was capable of being discharged in the firearm. [43] I am unable to accept that Kyle Cater can assert a privacy interest in order to obtain the protection of section 8 of the Charter and then, when that application goes badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. [101] I have concluded that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts is that the speakers are talking about guns. He obviously also tried to exercise a measure of control, telling his father to get rid of what was there, to no avail. [168] The “Tracey” calls on December 7 and the January 15 calls indicate that Kyle had much more than merely a passive or quiescent knowledge of the firearms and ammunition at 80 Cavendish. [171] There are a number of indicators of Kyle Cater having a measure of control over the firearms at 80 Cavendish. Accordingly I find him guilty of Counts 4, 5 and 6 of the Information sworn January 15, 2009, unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey shotgun, the Mark II Lakefield rifle, and the AA Arms AP 9 handgun, contrary to section 88(1) of the Criminal Code. I also find him guilty of Count 7, unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited firearm, a sawed off Cooey shotgun, contrary to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code, and of the amended Count 8, unlawful possession of an unloaded prohibited firearm, the AA Arms AP 9 handgun together with readily accessible ammunition capable of being discharged in the firearm, contrary to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code. [179] I further find Kyle Cater guilty of Counts 9 and 10 of unlawfully possessing the Cooey and the AP 9 knowing their possession was unauthorized, contrary to section 92(1) of the Criminal Code. And I find him guilty of Count 11, unlawfully possessing a prohibited device, two over-capacity magazines, contrary to section 92(2) of the Criminal Code. I am acquitting him of those charges. However I am not able to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Kyle had stored the three firearms in the manner they were found on January 15. I infer this from Intercept 7, a conversation on December 2, 2008 with D.M. and from the evidence that establishes Kyle was stashing his guns at locations other than where he was living. I find that the purpose of Kyle’s possession was offering to transfer it, that is, his purpose conforms to the Criminal Code definition of “transfer.” It was a firearms trafficking purpose. [207] My conclusions on the firearms trafficking charges can be summarized as follows: I find the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Kyle Cater is guilty of Counts 3 and 4, relating to the .410 gauge shotgun; Counts 5 and 6, relating to the Derringer; Counts 7 and 8, relating to the .308 calibre rifle; and guilty of possession of the .45 calibre handgun for the purpose of offering to transfer it. [208] I acquit Kyle Cater of Counts 9, 10, 11 and 12 on the firearms trafficking Information. I find Kyle to be guilty of the possession of the .45 calibre firearm on December 28, 2008, a finding I am making in relation to Count 1 of the Information, not as specifically charged under Count 9 of the Information as I find that on or about December 7, 2008, Kyle Cater did not have possession of the .45 calibre handgun he was discussing at that time with I.E.",0.4309210526315789,0.5435073627844712,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking.

HELD: The accused were found guilty of possession of the loaded Mark II rifle, a Lakefield Mark II shotgun, and ammunition in a careless manner and were convicted of trafficking firearms contrary to the s. 84(1)(b) of The Criminal Code. The joint information against the accused and the accused lists eleven charges. The essential issue on the charges against them is whether the accused has constructive and or joint possession with the accused of the guns seized from him at the time of his arrest.  1)The accused have not resorted to the accused's assertion of reasonable expectation of privacy in the Samsung cell phone in determining that the phone is his. 2)The essential issue is whether they have constructive and joint possession. 3)The evidence was not lost on the accused. 4)The defence did not concede continuity. The burden of proof rests on the prosecution throughout the case and never shifts to the defendant. An assessment that an accused is probably guilty is insufficient. Reasonable doubt is based on reason and common sense and is logically connected to the evidence or lack thereof. 5)The court found that the guns and ammunition introduced as evidence in this trial were not the ones located in the accused’s and the other defendants’ homes. They were found in the possession of both the accuseds’ parents. 6)The Court found that although the accused was presumed innocent until the Crown proved he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, it was not satisfied that the evidence was lost on them. 7)The issue of the evidence in relation to the firearms was not dispensed with. The fact that the Crown had obtained Part VI authorization to intercept the private communications of named targets believed to be involved in the drug trade did not exist. 8)The fact that there was no evidence of a breach of any of the warranties in the documents was irrelevant. 9)The only evidence offered by the accused as to the identity of the accused is that they and the two magazines were correctly identified and classified in the charges.  10)","Also as a result of the Part VI authorized intercepts, on April 29, 2009, Kyle Cater was charged with trafficking firearms.

The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities.

They are: the unlawful storage of a sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun, a Lakefield Mark II rifle, and an AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun, and ammunition, in a careless manner (contrary to Criminal Code section 86(1) x 3), unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun, the Lakefield Mark II rifle and the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun (contrary to Criminal Code section 88(1) x 3), unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited weapon – the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun, and unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited firearm – the sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun (contrary to Criminal Code section 95(1) x 2), unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey and the AP 9 handgun, knowing that possession is unauthorized (contrary to Criminal Code section 92(1) x 2), and unlawful possession of two over capacity magazines, a prohibited device (contrary to Criminal Code section 92(2)). [9] On February 24 at the close of the Crown’s case against Kyle, I granted an amendment to Count #8 of the January 15, 2009 Information to allege, pursuant to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code, unlawful possession by Kyle Cater of an unloaded prohibited firearm - the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun together with readily accessible ammunition that was capable of being discharged in the firearm.

The burden of proof rests on the prosecution throughout the case and never shifts to the defendant. An assessment that an accused is probably guilty is insufficient. Reasonable doubt is based on reason and common sense and is logically connected to the evidence or lack thereof. 5)The court found that the guns and ammunition introduced as evidence in this trial were not the ones located in the accused’s and the other defendants’ homes. They were found in the possession of both the accuseds’ parents. 6)The Court found that although the accused was presumed innocent until the Crown proved he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, it was not satisfied that the evidence was lost on them. 7)The issue of the evidence in relation to the firearms was not dispensed with. The fact that the Crown had obtained Part VI authorization to intercept the private communications of named targets believed to be involved in the drug trade did not exist. 8)The fact that there was no evidence of a breach of any of the warranties in the documents was irrelevant. 9)The only evidence offered by the accused as to the identity of the accused is that they and the two magazines were correctly identified and classified in the charges.  10)",0.5171102661596958

e_2005skpc8.txt,"The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic.

He had filed consumer proposal in 2001, which he completed successfully in 2006. He earned $50,874 (gross) per annum; was at the top of his pay scale; had two young children; and his wife worked half-time position at Aliant, earning $16,272 year. There were daycare costs when the wife worked, and the applicant's transportation costs were high (but reasonable). The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards. The applicant did not have any credit either. Their home had little, if any, equity. The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan. Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability. If the application were refused, he would have to consider bankruptcy.","The bankrupt applies for an order under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act that does not question his good faith with respect to the student loan debt.

The debt in effect can either be cancelled or affirmed. No middle ground is available. 2)The bankrupt has a monthly surplus of about $170.

Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling.

The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action.

7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in the proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life is in possession of the surplus totalling approximately $3.5 million plus interest payable since. The insurer claims no interest in the surplus and that the rights to refund of such surpluuses may belong to individual borrowers of Empire Life whose lives were insured over the years under the Policy and whom it views as having paid the premiums resulting in the surplus. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be decided.

6_2003skqb170.txt,"The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity. The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal. Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.","The appellant was convicted of assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. His sentence was suspended with a 1 year probation order and he appealed. During argument on behalf of the appellant, the trial judge suggested that the trial Judge misapplied the test in determining credibility. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the trial was ordered to a new trial. 1)The trial judge failed to properly consider the defence of necessity. The only evidence presented relating to the defence was that the appellant had referred to photographs depicting the extent, location and nature of injuries suffered by the complainant when no photographs existed or if they were never tendered in evidence. 2)The Court was of the opinion that no miscarriage of justice resulted from the trial court's error of law. 3)The evidence presented was immaterial whether there were injuries.

The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department.

The defendant claimed liability for the injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while shopping in a produce department. The plaintiff's affidavit alleged that there was a small amount of water on the floor and she did not receive more treatments due to the fact that only five physiotherapy treatments were covered by the defendant. The evidence of two assistant managers employed at the time of the accident confirmed the water on floor. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded costs. 1)The defendant did not contest the presence of water in the vicinity of where the plaintiff slipped and fall although it did not concede that it was the water which caused the plaintiff to slip. 2)The plaintiff met the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water. 3)The evidence of the defendant employees who had resigned as employees of the company and were not able to attend the trial testified that they had been paid by the company to clean the floor. 4)The court concluded that the defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable for the injury suffered by the plaintiff. 5)The defendants did not dispute the presence or the water in a certain area of the store. The defendants claim the defendant exceeded the legal standards imposed upon them in the event of a slip and fell. The court found otherwise. 6)The plaintiffs claim the defendants met the standard of caring imposed upon the defendant in this case that is inconsistent with that imposed by the Court in the Mollenhauer and Leibel group of cases. 7)The Court concluded that there have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water on a floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger.

Ramsay Drugs Ltd. [1991 CanLII 7734](Q.B.)and Grant v. Westfair Foods Ltd. (1991), which proposed a four part inquiry to determine whether there was a breach of the duty, four parts inquiry were conducted: 1)Was there an 'unusual danger'? 2.If so, did the occupier know or have reason to know about it? 3.Did the defendant use reasonable care to prevent damage from the 'usual danger' 4.","[1] The plaintiff seeks damages for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore in Regina on March 28, 2000. The defendant places in issue:

(a) Whether it is liable to the plaintiff for the injuries she sustained in this slip and fall accident; and

(b) The degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident. The plaintiff's affidavit asserted that on March 28, 2000 she was shopping in the produce department of the defendant's Superstore located at 1621 Albert Street in Regina when at approximately 3:45 p.m. she suddenly slipped on a puddle of water on the floor and fell heavily to the ground, injuring her lower back, right knee and left ankle. Suffice it to say that some of the injuries the plaintiff claimed occurred as a result of her slip and fall on March 28, 2000, appear to have been at least in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. A ""sweep log"" was kept for each department and entries of these cleaning activities were made and initialled by the employees performing the work. CONCLUSION [11] The defendant, as owner and occupier of the Superstore, had a duty of care to the plaintiff. On the basis of all of the evidence, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has met the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor of the store. The evidence does not support an inference that the plaintiff's footwear caused or was a contributing factor to the slip and fall. A regular program of maintenance had been conducted by the defendant in that area of the store. [21] I conclude that the defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and is not liable for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard upon the defendant in this case that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this Court in almost identical circumstances. [22] Accordingly, the plaintiff's claim is dismissed with costs.

Her previous criminal record was not of character which interfered with her ability to appreciate her surroundings, control her actions or understand the consequences of them. 3) There are many different combinations of subjective and objective culpability which are possible.","Disposition: Allowed On February 11, 2009, the sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of two years less one day to be followed by two years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. I am satisfied the appeal should be allowed on the basis of this latter ground. I am, however, satisfied this same limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentencing and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances. Taking into account the mitigating factors already identified, in particular the respondent\'s post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in Bighead leads me to conclude a sentence of six years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below. Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed.",0.4581005586592179,0.47085201793721976,"The Crown appealed a sentence of 26 months in pre-trial custody and 2 years probation imposed for the manslaughter of a seven-month-old child.

The respondent's acknowledgment of responsibility, her expressions of remorse, her abusive background which may have caused symptoms of PTSD, and her socioeconomic situation all contribute to the offence. 2)The sentencing judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability in it and failed to properly consider this factor. 3)The respondent's dysfunctional upbringing or dysfunctional life was put forth by the Crown as an aggravating factor. The judge asked Crown counsel whether it could in fact be a mitigating factor. Counsel responded whether it was mitigating factor or not. 4)The court found the respondent had a high risk to re-offend and had compelling personal circumstances. 5)The sentence imposed did not adequately address the principles of denunciation and general deterrence. The court found that the respondent was in a position of trust and authority and did not seek immediate help when it was apparent the child was injured. 6)The Court found that a reasonable starting point for a custodial sentence for unlawful act manslaughter is seven years. The sentence imposed was based on the factors set out in R. v. Hathway. The Court also found that sentencing guidelines for adults who kill children do not require a detailed analysis of the factors considered in this case.",0.6013745704467355

The accused had been released from prison on a promise to appear in court on a charge of sexual assault. He had been injured and was unable to find a living accommodation. He applied for an order for forfeiture of recognizance. The Crown argued that the accused had no concept of his obligations under the recognizee and that it would not be just nor appropriate to order forfeiture. The surety contended that he had been forced to sign a recognizant and that he was not aware that he himself could be subject to imprisonment under s. 773 in the event of default. HELD: The applications for forfeiture were dismissed. The court found that the surety had no idea of his obligation under the agreement and that the fact that he might be subject for a period of time to be unable to pay any amount that may be ordered against him and that an order could be triggered. The fact that the defendant had a disability and was not able to drive made it unnecessary for him to exercise his right to drive. The applicant had no awareness of his responsibilities under the deal and was therefore not able or willing to exercise them. The defendant was not only subject to a severe financial hardship but also to a prospect of losing his employment and a considerable amount of his income. The failure to appear for trial would be a serious and life-threatening prospect for the accused. The sentence for imprisonment under the Criminal Code could be increased to a sentence of imprisonment under ss. 774. The only other penalty for failure to comply with the recognizaance was a fine.,"Hall, J.

[3] The accused was charged with four offences with respect to a twelve year old girl which allegedly occurred during the month of December, 1997.

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The youth court judge did not err in refusing to direct that the applicant have counsel appointed to him. 2)The Youth Court's discretion to determine inability is not limited solely to considerations of financial inability. In R. v. J.H. the young person was facing a variety of charges including failure to comply with conditions of an undertaking, failure to attend court, possession of property obtained by crime and obstructing peace officer. The young person's parents were both on social assistance and would likely be unable to provide financial assistance. 3)The young person had no resources to obtain counsel through Legal Aid initially. He advised the court that his aunt was unable to assist him financially. The Youth Court Judge then asked why the youth did not stick with his Legal Aid lawyer. The youth argued that the Court was limited to inquiries regarding the ability of a parent or family member to provide assistance. If the result of the inquiry is that the youth person has no financial resources whatsoever available to him, counsel must be appointed. The use of the word'shall' means the court has no jurisdiction to decline the request. 4)The court was of the view that the Youth Court was not in a position to refuse the application on the basis that it was not a case where the youth court had jurisdiction to inquire into the means of the parents. It was also of the opinion that once a youth makes a request of the youth Court for representation by counsel the language of s.11(4(b) on plain reading makes it abundantly clear that the exercise of discretion is no longer an option and the making of an order becomes mandatory. 5)The Court held that because the Act makes inability to obtain a counsel the touchstone for the analysis, the youth judge has every right to determine ability and has discretion to decide on case by case basis whether it exists.","[1] This is an application for orders of certiorari and mandamus concerning a decision of a Youth Court judge not to appoint counsel to represent a young person.

8_1995canlii4545.txt,"The 46-year-old female plaintiff sought damages for injuries suffered as a result of a motor vehicle accident. Her car was stopped by a flagman as a result of highway work when the defendant's vehicle struck her from behind. Awarding $15,000 for the whiplash injury and $75,000 for back injury as general damages. This amount was reduced to $25,000 due to a pre-existing condition. The court was satisfied there were degenerative changes in the plaintiffs spine which were accelerated by the accident. The pain problems were caused or contributed to by the defendant's negligence. An award for lost wages was also reduced by a factor of 33.%.","The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident. The accident occurred when the plaintiff was stopped on a highway by a flagman to allow piece of heavy machinery to back out onto the roadway. The plaintiff was unable to work due to a back condition. She underwent degenerative changes in her spine which caused her to miss some time from work. She was unable or unwilling to work because of the injuries suffered. She had been working for nine years prior to the accident. She suffered from osteoarthritis, a chronic back condition which required treatment of steroids, a hip replacement and pain medication. She also suffered from chronic lung disease, which required treatments of such nature as to prevent her from returning to work. The defendant admitted liability for the injuries he caused her. The court awarded the plaintiff $25,000 for the back injury. The amount for loss of income was fixed at $30,305.12. The total award was fixed $70,305 for the injury and $5,875 for the lower back injury as well as the $25k for the whiplash injury.","This is an action for damages for injuries suffered by the plaintiff as a result of a motor vehicle accident which occurred on May 31, 1988. On the totality of the evidence presented, I am satisfied that at the time of the accident the plaintiff was undergoing degenerative changes in her spine. I find that the plaintiff has discharged its burden of establishing, on a balance of probabilities, that the described pain problems were caused, or contributed to, by the defendant\'s negligence. I find that for this injury the plaintiff is entitled to an award in the amount of $15,000.

HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person. The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","HELD: The appellant appeals from a decision of the Office of Residential Tenancies, dated August 27, 2009. The appellant claims that the Landlord has breached the rights of the tenant by serving notice to vacate and seeks an order for possession of the rental unit. The hearing officer found that there was no participation by both owners in entering into the lease agreement.  1) The Act applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. 2) There was no express or implied consent of the landlord or tenant in entering the tenancy agreement. The Act also defines landlord as 'the owner's agent or another person who, on behalf of the owner, grants to another person the exclusive right of tenancy to a rental unit' (see s. 2(f)(i) of which the landlord is the landlord to the tenant). 3) Section 19 of the Act outlines the requirements for written tenancy agreements. One of the requirements is that a written tenancy agreement must contain the standard legal names of a landlord and the tenant. The Hearing Officer did err in law in declaring that the landlord had not provided the tenant with a written agreement that substantially complies with the provisions of s. 7(f) and s. 8(e) of the Residential Tenancy Act. 4) Section 70 of the Code of Regulations and the tenancy agreements between the landlord and tenant refer to a tenancy agreement between the tenant and the landlord. The tenant had signed a 3-year lease in 1960 and had a year lease. She sought an order of vacate in order that she could move into her new home. 5) Section 7 of the Regulations applies to rental units and other residential property. Section 20 of the ACT provides that to create a fixed term tenancy of three months or longer, the tenant must enter into a written lease. Section 21 provides that the hearing officer may make an order respecting a rental agreement, rental unit, or a lease, or an order made pursuant to s. 33. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) In this case the Hearing Officer made an error in law by finding she had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the landlords and tenant.  2) The Court of Appeal held that the Court of Queen's Bench found that it was in the public interest to hold a hearing on this matter. 3) The court found that the Act does not apply to rental agreements, rental units, or any residential property (see S. 3(1)). 4) It held that","[1] Sheila Buch appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of Residential Tenancies, dated August 27, 2009.

The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes.

It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction.

He saw no reason on the evidence to doubt her competence and that the contract was advantageous to the Clement family. 3)The appellant made no effort to attack the contract. She signed the contract before the solicitor and after her signature was affixed to it. The evidence was clear that the appellant had not been fully aware of the value of the land at the time of the signing. 4)The evidence was not relevant to the issue of whether the central facts were supported by the probative and probative findings. The issues were whether the court could interfere with the findings of facts. 5)The court found that the issues raised were factual and that there was no question the standard was met in HLL v.Canada. The court found the respondent McLaughlin was not shown to have breached or failed any professional obligation. The contract was beneficial to the appellant. The fact that she had the right to keep the residence and yardsite for as long as she wanted could easily have led her to exclude or disregard the value.

The contract was advantageous to the appellant as it allowed her to keep the residence and yardsite for as long as she wanted. The parties then lived with the contract for at least two years. 3)The appellant made much of the fact that she signed the contract before the solicitor for the appellant. She also sought relief against her solicitor for negligence.","Disposition: Dismissed (Orally)
 [1] This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. In those circumstances it is impossible for us as a court of appeal to interfere with these findings, even had we wished to. [17] Again, as with the attempts to set aside the contract, the claims against the solicitor are without a factual basis.

The claims against the solicitor were without a factual basis and the appellant sought relief against her solicitor for negligence.

There was no doubt that it was. 2)The appellant was not shown to have breached or failed any professional obligation. The evidence was clear that the meeting with the solicitor was successful. 3)The court was not able to interfere with the findings of fact. 4)On these facts no possible attack on the contract exists.",0.4866666666666666

d_1990canlii4118.txt,"In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice. The plaintiff had correctly interpreted the clause as relating to the termination of the agreement, not of his employment. The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta. The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months. He was also awarded the loss resulting from the difference in vacation and loss of an auto allowance for the 15 months. For emotional trauma, which lasted only briefly, he received $500.","The plaintiff was an expatriate and a member of the Royal Navy. He was assigned to Canada as an expat and worked for several years as a surveyor. He later became a manager of a company in Nova Scotia. The company offered him monies that had been paid to the plaintiff in the past and he refused to take them. He became depressed and went into deep depression. The defendant gave him two days written notice of termination without cause. He applied for and was granted a position with the plaintiff. The plaintiff was awarded a salary of $67,389.00. He claimed that this was a reasonable time to move. The clause of the agreement did not refer to termination of his employment by the defendant, but rather to termination. The lawyer for the plaintiff testified that he had no recollection of the meeting with the defendant and that he was advised that the contract would terminate on 30 days notice. He also claimed that he did not take the position because he believed there would be no alternative employment.

While, strictly speaking the plaintiffs weren't actual parties to the city's contract they were not involved in the rotation. 3)Costs claimed by the plaintiffs are excessive and do not properly take into account: Actual operating expenses for the time complained about; (b)the net affect of mitigating factors; and (c) reliable calculation of the administration of rotation of work. 4)Each case is dismissed.","[6] The issue of privity of contract could have been a critical issue in different circumstances but, in the end, this case will not turn on the question of privity.

The defendants had pleaded that there was no privity of contract between the plaintiffs and the City and that the plaintiffs were prevented from enforcing it. HELD: The case was dismissed. 1)The first sentence of the specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged on that breach and that any breach occurred. 2)The plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the City. The general thrust of all of the evidence was that certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to the members of the Independent Truckers Association. The factual evidence was in conflict but found that the defendants made some effort to include the plaintiffs in the rotation. Problematically, for the plaintiffs there is no contractual obligation in the agreement of January 1997 which requires the defendants to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work and the contract between them and the city is not incorporated by a specific or general reference. 3)The issue of privity could have been a critical issue in different circumstances but in the end this case will not turn on the question of it.",0.7272727272727272

He had been previously convicted of two counts of theft and one count of obstruction. 3) The trial judge was correct in distinguishing R. v.

It requires only that an accused be capable of recounting the facts of the alleged crimes and that he is able to appreciate his own best interests. 2) The test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness is a very low threshold for fitness in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and, in particular, with the right of the accused to make a full answer and defence to the allegations with which he is charged. It is not necessary that the accused be able to reason on higher cognitive levels, because of his lack of abstraction, and because of being 'locked in his delusional system.' 3) There are strong interests, both public and personal, in an accused being fit to proceed to trial. A person who is found not guilty by reason of a mental disorder is presumed to be fit to be tried. However, a person who suffers from a severe mental disorder (e.g. schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, or ADD) may be excluded from the trial. 4) The respondent has not been convicted in relation to any of the allegations.

He appeals both conviction and sentence. The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment. The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies.

While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case.

If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order.

The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat.

The words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint joint venture, rather of selling their vote by so doing.

The parties argued that the provision of 'participation interest' did not constitute a sale of voting rights.

The phrase 'transfer' was not intended to include a whole or a part of the project's potential to be developed or developed. The word 'participated interest' was used to add to the meaning of'subject matter' of the clause 'participate interest' to add the phrase to the definition of 'contributive interest' or'substantial new contractual obligation'. The phrase was not meant to create a whole 'favourable' or surplus of assets or to add an alternative meaning to a whole `gift' to the word'share' or to subtract a whole lot of assets from the meaning 'participant interest' which would not be a whole right of first refusal under the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement.","Disposition: Dismissed (orally) Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole.

8_1995canlii5717.txt,"The Respondent and the Applicant had a violent argument after which the Applicant and the child left the matrimonial home and moved to Transition House. The Applicant sought and obtained an emergency intervention order under The Victims of Domestic Violence Act from a Justice of the Peace giving her exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home and restraining her husband from having any contact with her or their daughter during the currency of the order. This order was then brought before a Queen's Bench Judge as required by s.5 of the Act for review. The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section. The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered. HELD: Order vacated.  1)An emergency intervention order is granted by a Justice of the Peace under s.3 of the Act without notice to the person whose conduct it restrains and without any representations from that person or on that person's behalf. It is an extraordinary remedy to be granted only where serious and urgent circumstances indicate a need for prompt action to protect the victim. 2)Absent such urgency, the application should be one for a 'victim's assistance order' brought to a Queen's Bench Judge in Chambers under s.7 in accordance with The Queen's Bench Rules. 3)In this case the domestic violence complained of occurred on January 28. There was no evidence that on February 1, 1995, Dolgopol was at risk of immediate harm. There was by then no element of urgency and the application for relief should have awaited the regular Queen's Bench Family Law Division chamber sittings.  4)The Court commented that it was unclear whether this rehearing was to proceed de novo or as a review but determined that the order should not stand in any event and therefore terminated it forthwith.",The accused was granted exclusive occupation of the family residence and restraining the accused from having contact with his wife or daughter during the course of the order. The accused was also ordered to refrain from having any contact with the wife or child during the period of the restraining order.

HELD: The contract between the parties was solely for installation and monitoring. The contract did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair the equipment at the plaintiff's business. The Court was satisfied that the defendant was monitoring the signal from the plaintiff's business on the dates in question and no alarm was received. It is not possible to say with any certainty why the defendant did not receive an alarm, but the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff was regularly having its monitoring equipment serviced or repaired.

e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent sought to vary two orders issued in 1998 and 2001. He wants to expunge the arrears in respect of each and also seeks a declaration that their three children are no longer children of the marriage. HELD: 1) The arrear of child support owed by the respondent was $186,746. The petitioner had been working as a registered nurse for several years prior to the separation and had received some money from Social Services to help pay for her university education. The respondent had not been paying child support for some time and had been unable to obtain employment that could pay him handsomely. He had been paying the arsars for years and had now retired. The court found that the respondent did not have the ability to pay the arrars because he could have taken employment that paid him at least $110,000 a year. He knew that he was expected to maximize his earning capacity but simply chose not to. 2) The respondent was found to have been acting erratically. The Court found that he did not owe child support on the two orders. The arsors owed by both orders were dismissed. The parties were entitled to an amount of child care and support. The father was found not to have the financial means to pay child support. 3) The court considered the following factors: 1. The applicant had $58,000 left over after paying his living expenses in 2011. He was entitled to $1,689 after paying ongoing monthly child support of $1.689 after that date. He did not need to take employment that would pay him more money. He would have been able to pay more child support if he had taken employment which paid him less money. The fact that he had a pension income of $109,000 did not mean that he would not have been unable. The child support arreared owed by him was reduced by $1 to $183,738. The mother was entitled not to pay any more child care expenses. The husband was entitled only to $5,427 for the child support he owed in 2011 and $58 for the children's care in 2012. The wife was entitled $1 per month in child support until she died. The children were entitled $2,000 in child care. The spouse was entitled a portion of the child care costs. The family was entitled an additional $1 million. The party was entitled the remaining $1 in child child support and the ar","3) The respondent seeks to vary two orders, one that was issued in 1998 and the other that was issued in 2001. He wants to expunge the arrears in respect of each and also seeks a declaration that their three children are no longer children of the marriage. I do not accept that assertion. Thabani suffers from a serious psychotic illness and has lived with the petitioner continuously. 22) In summary, I find that Mandela ceased to be a child of the marriage on June 30, 2002 and Bogani ceased being a child of the marriage on June 30, 2008 (June 30 being the approximate date of the end of the school year).

After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent seeks to vary two orders issued in 1998 and 2001. He wants to expunge the arrears in respect of each and also seeks a declaration that their three children are no longer children of the marriage. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The respondent was 72 years old and practising internal medicine in the United States. He is looking to retire in the next few years and does not want the issue of child support to interfere with his plans. 2) The court found that the respondent did not have the ability to pay child support because he had taken employment that paid him at least $110,000 a year. He knew that he was expected to maximize his earning capacity but simply chose not to. The fact remains that rather than seek employment that could pay him handsomely, he chose to flail away in private practice for years and earn much less than he otherwise would have. 3) The Court found that, in the absence of some special circumstance, the respondent will have few lean years until he has paid off the child support arrear. 4) The petitioner had $58,000 left over after paying his living expenses in 2011. 5) The father had not been paying child support for 12 years. The court calculated that he did not currently have the capacity to pay the child's support. 6) There was no undue hardship to either party. 7) The parties were able to rely on one another for support. 8) It was not necessary after this finding to comment on the other factors set out in Wurmlinger and D.B.S. 35 that the court considered. 9) The amount owed by the respondent should not be based on the last imputed income of $109,912 but, rather, on his actual income over the years. It was repugnant to even suggest that reducing child support should be a matter of principle. 10) The child support obligation under the 2001 order was reduced by $1,000 to $176,746.","3) The respondent seeks to vary two orders, one that was issued in 1998 and the other that was issued in 2001.

The evidence was rife with hearsay and very prejudicial to the appellant’s credibility. The Crown did not call a witness. The appeal raised issues of admissibility of evidence, admisseness of evidence and the appropriateness of questions asked of the appellant in cross-examination, and the impact on the integrity and fairness of the trial. The words spoken in jest were meant for a purpose. The accused had not knowingly threatened anyone or anyone. The only issue the trial judge identified was what was the intention of the accused when he first received the email was whether he intended the message to be sent to the student or to the faculty member. The Court found that he had not done so. The issue was whether the accused intended the student to read the contents of the email, as he did not run it as he de-bugged it. The question was whether it was reasonable to expect the accused to take the e.mail seriously and to give due consideration to a conditional discharge. The respondent was not counsel at trial and the court found the accused did not provide sufficient evidence to justify calling the accused.

The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","The appellant was a student at St. Francis Xavier University when he sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the professor did not take the content of the attachment as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant.

He was found guilty and was sentenced immediately following the conclusion of his trial to an 18 month suspended sentence, and placed on probation with conditions. Counsel was retained and an appeal commenced from conviction and sentence, alleging improper admission of evidence, unfair and prejudicial cross-examination of the appellant and a failure to give due consideration to a conditional discharge.

Counsel was retained and an appeal commenced from conviction and sentence, alleging improper admission of evidence, unfair and prejudicial cross-examination of the appellant and a failure to give due consideration to a conditional discharge. [45] The evidence of Mr. MacAulay certainly suggested that the appellant had a psychiatric illness and was a dangerous person requiring mandatory hospitalization before and after the October 24 email. This includes the suggestion that the appellant had a psychiatric illness, both before and after the email was sent, as long ago as 2005. [98] Taking into account all of the circumstances, including the words used; the fact they appeared in an attachment as part of a computer program containing other unusual phrases; there was no animosity between the person who received the attachment, Professor Van Bommel and the appellant; and no reason for the appellant to want to intimidate or provoke Van Bommel, it is equally open to infer that the words had been typed in that file to get a reaction from people that the appellant, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his key strokes, and did not constitute a threat to cause death to Martin Van Bommel, nor can it properly be concluded that the appellant intended to do so.

The respondent’s solicitors filed the certificate of pending litigation after his death. The appellant transferred the land subject to the certificate of pending litigation into her name only and entered into an agreement to sell the land, which could not proceed with the certificate of pending litigation. HELD: The appeal was of sufficient merit and it was not prima facie frivolous or vexatious. The appeal, however, was not found to be of sufficient importance to the practice of law or the Court of Queen’s Bench to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal. There was no new, controversial or unusual issue of practice raised by the appeal. The issues were determined to be better left for resolution by the Court of Queen’s Bench after hearing vive voce evidence at trial.","The wife sought to appeal from a chambers judge's decision not to vacate a certificate of pending litigation registered on behalf of her estranged husband. The husband's estate was represented by his executors. The wife had filed a notice of appeal in the matter prior to his death, and subsequently transferred the lands into her own name and entered into an agreement to sell them. The chambers judge did not consider whether the order appealed was interlocutory or final in nature. The proposed appeal does not raise a new or controversial or unusual issue. Nor does it raise a particular in its implications. The only issue raised was whether the judge exercised his discretion within the criteria set out in Rimmer Adshead. HELD: The proposed appeals are of sufficient merit to warrant determination by a panel of this Court. 1)The proposed appeal doesn't raise a 'new or controversial' issue. The court is one of review only: review to determine if the judge abused his discretion. Given the nature of the impugned order, it does not bear heavily or favourably on the former. 2)The court is not a party to the debate on the merits. The Court is not one to speculate on the future course of litigation. The appeal is of sufficient importance to the proceedings before the Court of Queen's Bench, or to the field of practice or the state of the law, or the administration of justice generally, to warrant a determination by panel of the Court. 3)The proposal would involve revisiting an interlocutorutory order that preserves the status quo pending final decision after trial. The draft notice of appeals is not confined to whether the chambers judge exercised the discretion within criteria which bear upon the proper exercise of his judicial discretion. 4)The draft notice is not limited to whether a chambers court exercised its discretion within its criteria which are case sensitive. Rather, it invites the Court to retry matters and, to some extent, reweigh evidence so as to supplant the chambers judges findings and conclusions. Appellate review of discretionary decision is one for review for vitiating error; it is not hearing de novo. 5)The Court is hard pressed to conclude the proposed appeal is sufficient importance. The matter is of interest to the Court before it, or at the field or the court of practice, or in the administration, to a panel. The governing criteria may be reduced to two each of which features a subset of considerations provided it constitute conventional considerations rather than fixed rules, that they are case sensitivity, and their point by point reduction is","Disposition: Dismissed [1] Shirley Mae deBalinhard wishes to appeal from the decision of the chambers judge (indexed as 2014 SKQB 239 (CanLII)), made pursuant to s. 47 of The Queen’s Bench Act, 1998, SS 1998, c Q-1.01, not to vacate a certificate of pending litigation registered on behalf of her estranged husband, John Canagy deBalinhard, against title to certain lands.

e_2012skpc161.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","The accused, a 17 year old Metis youth, was charged with aggravated assault thereby endangering the life of a victim and breach of his undertaking to keep the peace and be of good behaviour, contrary to s. 145(3) of the Criminal Code and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence that he report to his youth worker, contrary, s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The accused was sentenced to 24 months custody followed by a period of probation with credit for pre-sentence detention and 6 months community supervision. The accused will be permanently disabled. The court designated the offence as a serious violent offence pursuant to s 42(9) of The Youth Criminal Code. The young person did not oppose the Crown's application. The Court noted that the young person had expressed remorse for his actions in his letter and expressed his regret for the assault. The offence was a serious and life-altering violent offence. The offender will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence. Mitigating is the early guilty plea, thereby saving the complainant the additional anguish of having to testify at a trial. While in pre- sentence detention, the young offender has done reasonably well. While the accused remained in detention, he remained in a mental institution and suffered from severe anxiety and depression. The Crown appealed the sentence. HOLD: The court found the accused was at a high risk to re-offend violently. The sentence would allow the time frame required for the young to stabilize and engage with support services prior to his release in the community. The lengthy sentence would assist in participating in programming for substance abuse, as well as in programming, programming, anger management and anger management. The youth sentence would enable the time frames required for him to stabilize, engage with and engage in support services before his release. The length of sentence would be appropriate for a youth sentenced to a minimum of 24 months. The sentencing guidelines for youth sentenced were set out in R. v. J. (W.J.); R. (R. v.) (CanLII), 2010 SKPC 88 (CanlII), and the sentencing guidelines were followed. The offences were committed in a secure facility. The victim was to be permanently injured. The defendant was to have a further 12 months custody. The judge noted that there was a reasonable risk of him being convicted of the assault and that the accused would be able to rehabilitate and reintegrate into society.","He has also pleaded guilty to breaching his undertaking to keep the peace and be of good behaviour, contrary to s. 145(3) of the Criminal Code and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence that he report to his youth worker, contrary to s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA).

One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","The accused pleaded guilty to aggravated assault thereby endangering the life of the victim contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence that he report to his youth worker.

The young person did not oppose the Crown's application. A period of custody was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. The accused had been subject to release conditions in relation to a weapons offence for three years and had not been seen for more than one year. Mitigating is the early guilty plea, thereby saving the complainant the additional anguish of having to testify at a trial.

[3] The Crown applied under section 42(9) of the YCJA for a determination that the aggravated assault be designated as a serious violent offence. [12] On the aggravated assault, the Crown seeks the maximum allowable custodial sentence of 24 months and submits that 16 months of that sentence ought to be served in a secure setting, followed by 8 months of community supervision.

[21] In these circumstances, and given the young person did not oppose the Crown’s application, I find this was a serious violent offence and I designate it as such, pursuant to s. 42(9) of the YCJA.

HELD: The appeal was allowed on the same basis as the previous appeal. 1)The issues raised by the appellant in this case were exactly the same as those raised in another judgment, issued concurrently with this one. 2)The appellant only raised two issues: 1)Did the assessment Appeals Committee err in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the assessment manual in determining the market adjustment factors for the appellant properties by using a single sale to calculate the market adjust factor? 3)Did it err in principle in concluding that abnormal functional obsolescence does not apply to an add-on type of construction, or by finding that there must be an inability of an improvement to perform the function for which it is used? 4)The decision was arrived at not as a result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but as a consequence of the appellant's failure to establish to the satisfaction of the committee the facts on which it based its case.",0.665406427221172

The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT: The applicants, who are charged with cultivating and possession of marihuana, plead not guilty to the charges. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance on each accused dated January 30, 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones. In general terms it is the position of the applicants that the authorization for the electronic surveillance should be set aside, and as information obtained from the electronic monitoring was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant and the subsequent search warrant both of these warrants should also be set off on the basis they are derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful. The applicants seek to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrant excluded from trial and state it is also an appropriate case to direct a stay of proceedings on all charges against both applicants. HELD: The application for leave to cross-examine is granted when the trial judge is satisfied that cross-examination is necessary to enable the accused to make full answer and defence. The court noted that the 1993 amendments to s. 187 of the Code were no reason to grant leave to allow the cross- examination of witnesses with respect to an authorization for surveillance. The Crown relied on the British Columbia Court of Appeal decision of R. v. West (1998), 1997 CanLII 3792 (5th) 106. Preliminary Inquiry Evidence: The Crown sought to have preliminary inquiry evidence obtained under the authorization and warrant exclude from trial, and state that it is an appropriate evidence to direct the stay of proceeding on all counts against both defendants. The applicant sought to set off the search warrant on the grounds that police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the applicant's residence and that this action on the part of the police rendered the search unreasonable under s. 8 of the Charter. The Court noted that evidence tendered at the preliminary inquiry is part of a trial evidence and as such should be tendered viva voce, and in any event evidence given at the proceeding stage to set up a stay is requested to determine anyone else with whom they might be dealing. The application was also made to direct an application for a stay on all criminal charges against the applicants. The evidence obtained at the initial inquiry relevant to this application was admissible, subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.","As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel have brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside: (1) A section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance on each accused dated January 30, 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones. (2) A section 487.01(4) 9 day video surveillance authorization dated March 19, 1997 for the residence of the applicant Derksen authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. (3) A search warrant to search the residence of the applicant Derksen dated April 1, 1997 which resulted in the seizure of 365 marihuana plants and led to the present charges. The applicants seek to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrant excluded from trial, and state it is also an appropriate case to direct a stay of proceedings on all charges against both applicants. As a result, the boilerplate paragraphs offered on why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had or have no factual basis. In the end result, the applicant’s have satisfied the burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that the pre-conditions for the granting of an authorization set out in s. 186(1)(b) were not met. As a result the authorization dated January 30, 1997 is set aside. [28] The interceptions which occurred pursuant to the authorization of January 30, 1997 constituted a search and seizure within the meaning of s. 8 of the Charter, and as the search was not authorized by law the search was unreasonable and in breach of that section (Vide: R. v. Garofoli, supra, per Sopinka J. at p. 187). The video surveillance warrant therefore must be set aside. A good faith argument is not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the electronic surveillance authorization. The evidence obtained is equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant’s s. 8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised from the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. I conclude it is more likely than not the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute. [44] The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance authorization and the video surveillance warrant is ruled inadmissible at trial. One associate is a, who has also been in marihuana cultivation for years. [54] The absence of compellable detail of the alleged offence and the absence of the source of the informer’s knowledge means the information supplied for the Derksen search warrant did not provide a basis for the issuing justice of the peace to conclude reasonable and probable grounds existed for the issuance of the warrant, and the warrant must be set aside. [57] I do not consider the seriousness of the breach in this case to be at the high end of the scale. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there is nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that leads to a conclusion of bad faith in applying for the search warrant. As a result, on balance I conclude the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence. [67] In the end result, the seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the marihuana plants obtained, which is crucial to any successful prosecution of Mr. Derksen, outweighs the breach of his s. 8 Charter rights to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. I conclude it is more likely than not that exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of his premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. With respect to the improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused, this is a collateral matter and does not affect the fairness of the trial.

Preliminary inquiry evidence could not be considered for admissibility until it was made evidence on this application, and the Crown acknowledged that neither of the applicants had any criminal record. The focus of the investigation was not on the people who were buying the drugs from the applicant but was on who the applicant's suppliers were. The search warrant was requested to determine who was the supplier of the drugs. The Crown relied on the British Columbia Court of Appeal decision of R. v. West (1998), 1997 CanLII 3792 (5th C.R.R.) 106 for preliminary inquiry evidence. The court found that the Crown did not try any investigative procedures available to them before applying for the authorization and as the matter was not urgent s. 186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Court found that it is not necessary that other investigative procedures be resorted to prior to applying for an authorization.","As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel have brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside: (1) A section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance on each accused dated January 30, 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones. (2) A section 487.01(4) 9 day video surveillance authorization dated March 19, 1997 for the residence of the applicant Derksen authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. (3) A search warrant to search the residence of the applicant Derksen dated April 1, 1997 which resulted in the seizure of 365 marihuana plants and led to the present charges. The applicants seek to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrant excluded from trial, and state it is also an appropriate case to direct a stay of proceedings on all charges against both applicants. As a result, the boilerplate paragraphs offered on why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had or have no factual basis. In the end result, the applicant’s have satisfied the burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that the pre-conditions for the granting of an authorization set out in s. 186(1)(b) were not met. As a result the authorization dated January 30, 1997 is set aside. [28] The interceptions which occurred pursuant to the authorization of January 30, 1997 constituted a search and seizure within the meaning of s. 8 of the Charter, and as the search was not authorized by law the search was unreasonable and in breach of that section (Vide: R. v. Garofoli, supra, per Sopinka J. at p. 187). The video surveillance warrant therefore must be set aside. A good faith argument is not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the electronic surveillance authorization. The evidence obtained is equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant’s s. 8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised from the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. I conclude it is more likely than not the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute. [44] The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance authorization and the video surveillance warrant is ruled inadmissible at trial. One associate is a, who has also been in marihuana cultivation for years. [54] The absence of compellable detail of the alleged offence and the absence of the source of the informer’s knowledge means the information supplied for the Derksen search warrant did not provide a basis for the issuing justice of the peace to conclude reasonable and probable grounds existed for the issuance of the warrant, and the warrant must be set aside. [57] I do not consider the seriousness of the breach in this case to be at the high end of the scale. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there is nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that leads to a conclusion of bad faith in applying for the search warrant. As a result, on balance I conclude the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence. [67] In the end result, the seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the marihuana plants obtained, which is crucial to any successful prosecution of Mr. Derksen, outweighs the breach of his s. 8 Charter rights to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. I conclude it is more likely than not that exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of his premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. With respect to the improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused, this is a collateral matter and does not affect the fairness of the trial. The application for a stay of proceedings is dismissed.",0.44265593561368205,0.3746835443037974,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT: The applicants, who are charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana, plead not guilty to the charges. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel have brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance on each accused and a section 487.01(4) 9 day video surveillance authorization for the residence of the applicant authorizing the observance of a marijuana grow operation.

Preliminary Inquiry Evidence: The Crown relies on R. v. West (1998), 1997 CanLII 3792 (BC CA), 12 C.R.

[54] The absence of compellable detail of the alleged offence and the absence of the source of the informer’s knowledge means the information supplied for the Derksen search warrant did not provide a basis for the issuing justice of the peace to conclude reasonable and probable grounds existed for the issuance of the warrant, and the warrant must be set aside. [57] I do not consider the seriousness of the breach in this case to be at the high end of the scale. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there is nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that leads to a conclusion of bad faith in applying for the search warrant. As a result, on balance I conclude the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence. [67] In the end result, the seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the marihuana plants obtained, which is crucial to any successful prosecution of Mr. Derksen, outweighs the breach of his s. 8 Charter rights to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. I conclude it is more likely than not that exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of his premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. With respect to the improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused, this is a collateral matter and does not affect the fairness of the trial. The application for a stay of proceedings is dismissed.",0.46123260437375746,0.3558897243107769,"FIAT: The applicants, who are charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana, plead not guilty to the charges. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel have brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance on each accused and a section 487.01(4) 9 day video surveillance authorization for the residence of the applicant authorizing the observance of a marijuana grow operation. The applicants seek to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrant excluded from trial, and state it is also an appropriate case to direct a stay of proceedings on all charges against both applicants. HELD: The application for leave to cross-examine is granted and as information obtained from the electronic surveillance was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant and the subsequent search warrant both of these warrants should also be set aside on the basis they are derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful. Preliminary Inquiry Evidence: The Crown relies on R. v. West (1998), 1997 CanLII 3792 (BC CA), 12 C.R. (5th) 106 for its conclusion that given the 1993 amendments to s. 187 of the Code, there is no reason that the granting of leave to a cross-examination should be the preserve of the trial judge. It is an absolute waste of time and money to require duplication of such evidence on the Charter hearing. There are other factors that can be considered in support of the application including the fact that the applicant's residence is part of the complainant’s property and the search warrant was requested to determine anyone else with whom they might be dealing. The Crown relied on the British Columbia Court of Appeal decision of R. vs. West which held that evidence given at the preliminary inquiry should not be used as trial evidence in cases in which it has not been judicially exercised. In general terms it is the position of the applicants that the authorization for e-curve, video surveillance, and/or a 9 day surveillance authorization should be set- aside. The balance of this paragraph consisting of sub-clauses (b) to (h) have been edited out. The court noted that the RCMP did not try any investigative procedures available to them before applying for the authorization and as the matter was not urgent s. 186(1)(b) was not complied with.",0.437403400309119

He sought a declaration that a member of the police service must be informed of any investigation of his conduct prior to the commencement of the investigation as required by s.54 of the Police Act.; the Act does not permit the amendment in Form A discipline notice since it is a statutory form. The relief sought regarding disclosure had been abandoned by the applicant.

The respondent took the position that this Court should not entertain the application as there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act by way of appeal to the provincial Police Commission; that the Chief was entitled to amend the notice and would be entitled to grant leave if required; the hearing officer erred in holding that s.54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the subject member.

2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have him declared a dangerous offender. Defence counsel submitted the accused picked up a branch with the intention of using it against the officer and then swung the weapon at the officer, coming so close to the officer that it caused him to back away and pull his sidearm. The accused was sentenced to 15 years on these violent offences. The Crown appealed the decision. HELD: The accused is a serious personal injury offence. The offence is a'serious personal injury' offence as defined by s.752. The court found that the accused's actions involved the use of violence. The weapon was of such a size that, as the court noted when giving the decision after trial, there was no doubt that if struck in the head with this object, it could cause serious damage. The Court found that given the accused’s record of violent and dangerous acts, the Crown’d be justified in relying on s.725.1 and s.705.1. The fact that the offence was committed while the accused was in possession of a weapon and the accused had been drinking at the time of the offence, that the weapon was so large that it was likely to cause serious harm. The defence argued that the court should consider whether the accused has a history of violent or dangerous acts and whether the offence is serious enough to warrant an assessment under s.710.1 or s.786.1 of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the Crown should rely on s753.1 as a possible indicator of future behaviour. The evidence showed that the Crown had not proven that the offender had a history with violent or threatening behaviour.","[2] The Crown has applied, pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code, for an order remanding Mr. Ben for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have Mr. Ben declared a dangerous offender.

The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice.

The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be opened nor to participate in any potentially incriminating process until he has had that reasonable opportunity to contact counsel. 2)The respondent's right to a free and frank legal advice is not at risk in circumstances where the respondent has asserted his right to counsel and has been reasonably diligent in exercising it, but has been unable to reach a lawyer because duty counsel is unavailable. 3)The appellant's right of free and honest advice is unequivocal. The Crown has not proven that the appellant is frustrated. 4)The Crown has no evidence that the accused has changed his mind about seeking legal advice. The appellant's evidence shows that the police officer who stopped the appellant in a routine traffic stop of vehicles entering Saskatoon from the east was not aware that the detainee had changed his minds and declined legal advice and that the evidence shows the detainee who had previously asserted his rights to counsel had changed her mind and declined advice. 5)The accused was not given an unequivocal waiver of his right under s9(b)(d) to seek legal advice from a lawyer.

A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion.","The applicant bank loaned the respondent $37,700 upon a security of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer.

The defendants did not object to that request and accordingly the court ordered that they could proceed.  1) The plaintiff was entitled to continue with an action initiated prior to the defendant corporation's dissolution. 2) The Court was aware that there is case law authority that has found a contrary interpretation to similar provisions in other provinces. 3) The court was not prepared to follow other case law that supports the interpretation of s. 219(2)(a) of The Business Corporations Act. 4) It is clear that this action is part of a civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding commenced by or against the corporation may be continued as if the corporation had not been dissolved and that the Court has jurisdiction to hear this simplified trial despite the corporation being dissolved as at June 20/2012.  5) It was also confirmed that the certificate of dissolution pursuant to the Business Corporation Act, R.S. 1978, c. B-10, effective June 20, 2012 was filed with the Court.  6) There was a strong argument that the struck or dissolved corporation should be allowed to defend itself in an action commenced at the dissolution of the corporation.  7) The proper interpretation of the legislation was that based on the basic and fundamental principle of trial fairness not only should this trial be allowed, but that the dissolved corporate defendant should be granted the opportunity to defend its action commenced prior to its dissolution and that if the liability continues, that right should be defended. 8) Jurisdiction of the Court was confirmed.",0.6334310850439883
6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed.

She engaged the services of the defendant, Cecilia Mui, realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. After lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased the property in 1998 and it was owned by the defendants. The realtor was the defendant's realtor. She claimed aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against the plaintiff for failing to inform her that the home had been moved over 300 kilometres from its original building site. The plaintiff also claimed costs for alleged latent defects in the house. HELD: The plaintiff sues the defendants for recovery of damages for alleged defects in her home. She says that Ms. Mui and her company fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. She also says that the defendants are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the realtor and her husband. Special and general damages, including damages based upon mental and emotional distress, are claimed against all of the defendants and against the defendants, asserting that their acts and omissions exacerbated her distress. All allegations are denied by the defendant. In the event that any defects existed, the defendants were liable to the plaintiff in damages both in gross and general.","She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She says that Ms. Mui and RE/MAX Saskatoon fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, according to Ms. Schira, similarly misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently, both in information given to her which induced her, in part, to purchase the home, and in answers that they gave in a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. 106) With the above in mind, I have determined that certain of the evidence of each of Mr. Karpinski, Mrs. Karpinski and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. I have, accordingly, accepted the observations of Mr. Loraas and the opinions of Mr. Epp. 123) In considering the liability of each of the defendants I have, as previously noted, accepted the conclusions and opinions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp. In particular, I find:
(i) The pine shakes were rotting and many were cracked to such an extent that water could permeate the underlying joints and decking. 130) In this case, I have concluded that Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski did not speak “truthfully and completely” when answering all the questions in the PCDS. However, given their lack of veracity on key issues, I do not accept that they were unaware of other water and moisture damage, whether arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or inadequate venting that was occurring elsewhere in the interior of the house. Accordingly I find Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski liable to Ms. Schira for breach of contract for failing to disclose in questions B, F and G of the PCDS the existence of structural defects, damage due to water, and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the Karpinskis and Ms. Schira, and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. For reasons already set out, I would find that the false representations knowingly made by Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, and their silence as to material facts, were fraudulent. I have concluded that Ms. Mui was negligent and that her conduct and advice to Ms. Schira fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. Further, had Ms. Mui fulfilled her obligation first to disclose all material facts to Ms. Schira, and second, to explain and, in these circumstances, recommend a home inspection, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the outcome for Ms. Schira would have been different. 148) I am satisfied however that Mr. Jacobucci is liable to Ms. Schira for negligent misrepresentation.

Accordingly I find Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski liable to Ms. Schira for breach of contract for failing to disclose in questions B, F and G of the PCDS the existence of structural defects, damage due to water, and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the Karpinskis and Ms. Schira, and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. For reasons already set out, I would find that the false representations knowingly made by Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, and their silence as to material facts, were fraudulent. I have concluded that Ms. Mui was negligent and that her conduct and advice to Ms. Schira fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. Further, had Ms. Mui fulfilled her obligation first to disclose all material facts to Ms. Schira, and second, to explain and, in these circumstances, recommend a home inspection, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the outcome for Ms. Schira would have been different. 148) I am satisfied however that Mr. Jacobucci is liable to Ms. Schira for negligent misrepresentation. I award Ms. Schira $15,000 as compensation for the personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the house. However, there is no evidence that the distress that she experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness. 166) There will be an award for aggravated damages, with respect to all defendants, in the amount of $10,000. 169) This aspect of Ms. Schira’s claim for damages is accordingly dismissed. Conclusion 176) While Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski are liable for breach of contract, each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to Ms. Schira, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. 1. Ms. Schira shall have judgment against the defendants in the amount of $49,608.87. 1.

She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed.

However, prior to trial, she remained a party to the action. She did not participate except to the extent that Mr. Snider was called as a witness on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Karpinskis. 2) The property was not within the plaintiff's means.

The PCDS would be incorporated into the agreement. 3) The home did not meet the plaintiff’s expectations. She was not satisfied that she could not realistically afford to buy the home. She sued the defendants for damages in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the realtor.  4) The court found that the defendants were liable to the plaintiff in damages, both in the amount of $300,000 and in general damages, including damages based upon mental and emotional distress, as well as aggravated damages and general damages against the defendants.  5) All allegations are denied.

Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The court found that the search warrant was quashed in error. The warrant had been valid, the search was lawful and there was no allegation that it was otherwise unreasonable. However, the judge substituted his view of the evidence for those of the issuing JP. In a thorough and careful analysis the judge unquestionably articulated the appropriate legal principles. The judge applied the proper standard of review and concluded that the warrant could have been issued but instead had to be drawn as opposed to reasonable inferences as the test prescribes (and as the judge carefully articulated earlier in his judgment).

The defendant claimed that the tail lights were working when he took the vehicle to be appraised and took it in for repair. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment on the ground that there was an arguable issue to be tried on the facts presented, which was that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have enough care or control of his vehicle and consequently the collision occurred. The defence argued that there were other factors that could contribute to the plaintiff's health problems. The court granted the application.

The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s.15(1), 24(1) and 52(1)(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the applicants' rights as guaranteed under the Charter.

HELD: The application was granted on all fours with respect to the application to the Supreme Court of Canada in three cases. 1)The respondent is a wholly independent institution of post secondary education which manages, administers and controls its property, revenue, business and affairs through its Board of Governors and administration department. 2)There is no evidence of governmental control that could be regarded as an exercise of government power sufficient to bring the respondent within the application of the charter. 3)The applicant's contention that this creates the degree of governmental jurisdiction to warrant the application is untenable. The section by 'deeming' is only bringing employees who are not in the public service within the definitions required to be under that pension plan. The respondent is not an arm of the government but rather is a fully dependent institution of higher learning. 4)The court found that the respondent has a vested interest in the collective agreement between the respondent and the Faculty Association. The collective agreement does not indicate governmental control. It is governmental action. 5)Subject to s.17, for all purposes of the Pulic Service Superannuation Act the President, the members of the teaching staff and every full-time employee of the Board shall be deemed to be persons employed in the Public Service of the Province and such employment shall be considered public service. 6)The Court of Appeal held that the Charter applies only to government action. The Court of Queen's Bench held that if the Charter were held not to apply that would be fatal to this application. 7)The Supreme Court held that there was no evidence that governmental control could be considered as an act directly mandated by government and calculated to affect the public, but the performance of a private, consensual act between two parties.","NUNN, J.

5_1998canlii13955.txt,"An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits. The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work.

Leave was required because the notice was filed more than 20 days ago: Rule 62.04(4). The application is opposed by the respondent 2301072 Nova Scotia Limited and the intervenor 230102 Dominion Bank. The appellants wish to add as ground that the respondent, the plaintiff in the main action, is not a 'lawful plaintiff' and, therefore, not entitled to security for costs. The respondent and intervenor oppose the amendment on three grounds: first, that the allegations of champerty and maintenance that underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the chambers judge, were irrelevant to the security for cost application, were not ruled on by the chambers Judge and should not be raised on appeal; and second, that while the torts of chammperty and upkeep had been eliminated by the common law, the issues of chamsperty and Maintenance were not reasonably necessary to the appellants' presentation of their appeal.

The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it.

The court found that the defendant had abided by his release conditions over the past two and half years, had no previous criminal record, and was now serving the useful social purpose of looking after his ailing mother who lives on an isolated acreage and who will be punished if he is incarcerated. The defendant had no criminal record and did plead guilty albeit at the trial. The mitigating factors referred to by the defence included the fact that the accused had no prior criminal record but had been involved in a sexual offence for several years, and that he was a good citizen.

such stories, but simply agrees to stop doing so because the law requires it. [18] Based on the circumstances of this offence, and the circumstances
of the offender, I conclude that a conditional sentence would not be a fit sentence
on the facts in this matter, although I agree Mr. Houston qualifies for the same to
the extent a fit sentence would not exceed two years, and I agree on the limited
information available that he would not endanger the community if one were
imposed. A conditional sentence also would not be
strong enough to deter others who might be inclined to engage in the activity of
distributing child pornography. [19] I have taken into account the mitigating factors referred to by
counsel for the defence, such as the fact that Mr. Houston has no criminal record,
and did plead guilty, albeit at the opening of trial, along with the other material I
have referred to in the foregoing in arriving at what I consider to be the
appropriate length of sentence. Mr. Houston, I sentence you to 15 months
imprisonment, to be followed by a term of probation of three years, as well as the
additional orders I am about to make. Canada: (1) Pursuant to s. 490.012 of the Criminal Code, it is ordered you be
subject to an order which will issue in Form 52 requiring you to
comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, 2004,
S.C. c. 10, for a period of 20 years, which is the mandatory time
specified in s. 490.012(1) for a person convicted of distributing child
pornography. (2) Pursuant to s. 487.051 of the Criminal Code an order shall issue in
Form 5.03 which authorizes the taking of samples from you for
forensic DNA analysis.",0.5292929292929293,0.43668122270742354,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years, as well as an order requiring him to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, 2004 for a period of 20 years. The court found that the defendant had abided by his release conditions over the past two and half years, had no previous criminal record, and was now serving the useful social purpose of looking after his ailing mother who lives on an isolated acreage and who will be punished if he is incarcerated.  1)The defendant had no criminal record and did plead guilty. 2)A conditional sentence would not be a fit sentence as it would not deter others who might be inclined to engage in the activity of distributing child pornography. 3)The sentence was not fit for the circumstances of the offence. The defendant obstructed his release by writing hard core child pornography in several of his stories, which on the scale of written child pornography places it in the upper half of the scale. He directly encouraged others to produce similar stories which is an aggravating factor in this offence.","Mr. Houston was a high profile

The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT. The respondent sought an order for interim spousal support. HELD: The court concluded that relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should not take the form of child support. The petitioner did not have the means to make the indicated payments. The balance of $6,000 should be paid to the respondent by way of monthly payments in the amount of $500.  1)The respondent did not need financial assistance. It was suggested that because of his mental disability he could live in a group home and the cost would be relatively low. If one refers to that sum in the Federal Child Support Guidelines the related income exceeds $150,000. 2)There was no requirement that the respondent live in group home as there is no basis upon which he can order or expect such. 3)The petitioner had three sources of monthly income, namely: Canada Pension Disability Pension $1,049, Disability Insurance: London Life 583 and Pension for children from the Canada Pension Plan Benefits. Any payment order would not jeopardize the welfare of the children. 4)The court found that there was a sufficient total of means to enable the petitioner and the children to enjoy a reasonable standard of living and to enjoy an improved standard.","[1] This is an application wherein the respondent seeks an order for interim spousal support. [9] I can find no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue from land owned by her spouse, particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. Accordingly, I choose to make an order on the basis of the respondent’s ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support. This sum should be left with the petitioner to meet those obligations which presently form part of her monthly expenses as set out in her financial statement.

In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child.

The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed.

The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life.

The accused's action against the victim was done in a self- defence.","[1] The accused, Frederick Junior Knife (the “accused” or “Knife”), is charged with one count of aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at approximately 8:30 p.m. on September 1, 2008.

The s. 34(2) defence is to deal with the argument that the accused's actions against the victims were done in self-defence as contemplated by s.34(2).","[1] The accused, Frederick Junior Knife (the “accused” or “Knife”), is charged with one count of aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at approximately 8:30 p.m. on September 1, 2008. [33] I will next deal with the argument that Knife’s actions against Dorion were done in self‑defence as contemplated by s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code. [63] Accordingly, I conclude that the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted, within the meaning of the law, and that, even if he did hold this belief, which I find not to be the case, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Nonetheless, I reject both the subjective and objective components of the second prong of the test for the same reasons that I rejected the first prong of the test. However, as I stated previously, I do not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, Knife reasonably believed that Dorion had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. [71] Firstly, dealing with the subjective element, I find that Knife did not believe that he had no other option. However, I do not need to assess the application of s. 37 because I find that s. 27 of the Criminal Code is applicable. Consequently, I find that Demeria was clothed in legal justification when he entered the fray. I find, as well, that Knife is not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because Knife provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to enable him to defend himself. It is obvious from the video recordings that Knife was armed with a shank, whereas Demeria was not, and that stabbing Demeria and holding him so that he could not get away, as Dreaver and Knife were doing, was far more force than was necessary to enable him to defend himself. Conclusion [90] In the final analysis, I find that the Crown has made out all of the elements of both counts beyond a reasonable doubt and, therefore, find Frederick Junior Knife guilty of both Count 1 and Count 2 as specified in the indictment.",0.35797665369649806,0.2532894736842105,"HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the penitentiary at approximately 8:30 p.m. on September 1, 2008. The accused and the two alleged victims were inmates at the prison and were being held on 'B' Block. Given that the incident was captured by security videos, there is no doubt as to what happened. The issues raised by the accused pertain to how his actions ought to be characterized. The s. 34(2) defence is to deal with the argument that the accused's actions against the victims were done in self-defence as contemplated by s.34(2). HELD: 1)The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault. The Court held that the existence of an actual assault is not a prerequisite for the defence under s.33(2), as it is not currently available to the accused. 2)The court found that the Crown had failed to establish that the injuries inflicted were not serious enough to be considered 'aggravated'. 3)The Court found that, in all of the circumstances of this case, the accused inflicted injuries to the victim that fit within the category of an aggravated assault, and also constitute grievous bodily harm. 4)The Crown must establish the mental element. The Crown established that bodily harm was objectively foreseeable by the defendant because he was concerned about Dorion. The defendant admitted that he was the main threat to Dorion and that his intention was to hurt him so that he would not hurt himself. 5)The evidence established that the defendant was a joint principal offender and that he reasonably believed that Dorion assaulted him. 6)The defendant was found not guilty of any of the three elements of the offence.",0.47534766118836913

The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to provide forthwith a sample of his breath as in the opinion of Cst. Rozario. The accused chose not to disclose in his disclosure information the name of the 'ride along' nor even that there was a ride along. The officer testified that he observed the accused's vehicle swerve to the right and then to the left more than necessary as he approached it. The police vehicle swerved to the side of the highway more than it should have and the accused blew outside the mouthpiece. The officers testified that they had to stop the vehicle to check the driver's licence and registration. The RCMP officer testified on the Promise to Appeal served that he stopped the second test as the accused was blowing outside the gum. He said he thought he might have difficulty blowing a sufficient sample for the officer. The second test was stopped as the officer was blowing. The third test was done as the police vehicle slowed down and the officer explained to the accused that he needed a steady breath and that it was his last chance. The first test was performed as the vehicle swiped to the other side of a highway more frequently than necessary. The driver was given a warning that the vehicle was approaching and the police officer engaged the emergency lights. The vehicle stopped and the second breath test was run. The breath sample was given to the officer as a condition of his licence. The court accepted the evidence of the accused.,"[1] Andre Detillieux stands charged that on or about the 11th day of November, 2001 at Paddockwood District in the Province of Saskatchewan did without reasonable excuse, fail to comply with a demand made to him by Cst.

He waited for the ready light to come on. He said he thought he was having difficulty blowing a sufficient sample for the officer, but then realized that he needed a steady breath and that his lips had to be sealed. He ceased the test. 4)For reasons which were discussed later in the decision where there was discrepancy between testimony of both the officer's and accused's testimony, I accepted the evidence. The court accepted that the accused had not told the young, inexperienced officer of why he thought that he may have been having difficulty with blowing a sample for a roadside screening device. The young officer testified that he had helped his son skin a deer which his son had just shot. He had to use his prescribed inhaler then and again at the party where he had had his two or three beers. The last call came when they were at the pines just north of Prince Albert. After that the officer slowed down. He did not inform the accused of anything. Eventually at the detachment the accused said he was surprised when he was informed that he would be charged with refusal. He wrote on the Promise to Appeal served on him: “I did not refuse breath sample.” 5)The police officer was aware of the speed at which the accused drove and that he was only told once how to give proper sample although he","[1] Andre Detillieux stands charged that on or about the 11th day of November, 2001 at Paddockwood District in the Province of Saskatchewan did without reasonable excuse, fail to comply with a demand made to him by Cst.

Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.",0.4306784660766962,0.5310173697270472,"This was an appeal from a conviction for break, enter and theft contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.
