2003skqb487.txt,"At issue was the interim custody of the child and child support. HELD: Interim custody was given to the petitioner with access to the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month. On an interim custody application, the Court must take into account the status quo.","At issue on this application is the interim custody of the child of the petitioner and the respondent. The parties began to cohabit in 1998. In May 1999, the parties would'switch Keanna every second day' and that after that the respondent had access to every second weekend until November 2002 when the petitioner ended access. The respondent made no attempts at gaining custody until he was served with the application of the mother. HELD: The child has and does reside with the petitioner, with access and visitation arrangements to the respondent and various other persons. The petitioner has reasonable access including every second Sunday, reasonable telephone access and reasonable access during holiday periods. The child is likely affected to varying degrees by the discord between the parties. The court will make an interim order based on the current status quo. The mother shall have interim custody and the child shall have reasonable access every second week. The father shall pay child support in the amount of $193 per month commencing December 1/3 and a like amount on the first day of each month thereafter. The Court reviewed the various affidavits of the parties and found that both parties were loving parents to their child. The mutual love and acceptance demonstrated by the families and relatives of the party was self-evident and commendable. The Father shall pay his proportionate share of childcare costs (being 82.5% in the $103.5 per month figure) of $103 for the child and $206 for the parents. The Child shall have costs of her application."
2_2012nssc10.txt,"Rule 77.03 – Liability for costsThe court found in favor of the respondents after a half-day chambers hearing. They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim. Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two. This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing. While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs. The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner.","The Bowsers were successful as Respondents in Chambers, having applied to the Court for a declaration that there were been three parties entitled to a right of way across the land of the Bowsers. The applicants had initially been directed to June 23, 2011, but then faxed a Notice of Contest and Affidavit, both of which were rejected by the Court. The applicant then requested a full day of the hearing, and then a revised Notice of Objection. The Bowsers requested a time-lapse to reflect on the entire proceeding, and sought costs on a solicitor client basis. Rule 77.01(1)(a) and 77.02(1) of the Rules make it clear that the winning party in the litigation is presumptively entitled to partial compensation of their expenses of litigation. Customarily this has been viewed as substantial, but not complete indemnification of their costs of litigation, as concerns to what extent there should be partial compensation. The dispute was acrimonious and the applicants omitted some important information in making their claim. Ultimately the applicants, by omitting some important detail, undermined the strength of their claim and the court found that this should not be seen as outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible conduct."

The theft of a computer and modem exceeding $1,000 in value contrary to s.334(a) of the Criminal Code and mischief by damaging a motor vehicle and stealing the computer and a modem. 18 months to be served concurrently with the first offence on the theft charge. At issue on appeal was whether the sentence should be increased or reduced. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The sentence imposed was unfair. 2)The trial judge was correct in his remarks that general deterrence must be a matter of primary concern. 3)The appellant was found not guilty of both offences."
2007nspc30.txt,"Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction. The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground. The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib. The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence. Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge. The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant.","The accused was struck in the arm by the defendant's shovel and the defendant followed him with his fist. The shovel was not a weapon but rather a shovel. The defendant did not believe the accused's evidence and continued to struggle with the defendant, striking the victim in the ribs with his fists and striking the plaintiff on the arm. The court found that the accused had not believed the witness and continued as the aggressor in the ensuing struggle. The Court sentenced the accused to three years imprisonment. The accused was not prepared to heed the obvious meaning of the gesture, which was to say, that the defendant was not afraid because he knew the knife would not fit in his hand. The defence evidence established that the defence witness had indicated that the knife was not in the defendant’s hand."
b_1996canlii7148.txt,"A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident. The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued. An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found. A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation. The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act. SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview. It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event. HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.  1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs. Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate. The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke. On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate. The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction. Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate. Estoppel was not applicable. Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act. The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages. These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1). They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4). Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle. As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).  3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear. A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.  4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.","A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased car arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff claimed SGI's assistance to repair the damage to the car and sought reimbursement of the $503.73 deducted for depreciation. The claim was commenced against SGI, pursuant to s. 39 of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The action was abandoned as against the insurer, Saskatchewan Government Insurance. A claim for reinstatement under s. 8(4) of the Act was commenced for $503 for depreciation against SGE. The insurer argued that SGI elected to repair and replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(3) of s.39 of the Automobile Act. HELD: The claim for depreciation was dismissed. The insurance policy was not subject to the statutory condition eight(4). The court found that SGE elected to fix the vehicle and did not elect to reinstate. The court awarded the $502.73 to Crestview for reimbursement of $503 of depreciation. 1)An election to repair is an election. The Court found that the insurer by its conduct may be deemed to have made an election to reinst. However, this was not an election as all the parties agreed to do. An express election is not necessary. An election to replace is an exercise in the purest sense of the word. An honest insurer by his conduct may well be deemed such to have elected to reinstatement. 2)The claim for the loss of the car was commenced by SGI. The automobile was to be registered in the name of Crestview. After the accident, the plaintiff took the vehicle to a repair shop and paid for the replacement of the exhaust. The owner of the vehicle, the insurer elected to replace the car. The defendant then took the car to Woodcrest for repairs. Neither of the parties knew of the damage until it was notified by Crestview of the impounded vehicle. The driver was not aware of the deduction for depreciation until he attended to the vehicle. Thereafter, Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. The issue here is whether SGI estopped from claiming the depreciation. If not, it is not an express election. 3)The Court found it did not observe an express oath or swear an oath. The oath was not signed by the insured. The promise was not acknowledged by the insurer. 4)The court found it could not say that SG is responsible for the entire repair. The test of election is how an insurer makes its election. A reasonable insurer would not elect"
d_2006skqb251.txt,"Hayley is 7 years old. In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her. The father seeks sole custody. The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years. The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests. The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access.","HELD: The Court granted the following reasons: 1) each of the parties competed for some form of custody over their 7 year old daughter. The Court found that the mother and grandmother had chosen to relocate from the City of Calgary to Alberta in order to have their daughter, J. O., take care of her new child. 2) Each party independently sought joint custody with the father. The mother was to have her child born in Alberta in 2006. J.O. and his wife, C. H., moved to Alberta two years ago. C.H. now attends university. C H. now works seven days a week. HELD: 1)'Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The child was to be born in either Alberta or Nova Scotia. The court found that neither of the mother nor the father had any effective communications with either of the respondents. The father had no effective communications skills and information was generally passed through his wife or through his own mother and on to himself. The children were to have one child in their care in the fall of 2006. The parents' relationship deteriorated over time. The daughter had become more withdrawn and sometimes hostile towards her father. It was clear that the father was trying to take the child from his care and move towards a more traditional and more traditional role. The parties were unable to achieve the required result of a consent order. The Mother was awarded sole custody of the child."
d_2003skqb4.txt,"FIAT. The father applied for an order pursuant to the Children's Law Act s.29(1)(a) finding the mother in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of the August 15, 2002 access order. He sought a fine and an order that she bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. He applied to vary the terms of the access order. The Court raised jurisdiction, service and time issues.HELD: 1)To avoid adjournment counsel consented to the court's jurisdiction, the acknowledgement of service and the abridgement of time. 2)The mother was found to be in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the order by repeatedly refusing, without lawful excuse, to comply with its terms. Almost without exception she refused to make the child available for the bi-weekly supervised access visits. She did not abduct the child. The mother was to purge her contempt by paying the father's solicitor and client costs respecting the two applications fixed at $1,500 and by obeying the access terms of this order. The August 15, 2002 order was vacated. 3)The father was to have unsupervised access on alternate weekends. He may bring the child to Saskatchewan but shall not remove her from this province or Manitoba without the mother's written consent. The father shall bear the costs of access with partial reimbursement in the amount of $60 per month, which may be deducted from ongoing child support. He shall give at least seven days notice if he is unable to exercise access. The mother shall have reasonable telephone access.","FIAT The petitioner father applied for an order pursuant to s. 29(1)(a) of The Children's Law Act finding the respondent in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of an August 2002 access order. She sought to restrict access to supervised visits in Manitoba. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt and ordered to pay costs of the application fixed at $1,500 and by obeying the access terms of this order. The limited access proposal of the respondent was not realistic because it virtually guarantees that the petitioner and his parents will never be able to develop any relationship with his son, child that the mother has been supporting financially on a voluntary basis since birth. Nor was the limited access offered by the respondent realistic because the respondent did not have the financial ability to bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. She continued to be held in contempt when she moved with the child without prior notice to the petitioner. The respondent did NOT abduct the child. The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent deliberately disobeyed the court order by repeatedly refusing without lawful excuse to comply with the termsof the order. Almost without exception, she refused to make the child available for the supervised access visits that were ordered every two weeks over a four-month period from August to December 2002. She purported to terminate access and refused to return the child for the remainder of the visits that had been ordered. The court awarded solicitor and client costs of $60 per month."
7_1994canlii4892.txt,"The wife petitioned and the husband counter-petitioned for a division of matrimonial property, custody, access and spousal and child support. HELD: 1)The matrimonial property was valued and divided equally. The wife was permitted to register a caveat to protect the value of her 1/2 interest. If the husband did not arrange payment by September 1st next, the wife was given leave to apply for a sale. 2)The wife was given custody of the 2 children of the marriage.  The court ordered specific access for the husband. 3)The court confirmed the interim support orders made before trial in the amounts of $400.00 per month for the wife, $400.00 per month for the oldest child, and $800.00 per month for the youngest child, who was handicapped.","The issues were custody and access, child and spousal support, division of the matrimonial property and the sale of farm machinery. The wife had from this date a beneficial interest sufficient to support the registration of a caveat in the lands to the extent of $50,000. The RRSP transferred the amount of the benefit it had been paid to the wife to be divided into sections. The Saskatchewan Teachers' Superannuation Commission transferred the sum to an RRSP as may be prescribed by the wife. Upon hearing the parties' evidence, it was of the view that a kind of specified access should be put in place. The farm home is 22 miles from the residence. The property was purchased in 1985 for $75,000 and was used as a home. The value of the farm machinery was $1,600. The land was divided into two sections. An award for retroactive support and maintenance sought by the petitioner must be rejected. The parties were discussing how it should be determined. The respondent had fromthis date a benefit created by the order, sufficient to cover the registration in the first two sections, and the amount payable to the petitioner. The RSP would transfer the sum of $30,000 to an R.R.S.P. as may reasonably be prescribed. The petitioner was not seeking custody of the children but required firm guidelines as to access. The trial judge found that a 'kind of specified' access should possibly be put into place."
2010skqb292.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of organic oats. The contract between the plaintiff and defendant stipulated that the oats were to be delivered at a stipulated moisture content. The defendant accepted the oats from the plaintiff and did not indicate any issue with the moisture content. In turn, the defendant sold the oats to a broker for shipment to Germany. When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation. HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality. The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff. There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff. The resale of the oats to Germany was the defendant's responsibility and the plaintiff is not a party to the contact with the German company. The plaintiff was awarded the balance of the contract price, plus pre-judgment interests and costs.","HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to full payment of the contractual price. The court found that the plaintiff fulfilled his contractual obligations to the defendant and entitled to claim pre-judgment interest. The plaintiff’s position was that although they had done testing of the oats for moisture content as delivered by the plaintiff, that its testing procedures were not in accordance with the Canadian Grain Commission sampling procedures and as result were not verifiable. The documents submitted by the defendant were not admitted into evidence. The issue was whether the plaintiff was required to provide the oats with a quality standard. HELD: There was no evidence that the defendant had adopted the contractual position that the oats were delivered to the plaintiff and were not of the quality standard, nor were they properly marked. The Court found that none of the documents pointing to the failure of the plaintiff”s standard were admitted into support. The issues were whether the defendant was entitled, as the plaintiff had not met his contractual obligation, to provide such oats to the corporate entity that was to pay the plaintiff such a payment, and whether the court could find that the documents were unreliable. The defendant was not seeking pre-judicial interest."

The defendant entered the house in the night and assaulted the complainant when she returned to pick up some clothes. Imposing a sentence of two years eight months, plus a ten year firearm prohibition, that this offence could be categorized as a major sexual assault. The principles of sentencing and the impact on the victim, especially in view of the fact that she was his common-law spouse, made this sentence fit.","The accused was convicted of sexually assaulting his common-law spouse. The offence was contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused had separated from her common- law spouse a few days prior and had been seen by her children. She had called the accused late in the night prior to the offence and said that she did not care if she went to jail for this. The appellant had previously entered the home of a stranger and raped her, despite her struggles to get out of the house. The complainant had also stated that she had been afraid to go to her father's house because she was afraid that she would be found by the police.

d_2013skca22.txt,"The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable.

The parties are disputing MLG's obligations under the CAP. Each party has made an application for directions for directions. The Chambers judge was acting in the capacity as a Chief Administrative Judge in the settlement negotiations. The appellant argues this was a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process meets its overall objective of determining if the amount of MLG's fee is reasonable and equitable. The respondent also argues the Administrative Judge erred in failing to require Deloitte to complete its report and order the report delivered to MLG. The Administrative Judge made no error in failing not to require Canada to supply the redacted electronic billing records to the appellant. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary ordering designed to moving the verificationprocess along and ensuring the process met its overall goal of determining whether the amountof MLG's fees is reasonable or equitable. MLG did not err in failing in failing or failing to obtain information from its internal technology experts on how to reconcile the redacted records. MLG has failed to provide the requested information. The administrative judge made no errors in failing either. The appeal will continue and will add to the cost of proceedings. MLG is not seeking to settle this matter. The court will not allow an appeal to occur because of the impugned order. The leave application is granted.

The judge allowed the application to proceed, over the objections of the mother, and reduced the child support obligation to $1 per month. The mother appealed. Appeal allowed; the judge's decision to allow the application to proceed was procedurally unfair to the appellant and wrong in principle. Only in rare circumstances should a party applying to reduce child support be heard absent that party making full disclosure.","The mother appealed an order which, in response to an application by the father to vary a child maintenance order, reduced his child maintenance obligation to $1.00 per month. The father had never paid any child support voluntarily under the previous order and was in default of the disclosure provision in the original order. He applied to vary the maintenance order to proceed even though he had not made adequate disclosure of his financial situation. HELD: Appeal allowed for reasons of misapprehension, negligence, or lack of disclosure; the court acted in a significant way by allowing the application to proceed and permitting the father's variation application to continue even though it had not attached any income tax information for the 2002 and 2003 years and showed some expenses per year for books and tuition; no income shown was included under the heading 'Gross Salary or Wages or Net Professional Income'.

The mother had given full disclosure to the court in support of her application but the father had filed an incomplete Statement of Financial Information which was 10 months out of date and he was indefault of the disclosed disclosure provision.

The Chambers judge also accepted the respondent's submission that the extent of the immunity of administrative boards and their members from actions such as this based on their alleged malice and bad faith is, as yet, unclear in Canada. Allowing the appeal in part, that the Chambers judge erred when he concluded that all questions of law, including questions where the law is clear, should not be brought before the court in an application to strike, when he concluded that the constitutional question posed by the respondent had not yet been answered by the courts, and when he determined that the extent of the immunity of the appellant Board and its members, except for the Chair, was unclear.

The Chambers judge had held that the respondent had not been properly advised of the extent to which the information contained in the statement of claims could be used to justify an action by the respondent against an employer. The appellant argued that the application should be allowed on three grounds: the application was not made promptly or in time; (delay in bringing the application to court); and (c)there was no abuse of process based on the principle of res judicata.

HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The words spoken by the accused were clearly meant to be taken seriously and implied menace to the listeners. The accused's evidence was disbelieved. His constructed story did not 'hang together'.  2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences. Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility. The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had been familiar with the workings of the criminal justice system which was not a negative inference.","The 29 year old accused his step-sister of uttering a threat to cause death to her and her three children contrary to s. 264.1 of the Criminal Code. The accused had lived on a farm for 64 years and had a very bitter family fight. One of the children had recently passed away and a very bumbling family fight had developed over dealings with and entitlement to the estate. The mother of the accused and one sister had gone bowling with their friend. The father had recently moved into the contracting business and was looking forward to a relaxing life. The younger son suggested that the younger son would take the words 'kill' and 'get rid of' as he said they would be in plastic bags. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court found that the evidence of the convictions was dated and highly prejudicial. The evidence of lack of insight into the past and the probative value of convictions was not relevant. The trial judge was entitled to take into account the evidence as to the admissibility of prior convictions, the weight to be given to the convictions and the credibility of the witnesses."
9_1994canlii7210.txt,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","The defendants were charged with permitting a private building or facility, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village.  The defendants claimed the bylaws of the resort Village were inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under Sec. 15 of the Charter. The charges were based on a misunderstanding of the applicable legislation. The defendants had agreed to allow the development of a boathouse on public reserves, but the proposal was never made public. The boathouses were on public land and the landowner claimed the right to use them as recreation. The City did not act to regulate the construction of the boathole or to protect its claim to the title. The Municipality stepped into that position and refused to prosecute the defendants. The case against the defendant was not new to the Court. It had been a long time since a boating establishment had been permitted on a public reserve. The fact that the condo owners had constructed their boathos on public lands and the fact that it was subject to the provincial bylaw does not change the fact the municipality stepped into the breach. The Court found that the municipality had not done anything to protect the public's right to know about the use of the reserve and, in fact, had been the subject of a considerable amount of litigation. The Defendants were charged for violating the bylaw respecting the use and enjoyment of the public reserve by building their buildings on public property. The defendant was charged with obstruction of a public park or swimming area. The court found that both the plaintiff and the defendant were trespassers. The plaintiff were ordered to pay costs."
b_1995canlii6134.txt,"The Plaintiff commenced these proceedings seeking to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiff's condition related to 2 pre-existing injuries. The only issue which the Court was asked to resolve was whether this accident had caused or contributed to the Plaintiff's injuries. HELD: The question posed was answered in the affirmative. While a normal healthy person might not have been injured in this low speed rear-end collision, the Court was satisfied that, because of the Plaintiff's previous injuries and poor sitting position, the collision did contribute to her current condition in a modest manner.",The 46-year-old female plaintiff sought judgment for damages she suffered as a result of the defendant's negligent operation of the motor vehicle owned by the plaintiff. All of the elements of the plaintiff's claim had been resolved with the exception as to whether the plaintiff suffered injuries caused by the defendant. HELD: The Court held that the causation of the damage was determined based on the evidence and the medical reports of the experts who had reviewed the accident reports and the relevant medical reports. The Court refused to accept the plaintiff expert's opinion as to the cause of the damages. The court questioned the qualifications of each expert and the basis for their respective opinions.
5_2014skpc78.txt,"Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son. The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband. The parties were separated. The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child. After this RCMP were contacted. On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained. During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it. They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach. Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography. The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO. The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above. However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”. When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home. She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house. She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle. During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures. He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs. Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant. Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included. The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her. The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction. The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources. The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model. The purpose of including the information was not made clear. The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore. The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused. Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him. The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?  HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","The accused was charged with sexual assault, sexual touching and invitation to sexual touching. The accused was found to have been performing oral sex on her 8-year-old son while he was taking photographs of her. The search was conducted on a laptop computer. The evidence obtained was that the accused had been viewing pictures of herself in a computer room while an adult took photographs of the occurrence. The defence argued that the information obtained was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 7(b) of the Charter and that evidence obtained should be excluded. The Court distinguished between the accused's evidence obtained as a result of the search and information contained therein concerning her son and her history of unsubstantiated complaints against him. The ITO did not allege the commission of the offence or creation of child pornography but only of invitation to sex. The same inference could be made by looking at pictures of the accused in a different way and finding that the pictures were of a more serious offence. The court found that the use of a computer to search for pictures of a child and her son was not relevant as it did not differentiate information and belief as to whether the pictures came from the child's own sources or from third parties. The conclusion that the ITO could not, in the form presented, support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially was granted. The trial continued and the accused was given leave to appear at her residence. She was not permitted to change her clothes or get dressed. The application of the Defence was voir dire, conducted at the application of Queen's Bench. The Crown did not appear to be presenting evidence that might support the issues raised by the warrant. The Office of the Queen's Counsel was not present at the trial. The issue of whether the ITOs could not support the Issue of the Warrant by a Justice acting judiciously was not addressed. The ONCA decision in R. v. Vu, 2011 ONCA 632 (3d) 7, was not established. The portion of the voir-dire that allowed the Court to determine the validity of the issue was not raised by this issue but by a procedural issue which allowed the court to determine whether the warrant had been issued. The voir de dire was conducted at Queen's Bancorp and was adjourned for conduct of voir. The purpose of the trial was to determine if the warrant met the requirements set out in the ITOA and whether it was valid to issue a search warrant to the accused. The administration of justice"
b_2003skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son. The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application. However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered. The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will. The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.  1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business. The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools. The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss. The 'disappointed beneficiary' principle was applicable in this case.","The plaintiff claims that the mutual fund ought never to have formed part of his father's estate. It was his father’s intention to name him as beneficiary of the fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendants gave notice of intention to cross-examine on the affidavits. HELD: The plaintiff’S cause of action was as a result of the defendant’d negligence in naming the fund as a beneficiary. Garry Mayer had cause of Action as a disappointed beneficiary and that he suffered damages as a consequence of the negligence. The claim against the defendant was dismissed. 1)The defendant was not a chartered life insurance company and the fact that the deceased purchased an annuity life policy through Nordstrom for a lump sum premium of $60,000, naming Garry as its beneficiary, it was incumbent on him to ensure that Mayer’ed objective was achieved. That duty was breached when Nordstrom failed to realize that the Trimark fund would not recognize a designated beneficiary or alternatively, by his failure to recommend that the investment be made in the joint names of Mayer and Garry, or in his decision not to place before Mayer known alternate investment vehicles in which the beneficiary designation would be effective. 2)The plaintiff suffered damages from the defendant for pre-judgment interest from the date of death of Mayer to the date that judgment was payable and his costs to be taxed. 3)The defendants were named as a defendant. No evidence was led against them or the claim against it and the claim was dismissed without order as to costs for or against it. As it was represented concurrently with Nordstrom, there was no order as a costs for the costs for either party."
b_2002skqb72.txt,"Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278. He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time. The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies. He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit. The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time. Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans. The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans. At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001. HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines. Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a). The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees. The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs. The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay. Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month. The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.  3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance. The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2). A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald. It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. 4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due. If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750.","The parties sought to vary the existing child support order. They have two children, aged 21 and 18. Under the terms of the order, the respondent was paying child support in the amount of $987 per month on the basis of an income of $80,278. The second child, aged 18, was attending university. HELD: 1) The respondent failed to obtain the required level of support which was required of him. The Table amount of support awarded for both children was $1,153 per month based on his income of approximately $80k. The respondent was to pay $5,000 per month as child support based upon his income. The table amount of supported awarded for the two children was not to be determined solely on the terms prescribed by the applicable Table. 2) The Table amounts of support were awarded for each child based upon their income. 3) The petitioner's direct food and shelter expenses were $18,000. The overall household expenditures were greater. The parties' ability to contribute adequately to their food, shelter and related expenses when not in attendance at school was not a major issue. 4) The parties were demonstrating the respondent's ability to obtain reasonably remunerative summertime employment that they were not dependent upon their parents during the summer months and had the ability to contributing adequately to food, food, and related expense when not attending school. The petitioner was attending the University of Calgary. She was attending classes part-time. The tables amount of child support awarded were $1 million. 5) The respondents were awarded $611 per month in child support payments based upon the respondent earning $7,200 per year. The amount of arrears was reduced to $718 per month for the months of July and August, 1999 and July 2001. The court declined to find the respondent in error. 6) The Court was satisfied that the respondent misapplied s. 3(2) of the Guidelines. The Court ordered an order based upon $1.153 per child support payable by the respondent based upon an income in excess of $60,000 for the school year. It was the Court's position that the children's needs did not increase with their age. The cost of maintaining the home for the children was high. The respondents' income was determined by applying the Canada and Saskatchewan Student Loans totalling $8,784 for the 2001 school year and consisted of monthly living allowance of $504 and $5k for tuition, books and dormitory fees. The funds advanced to the petitioner's daughter were not sufficient"

Counsel for the plaintiffs and the defendant granted leave to speak to the matter. The defendant submits that the young persons were victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted by senior students, including the plaintiffs. The plaintiff seeks costs. HELD: The order is at the top of the range of protections which the court may afford to individuals in our society and the onus is on the applicant to establish on a continuing basis that this remedy is required. The affidavits contain significant personal injury and psychological harm to the plaintiffs, their families and others. The assaults and related proceedings have already generated strong emotions on all sides.

The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence. The defendants, carrying on business as a hauling sub-contractor to Tri-Link, reported a cheque drawn on the plaintiff bank as lost. Tri-Link issued a replacement cheque. The first cheque was certified at a bank branch of the plaintiff in Alberta and deposited to the defendants' credit union account. Default judgments were obtained in January/March 1997 against the defendants who now sought to have them set aside pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 346 and 173(a). The defendants claimed the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action as a certified cheque is irrevocable and as such any default judgment may be set aside ex debito justitiae, in which case delay in bringing the application is not factor. The plaintiff claims it has a cause of action in either conversion or mistake of fact/unjust enrichment. HELD: The defendants' motion was dismissed as the plaintiff's statement of claim adequately disclosed a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment.  1)There are exceptions to the irrevocable nature of a certified cheque. The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of a certified cheque as payment did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants in this instance had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. The cerified cheque did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants had already received payment for their services.  2)In recognizing exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certification the commercial utility of certification at the request of the payee is maintained while providing recourse to a bank where a payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of a certified cheque.","The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment entered by the plaintiff against them and have the plaintiff's claim struck out.

1991canlii2445.txt,"This was an appeal from a judgment refusing to gram certiorari and other relief following findings by the respondent disciplinary panel that the appellant was guilty of professional misconduct. The appellant sought declaratory relief or relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter. Dismissing the appeal that (1) the Charter has no application to this self-regulating body; (2) the panel was properly constituted in accordance with the respondent's by-laws; (3) the panel acted within its jurisdiction; (4) there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the panel members; (5) the panel complied with the rules of natural justice, and (6) the trial judge, in refusing to grant certiorari, made no errors in so concluding.","The appellant was a branch manager of an investment dealer, who at times was the regional manager of another branch office, and who at other times was involved in business dealings with the federal cabinet minister. The charges involved disclosure of information about the blind trust of federal cabinet Minister, taking part in'side deals' (trades) in securities not approved by his head office and failing to ensure proper records were kept of the side deals. The trustee was suspended for two years, fined $50,000 and ordered to pay costs of $65,000. At issue was whether the Board's findings of fact were wrong, whether the by-laws of the business conduct committee applied, if there was a breach of the trustee's by-law, if the trustee was aware of the memoranda, if he had read them, if they had been in the books of the member, if any, and if the Board had any jurisdiction at all. The appellant argued that the Board acted unreasonably and in bad faith in charging him with infractions in charges (i) and (iii) that were clearly not his responsibility. Dismissing the appeal, that the panel's findings were well within the duty and jurisdiction of a disciplinary board."
d_2006skqb35.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.","HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that the Court could not conclude that the aggravated and punitive damages would fail as against the remaining defendants. The Court ordered that the plaintiffs provide full and complete responses to written interrogatories and, if necessary, be orally examined on their responses. The application was adjourned sine die. The court ordered that further examination of the plaintiff's performance would be ordered in order to determine her level of skill. The Judge found that the expert evidence in the field could not be used as a basis for an appropriate finding. The judge also found that there was no evidence that the plaintiff had taken any remedial measures to improve her performance during her time in the hospital. The plaintiff was not required to respond to written questions."
e_2008skqb192.txt,"FIAT: A previous interim order detailed specific access in the period leading up to pre-trial or trial, however more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial. The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order. HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.  The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children. The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order.","FIAT: The access issue has come before the Court twice. In February 2007 the Court issued a fiat that specified custody and access. In April it ordered that the petitioner have access every weekend, every third weekend, overnight to Tuesday at 10:00 a.m., and every fourth weekend from Friday at 4:00 p.m. to Tuesday in the evening at 10;00 a.""m. The fiat did not address the fact that the respondent would be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The request to specify access this summer is in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order. It does not address that the petition would be temporarily laid off during the spring or summer holidays. HELD: 1) The Court found no evidence that there had been a material change in circumstances or that altering the existing regular access schedule would be in the best interests of the children. 2) The access order in issue was an interim one. The Court was unable to find any material change that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access. The Order in issue is an interim order. The order in question is an order relating to access. It shall be enforced by the RCMP or other peace officer. The petitioner shall have access for two non-consecutive periods consisting of no more than five overnights each.  3) The fiat was meant only to cover the gap between the application and pre-trial or trial, which certainly ought to have occurred before Christmas, 2007. The court tried to disrupt the lives of the young children as little as possible and adopted the status quo subject always to that arrangement being in the interests of The Court's Bench. 4) Applications to alter interim access orders are not the answer. Moving the matter quickly to pre- trial is not the way forward."
c_2014skqb31.txt,"Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it. The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants. SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance. The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation. The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs. Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured. The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success. The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material. The improper material included information on settlement discussions.","FIAT: The real issue in this application is whether Saskatchewan Mutual Insurance Company (SMI) was in a special relationship of insurer with the plaintiffs that carried a duty of good faith and fair dealing. The plaintiffs are policy holders of SMI's policy of insurance. This policy is not an issue in the action commenced by the plaintiffs and is not relied on for coverage in respect of the claim. HELD: 1) The application is dismissed. The case for punitive damages is dismissed along with the other claims. 2) The only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from all of the action is that the plaintiff's statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action. 3) The facts as stated in the statement of claims can be found to be plain and obvious that the plaintiffs' statement of claimed discloses nothing reasonable cause for action. There is no evidence that this is the case in all of these cases. 4) The real issues in this case are whether Saskatchewan mutual insurance (SGI) was a special person of insurance with the plaintiff that carried the duty of fair dealing and whether it is entitled to indemnify the plaintiffs for losses not underwritten in the policy. In addition, the Court would have to distinguish between a true case of denying contractual obligations known to exist and a bona fide dispute over the extent of liability."
9_2016skpc123.txt,"HELD: The Charter application was granted. The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights had been breached. After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view. The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence. Regarding the impaired driving charge, the accused was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with breach of s. 8 of the Charter by failing to provide a sample of her breath to enable analysis to be made by means of an approved screening device. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on all of the counts. The Court of Appeal affirmed in Rogers the trial judge’s decision that this search was found to be unreasonable and therefore breach of Section of the Code. The Crown asserted that the essential elements of this charge were: the evidence of driving, the presence of a vehicle with a registration plate and the presence or absence of a child in it. The accused’ s. 7 Charter rights were violated. The evidence was conclusive. The court found that the accused was not impaired and the officer had no reasonable grounds to make an improved screening device on her. The voir dire was considered. The officer was acquitted of all charges. The appeal court found the accused not guilty of impaired driving. The police officer was attending to conduct a search for evidence when she knocked on the door of the accused”s residence. The door was unlocked and the accused opened the door and, while the two remained on either side of the door, she opened the window and peered inside. The occupant of the home answered. The complainant had just walked out of her home and was not able to recognize her. There was a young child standing in front of the complainant” s. 5 window. The appellant had walked around inside the house and was able to observe the complainant as she put the child in the car seat and watched her. Finally, the appellant had entered the home without consent or invitation and following the complainant around the house so she did not lose eye contact with her. At the conclusion of the trial the court noted that the police officer”d not have obtained a warrant to enter the house. The unreasonable search contrary to ss. 8 and 9 affected the accused and her privacy, liberty and human dignity. The Police officer’d accompanying her around the home and the actions outside of the house in full public view in a residential neighbourhood were serious. The implied invitation to knock extends no further than is required to permitvenient communication with the occupant. The refusal to provide samples is also an issue. The issues are fact based. The case law and the approach taken by the police in this case was very different from that in other cases. The findings of the voir and"

HELD: 1) The Court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether to grant an application for severance.  In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to Walbaum's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four separate trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.  2) The plaintiffs acknowledge that only relatively small portion of trial time (perhaps less than 1 day) will pertain to the claims against any one of the Sims, Gabriel or Dumurs. It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them. Specific dates and times should be set aside for the plaintiff to call evidence with respect to its claims against each applicant group. The applicants should be relieved from attending the trial at any other time.","FIAT. The plaintiff brings a class action against nine defendants. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants were involved in the divestiture of assets by the Walbaum Group. The defendants are equal partners in the defendant. The relationship between the two shareholders broke down and in November 1997, the defendant was ordered liquidated. Thereafter, the main defendant carried on business as the sole shareholder of the defendant, which was based in the city. The defendant diverted virtually all of its assets to himself, his companies (All-Rite Plumbing, and Tamwal Investments), and his wife. The issues before the court are the facts and circumstances of the case and the legal issues surrounding the plaintiffs' claim against the Walbbaum Group are different from the legal issue supporting the individual claims against the Sims, Gabriel and Dumurs. HELD: 1) The defendants bring separate motions pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 41(a) for severance of the claims against them or for orders staying the claims until the plaintiffs’ claims against The Walbaum group have been decided.  2) The court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether the grant an application for severances. In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to the Walba Group’s dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbe Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense. 3) The parties’ differing opinions on severance are not confined to severance or stays of proceedings. Other options are available to ensure that all of these issues are tried in a manner that minimizes unnecessary prejudice and expense to all parties. 4) The plaintiffs oppose the applications on the basis that the claims are small in scope and the fact that they would require less time and effort to adduce than the claims of the other defendants. They also argue that the court will consider the fact of the fact the applicants would most likely to require more time and money than the defendants. In Potash Corp. v. Allendale Mutual Insurance Co. (1989), a Queen’S Bench Rule 296 order stated that: 1. The court would look at the facts of the larger action against the Wbaum Group and the issues before it. They would require that the applicant, the plaintiffs, designate 21 days for each of"
b_1995canlii5809.txt,"FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee. The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer. The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction. The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination. The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'. The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay. HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable. If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness. 3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise. The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness. 4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule. The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct. 5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing.","FIAT. An application for judicial review of an arbitration award by a three-person panel which reinstated the respondent as an employee following his termination as anemployee in 1992. The respondent took the position that the 1992 agreement was a last chance agreement as it would allow him to attend a substance abuse treatment program, but also provided conditions for his return to work, including alcohol counselling, abstinence from alcohol, attendance at AA meetings and a two week sentence at St. Louis University. The Board found the penalty of discharge excessive, especially when coupled with the respondent's years of seniority and previous disciplinary record. Therefore the respondent was to be reinstated to his former position immediately. The period from August 1993 to the date that this Award was to expire was treated as a suspension without pay for 16 months. HELD: 1)The Board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was correct. The standard of review applicable to arbitrators, appointed on an ad hoc basis to decide a dispute arising under a collective agreement, and labour relations boards responsible for overseeing the ongoing interpretation of legislation and development of labour relations policy and precedent within a given labour jurisdiction were reviewed. 2)The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents."
c_2018skqb29.txt,HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the applicant had not proven that there was a material change in circumstances as voluntary early retirements do not constitute material change of circumstance. It ordered the respondent to immediately proceed to complete an application to split the applicant’s CPP credits.,"FIAT: The applicant/petitioner applied for a variation of an interim order issued by the Court in August 2007.

The applicant also sought to vary the amount of spousals ordered by the order based upon his now declared intention to take early retirement.

Section 7 childcare expenses are to be shared pro rata. 3) The Court declined to order interim spousal support as the Court was not satisfied that the respondent had the existing ability to pay it. 4) The issues regarding retroactive child support, ongoing child support, access and spousal support were directed to pre-trial conference. 5) Costs of $1,500 were awarded to the petitioner and payable no later than May 31, 2011.","HELD: The Court held that it did not believe that the respondent had the existing ability to pay child support. On a review of the issues of parenting and support, it found that it was not in the children's best interests to change the interim access order made in August, either by restricting access or by enlarging it. Those questions were best left for trial where full and complete evidence and issues of credibility could be considered and adjudicated.

6_1991canlii4510.txt,"This was an application by the plaintiff vendors for a declaration that an objection to title raised by the defendant purchasers was without merit. For the plaintiffs, that the Vendors and Purchasers Act can be used to establish possessory title, and the plaintiffs had succeeded in demonstrating 'open, notorious and continuous possession' of the property for over 40 years. The possibility of a claim by the Crown under the Escheats Act was ruled so remote as to be frivolous.","The vendors and their predecessors in title, namely the Bentley heirs and their successors in title and the Sisters, by open, open, and continuous possession since 1946, a period in excess of 44 years, have established a good and marketable possessory title to the lot in question. The Sisters, in their own right, have maintained a garden area adjoining the house and their residence has been continuously occupied by the Sisters. The case law for proving possessory ownership is Limitation of Actions (LAA) c.258 R.S.N.S., 1989. Objection to title sought on the basis of the evidence submitted that the vendors and/or their predecessors (the Bentleys) by open and continuous possessory possession since at least 1946, A period in over 44 years have established A good and Marketable possessORY title to this lot. HELD: 1)Even if found that possessory titles had been established by the required proof of possession for more than 40 years this would not defeat a claim by the Crown under the Escheats Act against whom such possession must be proved for a period of at least 60 years. 2)The evidence submitted by the vendors/plaintiffs was so remote as to be frivolous and as such is not a valid objection to title."
d_2006skpc95.txt,"The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.","The accused was found to be a dangerous offender pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied for a remand for assessment pursuant to ss. 752.1 of the Code, presenting materials indicating that a qualified expert would be qualified to provide the Court with the necessary assessment. The matter was adjourned to permit the expert to complete his assessment. HELD: The Court held that on a dangerous or long-term offender application, the Court must consider whether the Court has found the offender a long- term offender, despite the fact that the requirements of s.753 have been met. The Court proposed to review the applicable law at the outset, given that there were significant amendments to Part XXIV of the code in 1997 which have been interpreted by both the Supreme Court of Canada and the Court of Appeal, and given the unusual nature of this sentencing procedure. The statutory requirements for finding a dangerous person are found in s.730(1) of the C Code. There must be evidence of treatability that is more than an expression of hope and that indicates that the specific offender can be treated. This is especially true in borderline cases, where the offender has been previously found to have been a long term offender."
2_2009skqb516.txt,"In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals. In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR). Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH). The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH. The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts. The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies. HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for. The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.  2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue. It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH. The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA). While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act. The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings. The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer. The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer. The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered. They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.","The plaintiff corporation carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. The defendant corporation entered dealership agreements with equipment suppliers. The plaintiff entered into a priority agreement with the defendant corporation that granted the defendant corporations credit on the security of present and after-acquired product. The defendants made several unsuccessful business applications to the court, claiming that the priority agreement was invalid because the names of the suppliers were not included in the inventory of the plaintiff corporation and the defendants refused to supply parts to the plaintiff. The issues were as follows: 1) the priority was given to the applicant security over the security offered by the third party suppliers; 2) the defendants were required to pay certain amounts as set out in the priority agreements; 3) the plaintiff was entitled to terminate the appointment of PwC as receiver and manager on all of the defendants' assets and liabilities pursuant to s. 5 of the Bankruptcy Act and s. 6 of the Trade in Goods Act; and 4) the contractual provisions clearly entitle the defendant to refuse to restock direct ship parts. The contractual provisions in the respective priority agreements clearly entitle plaintiff to refuse, but only pursuant to the provisions of s. 50(2) of the Agricultural Implements Act and the corporate policy of CNH Canada to refuse restock indirect ship parts (the 'Report'). The contractual provision that the supplier is to have priority over the sales of goods supplied by the other vendors (the Direct Ship Items) served to override the contrary contractual provisions. The Court rejected the plaintiff's objection, relying on the SCC decision in Andersen (Arthur) Inc. v. Merit Energy Ltd., 227 Sask. R. 44. The parties stand as successors to the respective contracting parties and have assumed their respective rights and obligations relating to the TD priority agreements. The case in which the defendant companies objected to the propriety of a court-appointed receiver taking the side of a competing creditor in a priority dispute amongst creditors. In the context in which this was a collateral matter, this was no way to supply part inventory more quickly. The court found that the parties were acting on behalf of all creditors to determine priority between competing claimants. That is not the same as the Receiver seeking to change the priorities as between the respective claimants. Parts and service manuals returned by the defendant returned to the defendant company that were used exclusively for servicing the supplier's products. The fact that the defendant vendors' names and equipment were included in a separate set of credits indicates that parts are something separate or different. The word 'parts' must be interpreted to include"

In 1997, the plaintiffs first learned through other family members that the defendant, a nephew of the deceased, had revealed to them that it was actually he who was the driver of the car at the time of the accident. They brought an action under the provisions of the Fatal Injuries Act. This was an application to disallow the limitation defence raised by Judgment Recovery on behalf of the defendant. Dismissing the application without costs, that the limitation as prescribed by the Act is twelve months, which the plaintiffs had clearly exceeded. This time period is without regard to the injured party's knowledge of whether or not a claim exists.","The plaintiffs sued the defendant based on a claim that he was the driver of the vehicle that killed their pregnant daughter 25 years earlier. The defendant had filed a statement of claim for the relief of a limitation defence on the basis that it was made after the death of their uncle 25 years ago. The mother of two daughters applied to have the defence dismissed on the grounds that the claim was not pleaded in the Statement of Claim nor was there anything approaching a satisfactory evidentiary basis upon which the claim for fraudulent concealment could be made out. Application to disallow the defence of limitation dismissed; the plaintiff had made no inquiries to the defendant or the police as to how this accident happened and had only made a brief inquiry to her father several months after the accident. She had no further information as to her identity. The plaintiff's application to disallowed the defence was dismissed because, in the peculiar circumstances of this case, the plaintiff failed to establish that they were entitled to rely on the application of the fraudulent concealments principle."
c_1998canlii13533.txt,"FIAT. An application to vary maintenance for two children under the Federal Child Supprt Guidelines. At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d). The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields. He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October. He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work. The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated. HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month. 1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income. The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997. Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past. No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years. The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded. In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable. The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck. The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children. His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine. 2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school in Manitoba, why the expense was necessary in relation to the child's best interest and whether the child had any means to contribute. Leave was given to return the matter to the Court with the appropriate supporting materials.  3)No order as to costs.","FIAT. An application to vary maintenance under the Child Support Guidelines in respect of two children. The father had been employed for 5 years at the time of the birth and in 1997 at the mine, earning $27,600 per annum. HELD: 1)The father's income from 1995 to the current date is determined to be $2700 per annus. The mother has set out a reasonable basis for disallowing certain expenses. The claim for gas and repairs is overstated by $3,000 in comparison to the three previous taxation years. There are $3 million in capital payments ($2,233 for the current crop year) and $2,232 for farm expenses. 2)The farm income will be adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for this year. The farm income should be determined by projecting his income at straight wages until October 15, 1998 thereby giving recognition to the possibility of lay-off and the reduction in overtime. 3)There was no evidence why the child attended high school there, why the expense isnecessary in relation to the child's best interests or whether the child has any means to contribute to the expense. The only evidence was that the mother received accounting advice and submitted in evidence to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount qualifying for the deductibility of the deduction. 4)The claim was refused but with leave to return the issue to Court with appropriate supporting materials."
c_2013skpc94.txt,"A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children's mother was deceased and their father indicated that he was unable to meet his children's needs. The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children. They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated. The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access. The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister. HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b). The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change. The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister. The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father.","The agency applied for a long term order under s.37(3) of the Child and Family Services Act (the Act) and for an order that the current foster parents be declared as persons having a sufficient interest in all three children under s.(23) and (37) under s(1)(b) ofthe Act granting them custody. The Agency initially applied for and received an order under ss.37 and 37(1) of that Act for each child to be placed in the custody of the person of sufficient interest, which effectively means they will remain in the care of the Agency for a period of 3 years. The agency then applied for an Order declaring each child as persons of sufficient Interest pursuant to s.31 of the Act and an order for an additional order granting them joint custody. HELD: 1)Each child was in need of protection pursuant to ss.11(b) and s.35 of the act. 2)It was important that the children continue to have sense of security in their placement and continuity in their lives. It would be beneficial for each of the children to remain together as a family unit to the extent possible. 3)Each party was to have access on a written basis."

In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month. The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive. HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.  1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court. In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2) The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met. If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3) By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him. The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her. There was no justification for the payment to continue. It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her.","FIAT: The respondent applies to vary his February 28, 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 1, 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for August 2004. The issue of whether these orders should be made retroactive was reserved. HELD: 1) The Court has jurisdiction to vary support orders pursuant to the Divorce Act. The Court prefers the approach taken by the British Columbia Court of Appeal. They note that the British Columbian Court of appeal did not refer to the impact of the Guidelines on retroactive support but rather to the effect of the legislation. 2) The British Columbia court of appeal does not directly refer to this issue. The Alberta Court of appeals does. 3) The case law clearly states that the presumption in favour of retroactive child support lies within the Court's discretion and there is no provisions that indicate how that discretion is to be exercised."
2_2010skqb444.txt,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence. On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act as am. He applies for an order excluding evidence of cocaine found in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter of Rights were violated. This decision follows voir dire held to determine the admissibility of the evidence. HELD: The evidence must be excluded. 1) The accused was unusually nervous. He asserted that his hand was trembling as he handed over his documents, that his face was trembling, his eyes were puffy and he did not display any emotion of the sort that would normally attract a police dog. 2) The evidence was excluded from the search of the motor home as a result of his rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure under s. of the charter. The accused did not raise any concerns with respect to his rights as a person of the legal age. 3) The motor home was extensively modified to facilitate the transportation of illegal drugs. The plumbing and holding tank systems had been disabled, walls had been moved and secret compartments were created, and hydraulics with switching system had been installed to provide access to the compartments. The smell of marijuana and black plastic bags containing bricks of cocaine were found in the interior of the vehicle. The motorhome was extensively altered to facilitate transportation of drugs. During the search, the police officers observed vehicles weaving from one end of the road to the other and noticed that there were two large piles of plastic bags in the middle of the roadway. The plastic bags were found under the seat where the duffle bag had been placed. The police officers used a mobile work station to locate the vehicle and made name inquiries on police databases. The vehicle was parked on the shoulder of the highway near where the search was conducted. The vehicles were equipped with windshield view video cameras and audio recording devices. The evidence of the accused's right to counsel and his right to remain silent were not excluded under ss.(8, 9, 10 and 10) of The Charter.

The policy did not cover the periods he would be in Saskatchewan where he ordinarily resided with his parents.

He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA. MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy. The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary. They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb.

Therefore the plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for the surgery. 2)The exclusionary clause did not exempt MSI from liability for payment.

The definition of a 'pre-existing' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation to pay.

The Court held that the definition of such a 'Pre-existing Condition' is unclear and does do not operate as relieve MSI from its obligation under the policy to extend the benefits to Huddersfield resident for surgery. The Plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for surgery as the condition pre-existed the effective date of the policy when the pneumothoria occurred. The application for judgment for the sum of $26.864.48 prayed for in this cause together with tax.  1)The definition of 'pre -existing condition' is a complicated one which does not function to relieve the insurer of its obligations to pay and 2)The application for costs to tax was dismissed.

2008skqb287.txt,"The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case. The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.","The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the Minister's care until each child turned 18 years.

The questions are: 1) are the children's parents; 2) the mother has some medical problems; 3) the father is ill; 4) the child is severely disabled; 5) there is no adult person who is able and willing to provide for the children with the services that they require. The father is in poor health; 6) the evidence is inconclusive; 7) the children have significant needs as they cannot speak or follow a diet; 8) the parents have separated; 9) the issues are complex and the children need the most care and attention. The evidence is incomplete and there is a serious question to be tried."

Dismissing the application, that there was insufficient evidence to indicate there would be a violation of an essential of justice if the parties were excluded from hearing each other's testimony. The only evidence before the court was that the lines of questioning of each grandchild would be identical. This was insufficient to displace a party's inherent right to attend his co-party's discovery.","The estate was devastated by a motor vehicle accident. The estate sought exclusion from the discovery examination and other examinations.

HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff. 1)The Plaintiff had been diagnosed as suffering from severe psychological problems as a result of the sexual assaults. 2)The Court assessed the Plaintiff's non-pecuniary damages at $50,000.00 and apportioned 80% of this sum or $40,000.00 to the step-father. 3)The Plaintiff was also awarded $25,000.00 in punitive damages as against the stepfather.","The defendant was the step-father of the plaintiff. He pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of sexually assaulting her. He was sentenced to ten months imprisonment. The plaintiff commenced an action against him claiming damages as a result of the sexual assaults. A. did not defend the action.HELD: 1)The plaintiff suffered damage to her self-esteem and self-confidence as a consequence of the assaults. The assaults were severe and caused her pain and suffering. She will continue to suffer for an appreciable period of time. 2)The court determined that the discrepancies between the amounts awarded by various courts in sexual assault cases could not be reconciled. The court focused on pain and suffered, emotional distress and loss of amenities. She suffered psychological trauma and loss from the assaults, primarily from her uncle. She was unable to form appropriate relationships with her husband. 3)The psychological trauma which she had undergone was severe. She would continue to suffering for an extended period of years.

c_2007skpc41.txt,"The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then. The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification? HELD: The accused is not guilty. 1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2) The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time. Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later. At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief. Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer. As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 89(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused indicated that the motor vehicle accident occurred at time when he was still believing that he had a valid provisional driver’s license. Pursuant to a letter from S.G.I. confirming that, as a result of a roadside suspension on December 18, 2005, his driver”s license was suspended until October 16, 2006 and until he had completed the required education or recovery program. Unfortunately, he had not received the letter until subsequent to the motor car accident in issue. HELD: The accused was acquitted. The Court applied the principles in McKenzie (P.N.) (1995), [1] and (R. v. Kraftchick), (2006), [2) to the accused. While not having heard from SG. I. in the interim, it was reasonable for the accused to rely on the advice received from the peace officer.

7_1999canlii3285.txt,"The plaintiff was injured as a result of a motor vehicle accident. The defendant was found liable. At issue was the claim of the plaintiff against the defendant's insurer for Section B benefits. The defendant paid benefits for 129 weeks. It claimed that the plaintiff misrepresented her employment status at the time of the accident, and that the benefits should be re-paid. The plaintiff argued in response that the defendant was estopped from claiming repayment. Ordering the benefits be re-paid, that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation, on the basis of representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff, to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it. It would be illogical to prevent the defendant from getting its money back when it is found that the benefits were paid on the basis of faulty information provided by the plaintiff. This is not a situation in which estoppel lies against the defendant.","The common law wife of the insured, started an action against the defendants, the owner of the defendant's vehicle and the insurer of the plaintiff's insurance policy. The insurance company claimed that the plaintiff was doing housekeeping for its insured, when the accident occurred. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had paid her $360 per week for 40 hours weekly on the basis of misinformation provided by her common law husband, some of which were confirmed by the plaintiff. The defendant claimed that this was her job. The court found that the insurance company did not provide any evidence as to employment at the time of the accident, and that the claim of unpaid wages was not based on the plaintiff having no income at the date of the incident and that she had not shown any interest in claiming repayment of the money it had paid to her under Schedule B. The Court awarded the plaintiff $140 per week as general damages, plus costs of the action, to the defendant. The plaintiffs claim against the insurance companies for repayment of monies paid under Schedule 'B' that were lost due to the plaintiff failing to indicate any interest or interest in taking part in the job. This is an arms length problem for the plaintiff who faces a problem that is not impossible to produce. The defendants acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation on the information provided by the parties to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent. The administration of the monies was expeditious and the defendant did not meet the onus of proving employment at that time."
d_2004nsfc13.txt,"The mother was unable to care for the child and the father, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was only entitled to supervised access. Both the paternal and maternal grandmothers presented plans of care to the court, with the paternal grandmother seeking custody and the maternal grandmother seeking care and control of the child. The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother. The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody. The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them.","The mother, who lives with the maternal grandmother, plans to have the child placed in the permanent care of the paternal grandmother, who will be responsible for the child's nutrition and physical well-being. The father, who is a convicted child abuser, has been sentenced to thirty-nine months in prison as a result of his conviction. He has been in the temporary care and custody of the agency for thirty-three months. The mother, T.S., who lives in the Halifax area, has three other children of her own. The maternal grandmother lives in a two bedroom apartment in Halifax. HELD: The child is placed in permanent care and Custody of the maternal and paternal grandmother. The matter will be dismissed pursuant to s. 42(1)(a) of the Children and Family Services Act. 1) The mother has not made an application under the Maintenance and Custodial Act but because the issues before the court are the parenting plans of both grandmothers, she will be joined as a party to the proceeding started by the maternal granddaughter under the maintenance and custody act. 2) The evidence is conclusive that the child is in need of protective services. The evidence does not support the agency plan. The court reviewed the cases of three other grandmothers who had similar children of the relationship. The paternal grandmother lived in a one bedroom apartment with her husband and their two children. The oldest child lived with his maternal grandmother in a smaller apartment. The biological grandmother lived with her sister in Halifax and their children had one child, who lived with the paternal grandparent. The child was better set up in her home to receive the child and the maternal grandparent indicated that she would move to a larger residence if she got custody."
3_1999canlii2586.txt,"One of the residual legatees of the respondent estate filed a petition under s. 31(1) of the Probate Act. At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.' The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act. The executor appealed. He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding. This was also one of those rare occasions where solicitor and client costs on the appeal were warranted, as the executor's actions amounted to a serious dereliction of duty which the Court termed reprehensible and unconscionable.","The appellant appealed the May 1999 probate decision dismissing his application to have costs to be awarded on a solicitor and client basis. The solicitor had practised law for over 40 years before retirement and had made a number of specific bequests, including a bequest of $50,000 to her niece and $10,000 for Zion Lutheran Church. The will was submitted to probate in 1997 and received a final order in 1998 that all estate money be paid into an estate bank account. Counsel for the appellant had requested that the appeal be dismissed with costs to the respondent and the Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church separately. The appellant had made no opposition to the order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the costs to a solicitor on a fixed scale, fixed and payable forthwith.  1) With respect to costs on this appeal, it is relevant to consider the matters that gave rise to the appeal. The grounds of appeal are without merit, indeed, without any modicum of merit. The appeal is brought for the sole purpose of delaying the legatees from pursuing their legitimate rights. As such, this proceeding is an abuse of the appeal process. 2) The appeal has been dismissed with solicitor and clients awarded to the respondents and the respondent Zion Evangelicals Lutheran Church personally. 3) Costs to be paid forthwith by the appellant to the registrar are to be directed forthwith, but the matter of costs respecting the hearing before Justice Carver is left to the determination of Justice Carvers."

The landlord also appealed the order of the Hearing officer ordering the landlord pay the tenants $225 as abatment of rent. The Landlord argued the landlord was not responsible for the utilities and was not entitled to accept all of the evidence told to her by any witness. HELD: The Landowner's ground of appeal related to the findings of fact made by the Hearing Office. The tenant's ground was that the hearing officer was wrong in her decision on the facts. The landowner's argument that the court erred in its jurisdiction was that it was open to the Hearing Hearing Officer to accept some of theevidence of particular witness and not other evidence of that witness. The Hearing Officer was not bound to accept only the evidence of particular witnesses and not only other evidence that that witness but also other witnesses too were accepted. The Court dismissed the appellant's findings of facts based on the factual findings of law and the facts of fact.

d_2013skpc206.txt,"HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance.","The plaintiff puts forward that he loaned $5,000 to the defendants, with an additional $1,000 being paid to the plaintiff. The defendants were living in the plaintiff's home with their wife and children. The plaintiff claims that she received the $1k000 cheque, cheque number 16733, and simply was asked to sign it and return it. The defendant claims that the $2,000 was paid to repay the plaintiff for expenses related to her bringing the girl to Canada. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is adjourned for a date to be determined by the parties and the Court.  1) There is no loan given to the defendant. There is nothing to indicate that matters were not amiable, between the defendants and the plaintiff, as there is no documentation prepared and/or signed to show the repayment of the advance. 2) The defendant testified that he received the money from the plaintiff shortly after the statement of claim was issued. He did not name the plaintiff as to what he asked or did. The statements of claim filed as exhibits do not show the amount of money paid. The money was never actually paid back to the plaintiffs. 3) The plaintiff has not made out on a balance of probabilities that the loan of $5k, $1000, was a loan as there was no loan documentation prepared. There was no basis to withhold the $960 from the defendant on his last cheque. 4) The Court was not satisfied on a Balance of probabilities on the $5K, $5000 was a Loan as there's no loan Documentation prepared and signed. There's no basis for withholding the $9,000 from the defendants on their last cheques. 5) The $1 million was never given to Lilia.

4_2004skqb280.txt,"This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a). The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","FIAT: This is an application pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act (ISSA) for a declaration of paternity and child support. At the request of this Court, Ms. B appeared by telephone to give evidence with regard to her claims for undue hardship, s. expenses and retroactive child support based on undue hardship. HELD: 1) The Court must consider what is reasonable under the circumstances. The parties never lived together but had an intimate relationship. The Court will not impute income to him on the basis he is intentionally under-employed or unemployed. The facts do not support the imputation of income. The applicant must lead cogent evidence to establish why the table amount would cause undue hardship for her. 2) The father has three other children, aged 15 and 13 years of age, from two different mothers. The father works and lives alone with his children. His current income is below the amount normally required for Table support. He has four other children from another relationship. His standard of living is below that of the other children. The court cannot excute his child support obligations in furtherance of unrealistic or unproductive career aspirations. The child support application involves two steps: 1. The mother must seek employment in case the father is healthy and there is no reason why he cannot work; 2) If the father has genetic heart problems that affect his ability to do physical labour, the Court must determine whether he has a genetic heart condition that affects his ability do physical labor; 3) The child must begin his education in unremunerative employment. The parents cannot be excused from his childsupport obligations by self-induced reduction of income; 4) The court must decide whether he obtained employment and/or a contract position with the provincial government and, if so, his remuneration from that position. The onus is on the mother to establish that any continued unemployment is unintentional or, if intentional, that it is reasonable in the circumstances and does not warrant the imputed income."
b_2010skqb311.txt,"The accused was charged with having aftermarket tint on the side windows of his vehicle. He appealed on other grounds. The summary conviction appeal judge raised the issue of the sufficiency of the charge on its own motion. The face of the ticket purported to charge the accused with an offence under s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations. HELD: The charge was declared a nullity because it was drafted so poorly that it did not give fair notice to the accused of the charge or the penalty to be imposed if breach was established. Section 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations purports to make displaying aftermarket tint an offence, but the section is a charging offence and does not prescribe a penalty. The correct way to charge an accused with this offence is under s. 113 of The Traffic Safety Act which makes it an offence to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations. The count could not be amended to cure the defect because the charge was a nullity and void ab initio. The conviction was quashed.","The appellant appealed his conviction and sentence for 'unlawfully have sunscreen in front side windows' contrary to's.66(3) The Vehicle Equipment Regulations (VERT) Regulations (Reg. 10) and a fine of $350 for operating a vehicle with after-market tinted side windows. The police had tendered evidence of previous convictions for the same type of offence with the same vehicle and asked the court to impose a fine. The traffic justice found the appellant guilty as charged. The appellant did not exercise the voluntary payment option and instead sent an agent to appear on the March 10, 2008, return date at which time a 'not guilty' plea was entered and the matter was set down for trial. The Crown was given an opportunity to file written argument on the sufficiency issue. Standard of Review: The count cannot be amended so as to breathe life into something that is nullity.

b_2012skqb350.txt,"The applicant wife sought an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. The consent judgment provided that the husband should make an equalization payment of $105,000 to be composed of cash and/or a rollover of retirement funds. The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax. Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000. The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value. The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application. The evidence introduced at the hearing of the wife's position in pre-trial calculations clearly indicated that she expected the discount for tax on RRSPs. Therefore, the Court ordered that the judgment be satisfied by way of rollover of RRSPs in the amount of $111,600.","FIAT: The issue is the interpretation of a consent judgment based on negotiated family property settlement. Present counsel for the husband is new to the file, and was not the lawyer involved in the settlement. The wife seeks an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgement or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. HELD: 1) The respondent may satisfy the judgment by way of rollover to satisfy the equalizer payment. Negotiations are not relevant. The respondent has not proven that the agreement was binding. The court must examine the context in which the order was issued, evaluate the order in accordance with the circumstances, and question whether the acts or omissions could reasonably have been contemplated to fall under the terms of the order. 2) The court is required to look at the facts and to follow the applicable principles. 3) The parties were urged to try and resolve the matter themselves. They were unable to do so. 4) The wife was awarded judgment for $105,000. The parties are required to pay $25,000 in equalization and $55,000 by rollover. The husband is to pay half of the wife's RRSPs rolled over. The balance of the family property is divided. The petitioner is to be responsible for her Mastercard debt and the balance of her RRSP contributions are divided. 5) The consent judgment is to to be interpreted in the same manner as an agreement. Negotiation is not relevant as the parties were represented by experienced legal counsel. The Court must be able to enforce the judgment."

Application dismissed; the evidence would not be so complex and scientific that the plaintiff's substantive right to a jury trial should be denied. Although the medical charts exceeded 1500 pages, the more relevant hospital records were less than 100 pages; the essence of the liability issue would be limited in time, in the most relevant anatomical area and in the number of medical personnel involved in the relevant interventions; the factual material did not appear to be in dispute; and the issues were no more complex than most causation issues presented in medical malpractice cases.","The plaintiff was injured in a single motor vehicle accident. He was treated at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital by a doctor with an extensive medical background. During the course of the action, the plaintiff suffered a dislocation and a disk herniation. He died shortly after the plaintiff's medical intervention. The plaintiff brought an application to strike the defendant's jury notice as a matter of urgency. Application granted; jury notice to set aside jury notice dismissed; the applicant's application to have the jury notice be dismissed as a result of the plaintiff doctor's expert's opinion that many of the medical reports relating to the plaintiff were of such complexity that they could not be fully assessed by a properly informed jury. The court reviewed the various expert's opinions and evaluations submitted at the hearing and found that the jury would be capable of assessing the expert's expert evidence in a variety of ways. The medical evidence was not unusual nor unexpected in such cases and was helpful to the trier of fact in considering variations from the amounts claimed. The applicant's cross-claim against the plaintiff and the plaintiff was not unexpected. An expert report from an economist will be presented at trial in support of the defendant; the court was satisfied that the evidence would not be so complex and scientific that the applicant could not bestow a defence on the plaintiff."
e_1992canlii2542.txt,"This was an appeal of a decision declaring that the respondent was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant. Dismissing the appeal, that the insurer of a subcontractor on a construction project was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss by the insurer of the principle contractor where the risk was allocated by the contract documents to the principle contractor and not the subcontractor.","An appeal from a decision declaring that the respondent Guardian was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant Hartford. The respondent had entered a contract with Fraser-Brace for the construction of a hospital and required the insurer to obtain fire insurance. Without acknowledging liability, the respondent had been required to contribute under the terms of the policy issued to the appellant. The appellant had sought to recover its money with interest from Hartford on the basis that it was not responsible for the policy. The trial judge found the building was never at the insured's risk; that the policy was never issued to Guardian and there was no contractual relationship between Guardian and the Province, nor between Guardian's and Hartford, which could give rise to any obligation on Guardian's part to contribute towards the fire loss suffered by the Province and insured by Hartford. We reject the argument that there should not be an implied obligation to contribute by the respondent to the payment of the fire damage. The evidence as to the unreported amount paid by the applicant was not supported by the evidence."
1999canlii12687.txt,"The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act. The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police. A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road. The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance. The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC. He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine. The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches. HELD: The evidence is excluded. The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance. The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime. When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question. The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement. The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation. The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get. The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van. The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law. The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van. The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event. The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.","The accused was charged with operating a vehicle while under the influence of drugs and cultivation contrary to s. 4(1) the Narcotic Control Act and with unlawfully cultivating marijuana plants contrary to ss. 6(1), 7(8) and 9(9).

HELD: The accused's answer was two cases of wine. The Crown stipulated it was not arguing that the accused had consented to the search. Counsel raised the following issues arising from the Charter of Rights and Freedoms: 1) an arbitrary detention contrary to the Charter; 2) the residual right to silence pursuant to s7; 3) the search unreasonable contrary to Charter rights. The Court examined two questions. Was the accused detained prior to the question 'what is in the van?' when he asked if he could offer assistance; and was the initial search of the back end of the vehicle commenced? Counsel argued the search was unreasonable as it was conducted without the requisite foundation of reasonable and probable grounds. It was said the search itself began when the RCMP officer asked the accused for his name, address and where he had been. The police officer noted that one of the pockets of the accused's jeans appeared to be bulging and asked if it was intended for sale or had been purchased or obtained in violation of this Act. The court was satisfied that the question was not relevant as it had nothing to do with determining whether the accused required any assistance. The question was irrelevant as it did not determine whether the arrestee required any help."

The defendant has applied for an order setting aside the judgment and striking out the plaintiff's claim. A car-pedestrian accident occurred causing personal injury to the plaintiff. The defendant was convicted of dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. The plaintiff sued for battery and assault. The defendant was noted for default on this claim and the damages were assessed at $37,717.35, $10,000 of which were punitive. The plaintiff submits that s.102 of the Act should not deprive a citizen of the right to sue a defendant for injuries caused by assault, battery, fraud, or similar torts. HELD: The plaintiff has no cause for action by virtue of her injuries having been caused by an automobile. The plaintiff was precluded by s.102 of the Act from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. Although s.102 of the Act prohibits certain types of law suits, the act provides victims with compensation for injury.

HELD: There must be a declaration that the plaintiff was precluded, by s.102 of the Act, from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. 1)The wording in s. 102(a) of the act is indistinguishable from the wording in S. 143(1) of The Vehicles Act, 1983.

b_2013skpc213.txt,HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of both charges. The Court believed the testimony of the complainant.,The accused was charged with two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) and for sexual purposes touching a person under the age of 16 directly with part of his body contrary to ss. 151 of the Criminal Code. The accused was acquitted of both charges. The Court found that the accused had not believed the complainant's testimony and that she did not wish to be seen by the public. The complainant had not consumed alcohol until the evening following a dispute over access to the two-year-old child. HELD: The accused were convicted of both counts. The court concluded that the Crown proved the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt and that his evidence was not unreliable. The evidence of K.S. as to what transpired in her bedroom during the early hours of March 1 was also considered. The credibility of the witnesses was the most significant issue and therefore an application of the instructions in R. v. W.D.[1] must be undertaken. The case was similar to that of R. vs. W.: The accused claimed in Court that he recalled the events of the entire day and who insisted that he did not commit the offences. He was clearly wrong when he told the Court that his recollection of what happened was detailed and his evidence did not show that he was heavily under-weight of alcohol.
3_2001skqb332.txt,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act. Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.","The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act. The provisions of the Act provide for the use of a 'Director Tax Services Office' when the duties of the Director are performed by the Department. The Director Tax Services did not file the appropriate returns for the return for the period January 1, 1999 to March 31, 1999 and for the same period as the duty for which the Certificate of Registration was issued. The Certificate was signed by an employee of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency who had been authorized to prepare and issue documents for the business and had been permitted by the Director to use the facsimile signature stamp. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no error by the trial judge in finding that the Certificate was not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. The true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimilile signature. 2)The Certificate was properly issued. 3)The Court could find no error in the trial court's finding that it could not find no errors by the appellate court in R. v. Peters (1981), 12 Sask. R. 188 (Q.B.). 4)The Interpretation Act does not override an explicit statutory or regulatory delegation of authority. It merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the act. The fact that the true copy in the affidavit is of no moment is ofno moment."
b_1997canlii10986.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs applied for an order striking out the statement of defence and counterclaim and separate statement of Helen Rilkoff as not disclosing a reasonable defence or cause of action. The plaintiffs claimed the doctrine of res judicata applied to the claim for damages by virtue of two Small Claims court judgments in 1989 and 1992. The defendants asserted their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was different than those previously dealt with. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The fact that the plaintiffs filed a 55 page brief in support of their submissions and the defendants filed a 14 page brief in response evidenced that the issues were not easily resolved and certainly not on a summary basis.  2)An application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justifiable dispute is revealed. If no facts are in dispute, the parties may resort to Rule 188. Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve the questions of law.","FIAT The plaintiffs applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173 striking out the defendants statement of defence and counterclaim and the separate statement of defense of Helen Rilkoff. The plaintiffs claim they have not paid assessments since 1994 and that the cause thereof was a different cause than those dealt with in the 1989 and 1992 judgments. The defendants counterclaims that if the resolutions authorizing the assessments do not also contain resolutions authorizing them to recover interest and solicitor/client costs, the plaintiffs are not entitled to do so. The defence of Helen's right to sue for unpaid assessments and solicitor's costs was also raised in the defendants' application for an orders striking their equity of redemption. HELD: Application dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause.  1)The Court has a pre-trial custody hearing and therefore a pre -trial custody proceeding. 2)The pre-condominium property act pre-conditionitions for hearing applications pursuant to Rule 188 are quite different to those relating to Rule 173 in that an application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justiciable dispute is revealed. Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to QBA Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve what appeared to be rather serious questions of law. 3)The application of the plaintiffs was bedismissed with costs in any case of thecause."
c_2007skqb224.txt,"FIAT: The accused applicant brings an application for a change in venue in this matter pursuant to s. 599(1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: 1). The application for a change of venue is denied. 2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue. There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports. However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application. In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue. However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found. Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre. It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered.",FIAT: The applicant brought an application for a change of venue in this matter pursuant to s.599(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused seeks an order granting a trial in the City of Prince Albert or such other judicial centre as the Court deems appropriate. The Crown counsel opposed the application. HELD: 1)The Court reviewed the evidence and found that the accused had not met the onus of proof necessary to succeed on this application. 2)A reasonably serene environment was possible in Saskatoon despite the fact that media reports and memorials were often posted on social media. 3)The majority of media reports were over year old. There was no evidence that the media reports had created a frightened or enraged community such as was the case in Charest. The Court was satisfied that simply because the offence in question involved a knife would not lead a jury to be prejudiced against an accused in this particular case.
3_1994canlii3972.txt,"After an argument with his girlfriend, the appellant drove his car at high speed with the lights off, running two stop signs. At the second intersection he collided with another vehicle, causing serious injury to three people. He pleaded guilty to three counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm; the Crown proposed an intermittent sentence, but the judge sentenced him to nine months incarceration concurrent on each count plus two years probation with conditions. The appellant appealed on the grounds the judge failed to consider the Crown's recommendation, failed to sufficiently state his reasons, and the sentence was excessive. Dismissing the appeal, that the sentencing power of a judge is not limited by Crown submissions, that the failure to state every reason does not constitute and error, and that in view of the appellant's record and other factors, the sentence was not excessive to the point of constituting a reversible error.","The 19 year old male appellant pled guilty to three charges of dangerous driving causing bodily harm following an argument with his girlfriend. He was sentenced to nine months incarceration plus two years probation on each charge to be served concurrently. He suffered a broken arm and an undisplaced pelvic fracture and fractured ribs, and two fractures to his cervical spine. He also had five previous motor vehicle accidents and three infractions involving the use of motor vehicle. The three convictions indicate a lack of respect for the law, which was demonstrated in the actions at issue. The appeal was dismissed. The sentence imposed was not based on the principles of sentencing as it did not accord with the probation conditions set out in the probation report."
6_2006nsca89.txt,"Six years after the action was commenced, the plaintiff applied to add the defendant's Section D insurer in order to add a cause of action against an unidentified driver. The limitation period for suing under Section D had expired and no notice of the application had been given to the insurer. The chambers judge held that he had no discretion to grant the amendment and dismissed the application. The plaintiff appealed. Appeal allowed; the plaintiff is entitled to renew the application for the amendment in Supreme Court chambers on notice to the proposed, as well as the existing, defendant within sixty days of today's date; if not filed within that time, the application to add the insurer will be deemed to have been abandoned. The court had a discretion to grant the amendment even though the case did not fall within any of the specific situations set out in Rule 15.02 as the broad power to amend conferred by Rule 15 is not limited to the specific instances set out the Rule. Although there was no firm rule that notice to a proposed defendant was necessary in all such applications, generally the applicant should give notice to the proposed defendant (as well as the existing parties) where it is apparent from the circumstances that the proposed defendant likely has a reasonable basis to oppose being joined, such as being prejudiced in its defence by the plaintiff's long delay in asserting his claim.","The appellant sues the Halifax Regional Municipality for negligence. Years later, he decided he should amend his action to add a new claim against a new defendant. By then, the new claim was barred by a limitation period. He applied in Supreme Court chambers for permission to make the amendment. The chambers judge held that he did not have authority under Rules 15.01 and 15.02 to grant leave to the appellant to amend his statement of claim to add Lombard as a party and to assert the Section cause of action against it. The appellant applied to renew the application. The issue was whether the judge should have granted the amendment because this case did not fall into any of the specific powers to amend in the Civil Procedure Rules. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the application to set aside was allowed. The decision on whether the amendment should be granted was not appealed. The matter was left to the Supreme Court to decide. 1)Limidity of the Rules in relation to limitation periods has limited the Court's discretion to grant the amendment; the Court must consider all relevant matters. 2)The limitation period has intervened and an important consideration relates to whether the appellant's delay has prejudiced the defendant's defence. Lombard should receive notice. 3)The appeal was granted in part. The Court could not find a reason to deny the application but could not say that the chambers judge had not exercised his discretion. 4)Limitations may be used to permit an amendment to be granted in the absence of notice to a party. 5)The Court could only grant leave if it was apparent that the proposed new defendant had a reasonable basis to oppose being joined. 6)The issue was not whether the expiry of the limitation period trumps the power to amend, but whether it is just to grant it."
8_1996canlii4963.txt,The appellant was acquitted of communicating with another person for the purpose of prostitution. A new trial was ordered on the basis that the Provincial Court judge included a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with the respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. The Queen's Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test that set out in R. v. Schmidt. HELD: The proper disposition is to set aside the judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence. 1)On reading the entire oral judgment the court concluded that the judge was saying in effect that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place. 2)The trial judge was incorrect in finding that under s.213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid.,"The appellant was acquitted after trial in the Provincial Court of communicating with another person for the purpose of engaging in prostitution contrary to s. 213(1)(c) of the Code. However, on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench a new trial was ordered, and in that judgment, a new verdict was ordered. HELD: The Court of Appeal held that a new Trial was ordered and that it was from that judgment that this appeal arose. The Queen's bench judge interpreted her oral reasons to include a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. The appellant was not adding the need for specific conversation. The fact that the conversation did not reach the point where the matter of payment was discussed would not preclude the jury from reasonably concluding that an act of prostitution involving the payment of payments for sexual favours was contemplated. The Court also held that if the Provincial court judge had found under s.(213) the actuus reuf must include a specific phrase specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid for them, she was incorrect."
4_2011skpc13.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care or control. The Court dismissed the charge of care or control over .08 after a non-suit application. During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying. During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech. In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.  The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence. HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document. The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out. While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence. This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1).","The accused, charged with impaired driving, applied to the Court for a stay of the impaired driving charge and an order for a mistrial on that count, a direction that the Crown prosecutor be allowed to further cross-examine Crown witnesses and an ordered excluding evidence. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence under s. 7 of the Charter as a result of a lack of full disclosure. HELD: The Court found that the officer did not make any notation in his notes or in his General Occurrence Report about his observations of the accused and that such a question would inevitably drawn the re-direct examination which occurred in this case. The Court also found that although the Crown lawyer referred to the original Checksheet during the Crown's case, he did not take sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what he had in his file and what had been disclosed to the defence. The Crown did not provide full disclosure to the accused. The application under s24(1) was dismissed. As the Crown had completed its case, the Crown completed its own case and the accused was able to call evidence at this trial. As a result, the Court found no need to consider s. 24(2) application. The defence had not obtained full disclosure from the Crown, retained the Checksheet, retained its original owner and introduced the Checksheets into evidence without taking sufficient time, care and attention to ensure they were what he (and the accused) had in their file and were properly disclosed. The Certificate of Disclosure was never issued to the officer."
9_2013skca110.txt,"HELD: The Court addressed the issue of jurisdiction by holding that it would follow its usual practice to refuse to hear an entirely new matter argued for the first time on appeal. Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act. The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested. The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act. However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances.","The applicant appealed the chambers judge's decision dismissing his application under Queen's Bench Rule 173(e) and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to strike out or stay the application of the Director of Community Operations for a community safety order under The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act because the Director's application constituted a multiplicity of proceedings and was therefore an abuse of process. Appeal dismissed; the Director’s grounds of appeal were that there was no abuse of processes and that the Chambers judge had not met the three tests set out in s. 25(1)(a) and s. 2(b) of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 and that there were no errors made by the Chambers Judge in determining that there had not been abuse ofprocess."

The order was made to diminish the disparity between the income and lifestyles of the parties. The application for interim distribution of property was dismissed. The court found that this was not a situation where the net assets exceeded the amount of the distribution claimed. As the respondent had no liquid assets, the distribution of family property might eventually involve a spousal rollover from the pension funds to the petitioner.","FIAT: The wife applies for interim spousal support and an order providing her with an interim distribution of property in the amount of $25,000. HELD: 1) The parties were in a spousa relationship for almost 10 years. They had no children together although the husband had a children from a prior relationship for whom he paid support. During this period the wife suffered from health problems which resulted in her becoming disabled and unable to continue her employment. During the relationship the wife secured full-time employment with CN but, since she suffered from long-term health problems, she had resided with extended family members, most of whom were also seeking housing. Since the marriage ended in 2015 the wife, who had one minor child, had resided in extended family member with the result that she had no costs for housing. She now sought an order in the sum of $2,000 per month to equalize the gross incomes of the parties and to allow her to absorb the additional cost of her move into a new home. She also sought spousousal assistance from an interim spouse in the form of an order for $25k.  2) The husband did not take issue with the wife's entitlement to interim support but stated that she failed to demonstrate need for support. She indicated that the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines should not apply. The Spousals Advisory Guidelines do not apply in this situation. 3) The Spouse Affidavit filed under s. 26(2) of The Family Property Act does not prescribe separate considerations, factors and objectives for interim Spousa support as opposed to final determination of spousals. The statute does not suggest separate considerations or objectives for spousalin support as well as a final determination. The primary purpose of interim spielal support is to allocate family income in a fair and equitable manner during this transition period. The parties concede that this issue cannot be resolved on an interim motion. The wife's application for an interim payment of the $25K requested by the wife is dismissed."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)There was clearly no basis for adding the value of the grain on hand to the income of the respondent. There was no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondent and the grain was to be viewed as part of his gross income in the year in which it was sold. 2)There was no reversible error by the chamber judge in accepting the respondent's agreement to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income. What if any portion should be added must be based on the facts of each case.,"The appellant sought to have the chamber judge's support payments ordered by the chamber's judge increased on the basis the respondent was incorrectly estimated and should have been found to be much greater. The respondent agreed to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income and this was accepted by the trial judge who recognized that commercial realities require the replacement of farm equipment. What, if any, portion of the capital cost allowances should be added to establish available income must be based on the facts of each case and we see no reversible error in the acceptance of this figure by the chambers judge in this instance. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the usual costs on double Column V. The appellant did not have to subtract the value of unsold grain on hand and 100 percent of the farm equipment to establish his income. The trial judge accepted the respondent's income by adding the valueof unsold grains on hand. There was no reversible errors in the adjustment of the figure by him in this case."

The Attorney General opposed severance on the ground the Government of Canada would be prejudiced in its claim for apportionment of the amount of any judgment as between the Government of Canada and the Oblates. HELD: It was in the best interests of justice that the order of severance be granted so the issue may proceed to an early trial. The issues of cross-claim and third party proceedings will take a very lengthy period of time.

9_1992canlii2588.txt,", The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault. Allowing the appeal, that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity. The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward. The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.","This was an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. Appeal allowed; conviction entered on the charge of assault with intent. The trial judge failed to properly direct himself as to the type of evidence necessary to conclude, as a result of the appellant's degree of intoxication, that there was reasonable doubt that the respondent had the minimal intent required for the offence of common assault."

Dismissing the appeals, that the trial judge made no errors in his considerations. The sentences were consistent with the range the Appeal Court had approved in numerous judgments.","The appellant pled guilty to two offences. He was the parent of one child when the robbery occurred. He had prior record of several convictions, including dispositions entered by the Youth Court. He pled guilty. At his trial the Crown and the defence put forward the appellant's defence of a sentence of four years for the armed robbery and 1 year for the weapons offence to be served consecutively.

8_2010skca149.txt,"The father appealed from the decision of the Chamber's judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment. The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below. The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant. For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances. No error was made on this issue. The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz. The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting. She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests. There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them. The Chamber's judge was entitled to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the children. There is no material error or misapprehension of the evidence.","The father appealed the decision of the Chambers judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment dated March 30, 2005 governing custody and access to the parties' children. The application before the Chambers court included child maintenance issues but the father did not appeal that part of the decision. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Chambers judge was entitled to consider only the impact of the change in circumstances when making her determination, by failing to apply the principle of maximum contact, by applying a presumption of the status quo, by virtue of her previous findings of fact, and by finding that evidence as to the wishes of the children was irrelevant. 2) The evidentiary threshold necessary to make a decision based on all the uncontroverted evidence was reached.  3) The chambers judge did not properly consider the principleof maximum contact. The evidence regarding the children's wishes was limited and inconclusive. In the context of conflicting evidence regarding their wishes, it is open to the Chambers Judge to decline to make finding on the issue and to proceed to base the decision on other factors. This argument cannot succeed. 4) The Court was of the view there was an insufficient factual basis for the making of the custody order in issue."

(formerly Peat Marwick Thorne Inc.) is the trustee of her bankrupt estate. The applicant received an absolute discharge on March 8, 1996. The trustee has never applied for a discharge. The trustee did not oppose the applicant's discharge and in its report dated February 8, 1996 stated that the there were no facts, matters or circumstances that would justify the Court in refusing an unconditional order of discharge. Now, more than 13 years later, there remains an unresolved issue concerning non-exempt equity in the applicant's homestead. The applicant applies for relief under s. 37 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for an order reversing the trustee's decisions and restoring the property interest to her. The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that only the value of non-exempt homestead equity existing at the time of the bankrupt's application for discharge can be attached by the trustee. HELD: The Court made the order applied for by the applicant including an order for costs.","A bankruptcy petition was filed in 1995 and received an absolute discharge in 1996. The trustee had never applied for discharge. The applicant, who was registered as owner of residential property in the City of Saskatoon having an exemption, alleged that the trustee had transferred an 82% interest in the real property to her name and that she had not committed any offence in connection with the bankruptcy. HELD: The order for costs was granted. 1)The respondent carefully considered the potential sale price and the potential sales price of the respondent's property and concluded that the value of the applicant's homestead at the time of her bankruptcy was not warranted to make an absolute order for discharge available to the applicant. 2)The trustee did not oppose the applicant’s discharge and in its report, prepared pursuant to s.170 of the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 as am. by the Bankola administration, Haskins Sells Ltd. (1988), 1987 CanLII 4662, the Court of Appeal set out minimum requirements for a trustee to meet when dealing with non-exempt equity in bankrupt’’ homestead. These requirements were set out in Re Zemlak and Deloitte. 3)The applicant was granted an order for the costs. 4)The order for monies was made in the amount of $200,000 to the trustee. The respondent would receive an exemption from the trustee for $32,000 for the $50,000 nonexempt equity and the $32000 for exempt equity. 5)The respondents would be entitled to exemptions from the Bankowing Act if the applicant elected to re-open her homestead and were permitted to buy out the trustee’ s.172 exemption and the exempt equity if she elected to do so. 6)The caveat should be vacated if it were not for the trustee that any increase in the equity should accrue to the benefit of the creditors. 7)The court found that the respondent had no evidence that she would realize upon the value her non- exempt equity in the homestead if the application for discharge were granted. 8)The Order for Costs was granted in the context of the present application for a discharge."

HELD: 1) A party to litigation cannot decline to answer questions on an examination for discovery that are intended to elicit the facts on which that party has based its pleading. A party is required to divulge the facts that it has now or admit that it has none if such is the case. The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that he can be further examined on the responses. If the position of the defendant as set forth in those responses changes as a result of after acquired information, the defendant shall so inform the plaintiff by way of supplemental responses within 90 days following the completion of the defendant's examinations for discovery of the third parties. If it is necessary for the plaintiff to further examine for discovery on the defendant's responses or supplemental responses, the defendant's proper officer shall attend such examination for discovery. 2) The material filed satisfies the Court that PSAC documents relating to the PST issue are at least broadly relevant to the issues and that BJ Services likely has the power to obtain and produce them. The fact that BJ Services may intend to claim a litigation privilege over the documents, or that PSAC may not produce them, does not relieve BJ Services of the obligation to disclose their existence. BJ Services shall provide further and better disclosure of documents by providing a detailed list of documents referred to in the second part of the second schedule of its statement as to documents. If a claim for privilege is asserted over such documents, BJ Services shall identify the basis of such claim, the date of the documents, the name of the sender and the names of the recipients.",FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery in this action. The plaintiff seeks judgment for the amount paid. The purpose of the examinations is to determine whether the third parties are liable or entitled to payment of PST on the sale of tangible personal property pursuant to the governing legislation. The parties agree that the examinations are for discovery purposes and that they will provide the plaintiff with responses to any questions asked. The defendant denies any wrongdoing and the third party vendors are not obligated to provide full and complete responses to undertakes. HELD: The application for orders is granted. The court will determine the validity of any objections. The broad relevance test applies to both disclosure of documents and questions put and responses to undertaking. The examination for discovery is a complex and time consuming process and the discovery process can take many years. The documents listed in the undertakings are subject to change. The respondent is not obligated by law to provide the documents to the plaintiff. The Certificate of Disclosure is not required. The certificate of disclosure is not mandatory. The information contained in the documents is sufficient to enable the plaintiff to access the full and accurate records of the undertakes and services provided. The certification is not a condition to participate in the examinations. The Court will not force the respondent to provide complete responses. The Common Law Amendment is not applicable to any of the above.
b_2001skqb124.txt,"The medical doctor alleged the other medical doctors owed a fiduciary duty to act in good faith with respect to their agreement to perform on-call services for the District Health Board. Under the voluntary arrangement doctors who chose not to enter the arrangement remained on-call to look after their own patients and to respond to emergencies. It worked well until Hanna established another clinic and began dividing his time between Regina and the Moosomin clinic. HELD: The actions against the doctors and health district were dismissed with taxed costs.  1)Hanna's exclusion from the roster was authored by his own conduct. When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him. Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital. He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence. He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days. Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition. His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors. The on-call arrangement was voluntary. There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood. There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.  4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District. Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors. There was no basis in law or fact supporting the existence of a fiduciary relationship between Hanna and the Health District.","A medical doctor brought an action against three doctors alleging that each of them owed a duty of trust and a fiduciary duty to act towards him in good faith in connection with an arrangement entered into by all the doctors to perform the on-call services required of them by the defendant, the Pipestone District Health Board. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The common characteristics defining a fiduary relationship were discussed by Cameron J.A. in Baskerville v. Thurgood and the Moosomin Union Hospital. The common characteristics of a fiducary relationship was discussed by the doctors. 2)The hospital was neither the originator of the on call arrangement introduced by the physicians nor party to it. The administrator of the hospital and chief executive officer for Pipestone district tolerated the plan and, to that extent only co-operated with the doctors in its implementation because when it operated well it delivered to the hospital the services it required. 3)The relationship between hospital and its doctors, described by Cameron as a'men's agreement' had none of the characteristics normally attending a duty or a fidueary duty. The dominant and overriding obligation of each doctor was to provide continuous care to his patients 24 hours day, 7 days week, and to respond to emergencies. 4)The fact that the hospital was not the originators of the 'on-call' arrangement but rather a voluntary one, which was not subject to the Board's regulation, did not harm the hospital or its reputation, nor did it compromise its reputation or hinder its ability to deliver the services its patients require. 5)The court dismissed the action against the doctor with costs."
7_2001canlii346.txt,"The Crown withdrew one count at the opening of the trial and the accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration in excess of .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician. HELD: The accused was found guilty. There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying. The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient. His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples. The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient. 3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required. 4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay. The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.","The accused was charged with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called as witnesses the boyfriend of the accused's sister-in-law and the doctor of the police officer who at the time was an inmate. The accused testified at trial that he had had the doctor complete the wrong form for the wrong reason and that he was concerned about his health. The officer testified that he asked the doctor for permission to take the blood and he signed the wrong certificate. The doctor testified that when he was first told the accused was in the hospital he was advised that he would be kept in the Hospital. The police officer testified at his trial that the officer asked him if he could talk to the accused about impaired driving and the accused testified that his recollection of the events was not clear. HELD: The Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all of the matters that could have been proved by the certificate, P-5, if it could have relied upon. 1)The facts were in the mind of the officer at the moment he decided to make the demand did amount to reasonable and probable grounds for his doing so. The facts were facts. The Court found that the accused had acted in the best interests of his family and friends in taking care of their own affairs and the fact that the medical doctor had advised the accused that he should not be afraid to take his blood sample for law enforcement purposes did not affect his evidence. The court found that in receiving permission from the doctor, the officer was of the view that the doctor was granting such permission because the doctor held the opinion that the taking of the blood samples for law-enforcement reasons would not endanger the life or health of the... accused. The evidence was in relation to a visit by the officer to the hospital and not at his home. The Certificate was signed by the doctor. The certificate was not signed at the doctor's home. 2)The Court found beyond a doubt that the Crown's evidence was not supported by the Certificate, P5, which could have supported the conclusion that the Court had not relied upon the Certificate as a whole. The Certificates were not signed by either the doctor or the officer. The certificates were signed by both the doctor and the officer respecting the doctor respecting the medical practitioner's opinion that they would not affect the accused. 3)The Certificate was not a"
d_2011skpc110.txt,"The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident. The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After being detained at the police station, he attempted unsuccessfully to reach three different lawyers. Eventually, he spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel, who advised him that the officer had given him only one choice, that of Legal Aid. The accused sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: The Court held the Charter breaches were moderately serious. The officer's reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body was not raised as part of the reasonable and probable grounds for making the demand. The Certificate ofalyses was admitted into evidence. The Court found the accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights were not infringed. The certificate of analysis was admitted as a finding that the delay was of 11 minutes. The court found that the Certificate was not excluded under s. 24(2) of The Code. The issue is whether the Certificate is incorporated into the Certificate as an analysis is whether it should be. The Act is intended to ensure that the certificate is not used for arbitrary detention. The Charter is not breached. The facts are not contradictory. The trial judge found that once the accused was detained and the ASD was not made forthwith, the delay is irrelevant. The delay of 11 minute is largely due to the unavailability of the ASD. The police did not ask the accused if he had had a last drink. The breath sample was not obtained until after the demand was made. The failure of the officer to obtain an ASD sample was considered by the Court. The defence argued that the lack of an ASD test, which was not available at the time of detention, would prejudice the accused’s s. 8, 9 and 10(B) Charter right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure was breached. In R. v. Ritchie, [2004 SKQB 150] the Court found that while there was an element of delay, the overall delay was not that long and the Certificate’ s. 9 and s. 11 of the Charter were irrelevant."

The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle. Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal entered. The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle. But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.","The appellant appealed his conviction for driving a motor vehicle while suspended, contending the adjudicator's findings were so flawed that he did not properly interpret the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act, and did not offer a reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant was the driver. Allowing the appeal, that the conviction was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence, and that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the appellant's son was in the vehicle. The adjudicator also failed to address the issue of whether the Crown's witness, the RCMP officer, was reasonably capable of being evidence to the contrary so as to raise reasonable doubt. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction of the appellant on the grounds the adjudicating judge did not address the issues of credibility; the Crown had established a prima facie case, having proved all the elements of the offence necessary for conviction, and on the basis of the acceptable evidence heard, the Court was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the accused in this matter."

The chambers judge granted the application finding that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information and that to allow the writ to stand would constitute an abuse of process. The issue on appeal is whether the chambers judge erred in inquiring into the accuracy of the facts sworn to in the proposed appellant's affidavit, in light of the provision in Rule 407(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules that provides that the validity of the writ shall not be questioned in any interlocutory proceeding where the affidavit substantially complies with the requirements of the Rule.

The proposed appellors sought and obtained a writ of replevin in relation to the dogs pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 406-10. The respondent provided an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $12,000 as security in accordance with Rule 408. The sheriff seized two of the disputed dogs then in her possession.

HELD: Leave to appeal was granted. While the wording of the Rules may be vexing to some, they are not in the nature of frivolous appeal. While they are very narrow and not in their vitiements, they raise a very important issue of the Court's day. While it is not plain that the chambers judge in chambers is required to determine the merits of the application in light of the wording in s. 407(2) of the Queen's B Rules, they do raise a fairly important issue in the Court.

The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer. The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer. 1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed. Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.  2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other. The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer.","HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of two counts of aggravated assault and an alcohol abstention breach.

Application to disallow the limitation defence dismissed; plaintiff's action dismissed. The plaintiff's evidence did not show any valid reason for such a lengthy delay and the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled. Not only was there a presumption that the evidence would now be less cogent than it would have been, but the defendants' storage warehouse was destroyed by fire 3 years ago resulting in the loss of many old records, including those relating to the motel.","The plaintiff, who had been employed by the defendant as office manager for a number of companies, assumed the operation of a motel by lease with an option to purchase.

The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate. The plaintiff alleged the issuance of the certificate caused mental anguish, emotional suffering, and loss of liberty and alleged conspiracy, abuse of process, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)Our civil procedure does not contemplate the trial of an issue on a person's competence to bring a lawsuit. A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act had the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding legal proceedings and would result in the appointment of a litigation guardian.

The defendants are of the view that on the basis of the evidence that led to the original certificate of mental incompetency being issued, and the evidence led at the reviewpanel, they have more than reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff lacks the mental competence to instruct counsel in this law suit and are not at risk of losing their right to conduct his own affairs on the same basis as the opinion of one person. 2)The Court was not aware of any law that suggested costs incurred in defending yourself in a civil action against person who is subsequently found to be incapable of managing his or her estate are not recoverable from the estate of such person. 3)The application was allowed in part. 4)Costs were not ordered to be paid. 5)The court was not obliged to take this step based on the evidence presented."

The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick. To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG). MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent. Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference. Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced. The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process. They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money. The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process. HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed. 1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.  'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act. The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications. They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses. The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act. That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction. The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act. The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed. They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. 2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case. There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions. That alone, without the assistance of s. 6 and the other amending provisions of the Saskatchewan Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that the action should be appropriately (but conditionally) stayed.","The plaintiff commenced his class action in June 2006 against the defendants, the original defendants and a third party. The plaintiff applied to the Court to stay the action pending review of various existing claims. The defendants and third parties applied to stay either permanently or on an interim basis, the plaintiff's claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act. The applicants argue that substantially similar proceedings claiming similar relief for similar claims have been commenced in other jurisdictions in Canada, now in the Federal Court of Canada. HELD: The Court acknowledges that the application to stay is an abuse of the Court's process and that the Court has the statutory and inherent jurisdiction to order the action stayed. However, this appeal does not require the Court of Appeal to engage in an exploration of the general approach which Saskatchewan courts should take in the face of typical overlapping multi-jurisdictional class actions. The Court of appeal in Englund, reversing the trial court decision, ordered a conditional stay of the action. The Saskatchewan action is a multi-judgment action commenced in different jurisdictions and is subject to the same set of criteria as the original Saskatchewan action: the right to be heard, the jurisdiction to determine where the action should be held, the time to apply for certification, the number of witnesses and the location of the representative plaintiffs and class members in the various actions, including the ability of representative plaintiffs to participate in the actions and to represent the interests of the class members; and the adequacy of the proposed relief in the settlement hearing."
d_2004nssf61.txt,"The wife sought a divorce, custody, child support, a division of matrimonial assets and an order directing that the husband's equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child reached 19 years of age. She proposed to sell the home and put the proceeds, together with a new mortgage, towards the purchase of a new home. Joint custody awarded for all four children, with the father to have primary care and control of the oldest and the mother to have primary care and control of the three younger children; the father is to pay child support for three children in the guideline amount and the mother is to pay child support for one child in the guideline amount; the husband's equity in the matrimonial home is frozen at the amount owing on the mortgage when the parties separated and his interest is postponed until the youngest child reaches the age of 21 years; if the wife wishes to obtain a new home in a new location, she will be required to pay out the husband's equity in the matrimonial home.","The petitioner sought a divorce and custody, child support, child care and joint custody. The respondent sought to have the parties' equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child was 19 years old. The mother sought to sell the home and buy a new house; the respondent opposed this application. The father argued that he would need to pay child support of $25,000 to be paid from his equity in his equity IN the matron home. The wife argued that the costs of preparing the children for school were high and that they would require a mortgage of more than $100,000. The child support application for a share of the equity in that home was refused as it was a rental property. The husband argued that if the mother could not find a mortgage that would allow him to pay the mortgage, he would have to buy a house. The daughter sought to buy another home. HELD: The court ordered the father's continued interest in the home to be postponed to the youngest son's 21 year of age. The court found that the father was entitled to some form of equity in this home, but the court refused to permit him to have it. The children's school expenses were to be divided, with the primary and secondary expenses to be determined by the parties. The Court found that since the parties had chosen to live in the house and not have it for the youngest children, the father would be severely restricted in his ability to pay for the children's education. The monies from the sale of the home would be used to pay off the mortgage and the children would have access to the matrionial home on any day of the week. The parties would have joint custody of the children and the monies would be divided equally. The primary and primary expenses were calculated by the father as they would be the basis upon which the monial payments would come off equalization payments upon termination of exclusive possession of the property."

On Appeal.","The Trustee sought an order prohibiting law firms from acting as counsel for the Trustee in the estate of a bankrupt. The bankrupt had been appointed as custodian of the estate under the terms of the debenture and claimed to be creditor of the bankrupt. This was a conflict of interest which required the removal of the counsel for both the Trustees and the Bank. The Trustee was to meet with the estate's inspectors to determine whether the applicants should continue to act for the Bank or seek independent legal advice on the matter. The lawyer for the bankrupt had acted for the trustee and had advised the Truste on the proper administration of the assets of the Bank when it was in bankruptcy. The trustee sought independent legal counsel. The inspector dismissed the application. The applicant sought to have the law firms withdraw from acting for the trustee. The solicitor for the bank advised the applicants that they should seek independent counsel on the issue. The trustee refused and the inspector brought a motion requesting the withdraw the counsel. HELD: The Trustees were ordered to provide the applicant with full particulars of the claim. The court must also consider its supervisory responsibility in relation to the bankrupt estate. The sufficiency of the claims filed by the bankrupt against the Bank was not precisely the same as that of the Trust's counsel for other creditors. The Court was of the view that since the bankrupt was not seeking independent legal legal advice from counsel for its creditor, it should not be obliged to provide it to its own counsel."

5_2003skqb115.txt,"Creditor and Debtor - Conversion - Punitive Damages FIAT. A motion for summary judgment under Queen's Bench Rule 485 governing simplified procedure. The plaintiff claimed the creditor wrongfully converted monies after a full and final settlement of his account for a lesser sum ($2,000 on a $15,600 account). He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'. The plaintiff assigned his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application to his outstanding account in May 2001. In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle. An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died. The defendant says it was subsequently induced to settle the debt for a lesser sum by the plaintiff's false representation that SGI was suing him for between $200,000 and $300,000; that he would be found liable and would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy, making the account uncollectible. SGI initiated proceedings against the plaintiff in May 2002 claiming $17,660. The defendant contended that, if there was an accord and satisfaction, it was avoided due to mistake of fact or misrepresentation. HELD: The application for summary judgment was dismissed.

The plaintiff claims his creditor wrongfully converted monies after full settlement of his account was agreed upon. In addition, the plaintiff seeks punitive damages for the defendant's 'high-handed and malicious behavior'. HELD: The application for summary judgment was dismissed. A summary trial was ordered. Costs in the cause were to be divided between the parties. 1)The plaintiff was not seeking summary judgment. The test set out in Caudle v. Louisville Sales Service Inc. (1999) does not assist the plaintiff. 2)The test of whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavit material filed can be resolved in the absence of cross-examination and it would not otherwise be unjust to do so. One way that contradictory evidence can be decided in the absent of cross examination is where for the purposes of the application the court accepts the defendant’s evidence wherever it conflicts with that of the plaintiff and still concludes the plaintiff is entitled to judgment.  3)The defendant was relying on misrepresentation as the ground for vitiating the settlement agreement rather than mutual mistake. The court noted that in order for the plaintiff to succeed, there must have been an operative misrepresentation regarding a matter of fact. In this case, the defendant asserted that the plaintiff was being sued for damages in the range of $250,000 to $300,000.

Each of the three Informations sworn by an RCMP officer alleged the accused and his 19 year old daughter committed incest contrary to s.155, and a 7 month old child was born as a result. The Informations deposed that the Crown had obtained a DNA sample of the person who claimed to be the natural mother of the 19 year old.HELD: 1)No case was found dealing was a similar application regarding a possible charge under s.155. The words of s.487.05 were analyzed to determine its proper meaning and interpretation. 'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable. Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed. Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a). 2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations. The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable. There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking. The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out. The paragraphing format was confusing. 3)A DNA warrant application would be premature. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood. It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained. It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now.","The Crown applied for DNA warrants to obtain blood samples from the male, female and child. Each alleges that the accused and their 19-year old daughter committed incest, contrary to s. 155 of the Code, and that child, now months old, has been born as result of the incestuous relationship. The Informations in Support depose that the Crown has obtained a DNA sample from the person who says she is the mother of the accused. Although it is not stated in the Informations if the DNA sample is not linked in any satisfactory fashion to the alleged father, it is of no probative value as it is a distinctive birthmark. Nor is it of no relation to the blood sample of the natural mother. There is nothing from the naturalmother positively stating that no other person could be the father of the 19- year old female. HELD: A DNA warrant application with respect to the baby would be premature, but may be renewed in due course if the Crown is advised. The proper inference to be drawn from the words of Gerein J. (who trained the corporal who trained him to be a DNA technician) is that a DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father of both the girl and the baby and how it will negative any suggestion that the father and mother are'strangers' genetically speaking. The Court was of the view that a blood sample obtained from an unknown source would be a sufficient and timely evidence to satisfy the court that the alleged incestuous relationships were firmly under control of the Crown."
e_2007skqb179.txt,"Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer. The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement. Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement. The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test. The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement. The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly.","This is an application for judicial review of a Board of Arbitration Award which held that the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a Collective Agreement in force between the parties. The facts of the case are reasonably straightforward. The applicant was a First Nations faculty member who was involved in the creation and operation of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations. He had received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Regina but believed he was being invited to present the results of research he had done for an Assembly of First Nations national political organization. The FOU had been involved in planning and organizing the symposium and, in some capacity, was involved with the organizing and presentation of the event. The respondent was disappointed at this turn of events and sought to have the decision reversed. He sent a letter to the President of the First Nation asking whether it might be possible to intervene and request the symphonic presentation to reconsider his presentation. The application was dismissed with costs. HELD: The application for review was dismissed. 1)The reasons as a whole support the decision. The reasons as whole support that finding. The decision meets the reasonableness test.  2)The FOU brought a grievance against the Board of Governors and sought its dismissal with costs on the basis that the decision of the Board was exceeded by its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance which did not involve parties to the collective agreement. However, the Board made a clear finding of fact that the alleged breach of the Collective Agreement occurred while the respondent was acting in his capacity as Chair of the University's Board of governors and not as an officer of the federation. That finding brought the issue within the purview of the Agreement. There is no disputing the fact he was invited to speak at the symphony. The formal grievance specifically refers to interference with the respondent's academic freedom. These actions by FNUC and its Board are an abuse of authority and are harassing and intimidating actions against this faculty member. In addition, FNUC has interfered with the academic freedom of the respondent in violation of the FNUC/URFA Academic Collective Bargaining Agreement (2002-2005).

e_2006skqb519.txt,"The Bank presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent corporation respecting assets leased by the respondent to Sweeprite. By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease. This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business.","The Bank of Montreal (the Bank) presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent Patchrite respecting assets leased by the Bank of Canada. The applications are brought pursuant to ss. 63 and 66 of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The Bank's motion heard and decided by filing an Agreed Statement of Facts with attached exhibits. The Bank has cooperated in having the motion heard. The issue is which of the two companies has priority to the equipment subject to the Lease. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the PPSA and it required registration. The Court found that the Bank was'regularly engaged in the business of leasing' within s. 63' and therefore it is not entitled to the exemption from the registration requirements of s. 3. The leases in question were therefore 'A lease for more than 1 year' in the meaningof the PSSA and they required registration; the lease in issue was therefore a lease for 'a term of... 1 year', it required Registration. The only authority which appears to come to contrary result is the case of Milltimber, the lessor in the Planwest, case. There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the company engaged in until May 2001 when it transferred to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The present and after-acquired personal property is subject to different legislation and regulations relating to the use of the land, buildings and equipment throughout. The Land, Building and Equipment Lease was therefore subject to a lease of more then 1 year within the PPPA and its exemption did not apply. The leased equipment has been sold and the amount of $100,000, the amount set aside for a trust to be paid out in accordance with the determination by the Court of the legal priorities to the leased equipment in issue between these parties."

Its application was dismissed and the appellant appealed that order. Appeal dismissed. The affidavit material filed by the appellant in support of its application was so defective as to be not admissible. The affidavits contained substantial commentary, opinion and scandalous allegations irrelevant to the matters in issue. Some portions of the affidavits dealt with the subject matter of the main action which are not to be resolved on an interlocutory application. The offending material so pervaded the affidavit that it could not be edited out.","The appellant, which had been in receipt of three containers of materials and supplies for the respondent, applied to the Supreme Court for an interlocutory recovery order. The prothonotary granted the order for security for costs. The appellant applied to set aside a recovery order issued by the Prothonotaary. Dismissing the application, that the judge erred in striking the appellant's affidavit from the record and in permitting reference to the respondent's affidavit, which was filed in support of the original recovery order, and in not requiring the respondent to pay the sum in lieu of bond requested by the applicant. The respondent also argued that the prothonaary's affidavit contained rambling narratives and was inadmissible. The court dismissed the appeal. The appeal dismissed."
d_2013skqb59.txt,"The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant. She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse. The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year. The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail. The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children. The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time.","FIAT: The mother wants to change her residence in Saskatoon and move with the children to Kenaston. The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this year and beyond. HELD: 1) The mother's move with them was unfortunate. While she claims she reversed this move and went back to Nokomis, the father harbours suspicions that she and the children actually remained in Kenaston for the next two years. While he was sentenced in October, his latest affidavit is not entirely clear on how long he will be in jail, but states he is eligible for early release in December 2013. These are fact-intensive and there is no presumption in favour of the present custodial parent. The children have access with their father while he is incarcerated.  2) The father is in jail for a number of criminal matters. He was sentenced to incarceration in October. His latest affidavit does not appear to address any of the issues. However, the Court is of the view that the children's best interests are best served by the mother remaining the primary parent for the foreseeable future. There is nothing suggesting the two boys have anything other than a close and loving relationship with her. 3) The Court is cognizant of the fact that the mother's decision to move with her children was not made lightly. There was no evidence that the move would affect the children in any way other than in a very temporary way. There should be some connection maintained. The mother has not truly considered the children' best interests and there was no presumption that they would benefit from the new arrangement. The Court will explore with corrections authorities the prospect of communication through Skype, FaceTime or another means of electronic audio/visual communication. Some form of monitoring might be possible."
2_2005nssc177.txt,"A real estate agent sold a condominium to an American and agreed to rent it for her for a fee. He deposited a security deposit and rent in his personal account and used it for personal living expenses. When the owner inquired, he caused a false lease to be provided to her showing the rental commencing two months later than it actually did; he then failed to remit some rent and was late remitting other rent. He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission. At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible. The Committee gave a written decision outlining the reasons for finding him guilty of five counts of professional misconduct, but failed to provide reasons for the sanctions imposed, which included a two year licence suspension and hearing costs of $10,000. The realtor appealed both the findings of professional misconduct and the sanctions imposed. Applying the standard of review of reasonableness, appeal from the findings of misconduct dismissed; applying the standard of review of correctness, appeal granted on the issue of the sanctions imposed; matter remitted back to the Committee for reconsideration, based on the principles of sanctioning outlined in the decision. It is patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions; reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible as to set out the reasoning process of the tribunal and demonstrate a consideration of all of the relevant factors.","The applicant sought to have her license to trade in real estate suspended for two years. She had been denied the opportunity to rent a condominium due to her brother-in-law's (who resided in Nova Scotia) failing to pay rent. The applicant sought for a review of the commission's fines and found the commission had erred in law by not providing adequate reasons for the decision. Application allowed; the commission imposed sanctions; the applicant's right to hold a license totrade in realty was suspended for a period of two years; the application for a new salesperson license was dismissed; the court imposed sanctions on the applicant for failing to provide adequate reasons to the Commission for the decisions made regarding the commission and its enforcement of the sanctions. The application for an appeal of the Commission's decision was dismissed as not having sufficient reasonableness; the Court adopted the third option, which was to impose the maximum amount of time it took the applicant to reply to the complaints; the Commission was not given sufficient guidance on how it should carry out its task."
e_2002nssc20.txt,"The applicant operated commercial private billiards club with liquor licence and served bar food. The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation. The Municipality refused to issue a letter to the effect that the premises were properly zoned for that purpose, arguing that the proposal would result in a change in use requiring a development agreement. The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use. Application granted; the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change. There was no evidence that the proposal would result in a nuisance or increased traffic, neither of which could be presumed.","The applicant sought an order declaring that the land use by-law of the respondent permits the operation of a licensed billiard club open to the public. The applicant had a special premises liquor license which allowed the sale of liquor, subject to certain restrictions including the establishment's use being a lounge not a public place. The licensing officer for the municipality amended the land-use by-laws to permit the sale and use of liquor to the extent that it required a development permit. The club was operated within the restrictions imposed by the Alcohol and Gaming Authority as a club and its use was significantly different from that of the previous use as a private pool hall. The development officer determined that the club would constitute a change in use requiring a development license and the applicant must proceed to obtain a development agreement. HELD: The applicant's application was granted. The land was subject to a special status quo zoning bylaw which prohibits the establishment of any kind of drinking establishment within the meaning of the By-law. The establishment was a lounge and its license was for the use of members of the club only and not the general public. If the club was to become a 'lounge' it would require a development licence. The application was dismissed. The court found that the applicant had not shown a change of use and that if the proposal did not constitute a 'change in use' it could proceed to the development agreement process. The appeal against the development permit was adjourned."

Immediately after the appointment of the receiver, the supplier presented a written demand for repossession of the books. The receiver refused, claiming that the books were subject to an agreement for sale to the institution's students and therefore, exempt.  A judge of the Supreme Court agreed and the supplier appealed. Appeal allowed; return of books or payment of their value to the supplier ordered. Although the goods were supplied as course materials, the institution's contract with its students obliged it to provide, in its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program and the students acknowledged that it was necessary for the institution to change materials from time to time. The books had not been distributed to the students as of the date of the supplier's demand. The fact that the institution intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide these particular materials. Thus, the books were not subject to any agreement for resale within the meaning of the Act.","This was an appeal by a supplier from the refusal by a receiver to release goods to the supplier pursuant to s. 81.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The single issue was whether the judge erred in finding that the goods were subject to an agreement for sale at arms' length at the time the supplier presented a written demand for repossession. The fact that it intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide those materials. It follows that, as of the date of the supplier's demand, these books were not'subject to any agreement for Sale' within the meaning of s.81.1(1)(c)(v).

HELD: Appeal allowed per oral reasons. The judge held that once ITI had decided what course materials it would use, there was a binding contract to supply those materials to the company. The court also held that ITI retained discretion under its contract with its students regarding what course material it would supply. Thefact that it was obliged by its contract to provide, at its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program did not rise to any obligation for sale within the Meaning of s.(1)(v) and that the judge had erred by finding otherwise."
4_2014skqb177.txt,"Civil Procedure – Pleadings – Statement of Claim – Striking OutCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 7-9 The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants that included three causes of action: a claim against Xtreme Mining and Banga for wrongful dismissal; a claim for defamation brought against Banga; and for inducing breach of contract against Potash Corp. The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial. The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants. Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment. The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation. The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media. HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition. Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time. It allowed the application respecting the pleadings that related to an individual who was not a party and struck the paragraphs in question as irrelevant and immaterial.","The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants, Xtreme Mining & Demolition and Leonard Banga, for wrongful dismissal and inducing breach of contract. The defendants brought three separate causes of action against them, one of which was for defamation. The second cause was for breach ofcontract. The parties agreed to treat the statement of claim as an action and struck it. The Court found that the pleadings to be irrelevant as they were not mere extrinsic evidence. The pleadings were not relevant as they did not relate to the plaintiff's alleged role in the action nor to the issues to be tried.

c_2009nssc180.txt,"At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007). Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009. The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years. The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines. She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it. The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands. Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward. The father's hardship arguments rejected. He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income. The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient. Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied. The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses. During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family.","The mother sought an order for child maintenance retroactive to the date of their separation. The father had made overtures to the mother for increased child support but had resisted such requests. The mother applied for a retroactive award pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act. The court ordered that the father have a responsibility to provide child maintenance for his child. The child had not seen his mother for the past few months and the mother had been paying less than legally required given his income and the dictates of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The parties' income had declined since the separation and the father had not made any further requests for additional child support. The wife now sought retroactive awards for child support retroactive only to the year that the child was born. The son had not been properly cared for since the marriage and the parties' separation. Although the mother's income had diminished since the divorce, the father was making efforts to make an informed decision about child maintenance. The daughter had made an effort to become involved with the father's legal affairs and the support system, but had been unable to find the appropriate person to assist her. The current father has made no effort to assist his son in finding a suitable home. The Court found that the mother was being unreasonable in making her request for additional information and it was inappropriate to make a retroactivity award based on her failure to provide the requested information more than three years ago. The applicant requested a retroaction of the father’s child support payments for a period of 3 years. The Father applied for relief pursuant to The Maintenance and custody Act in October 2007. Consent Order dated January 2009 provided relief to almost all of the issues raised in the proceeding, including ongoing child maintenance beginning January 2008. The defendant remained in arrears with regard to child maintenance payments. The Nova Scotia Maintenance Enforcement Program was in contact with the applicant to make arrangements for repayment of arrearages."

The court found that the evidence found through temporary Internet sites was admissible. The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer. The police had no authority to search the computer generally. They were only authorized to look at the Internet history. The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right. The temporary files created as a result of the visits on the Internet was evidence of Internet history, and because of this connection, this evidence was not excluded.",HELD: The Court held that the exhibits were not entitled to be admitted into the courtroom. The Court found that the accused had not consented to the discovery of the exhibits and that the officer had proceeded to use the assistance request of another officer (who had been assigned to the investigation of the accused's computer) as an amplification evidence. The accused's application to exclude certain evidence discovered by the police during the execution of the search was not allowed to enter into s. 24(2) consideration. The issue of exclusion of evidence pursuant to s.24(2)(a) of the Charter was not determined at the initial voir dire as there had not been any evidence presented of either the nature of the evidence seized nor the location from which it was seized.

He commenced these proceedings against the Defendant seeking damages for a failure to warn him of the danger associated with the use of the paint sprayer. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.  1)The paint sprayer was of the 'airless' type. It operated at 2,500 lbs. pressure. This would not have been appreciated by the ordinarily prudent user. The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn. 2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor. Where an enterprise or activity is inherently dangerous, the duty to warn can not be delegated. In such a situation the party who retains the independent contractor remains vicariously liable. 3)The waiver in the rental contract was ineffective. It was a standard form agreement signed on its face with the terms of the contract on the reverse. 4)The Plaintiff was awarded general damages of $10,000.00, $5,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and recovered $3,789.50 for SHSP. 5)The usual increase in general damages for inflation and pre-judgment interest were both reduced because the Plaintiff had not presecuted his action expeditiously.","The plaintiff rented paint sprayer from a shop. He signed a form of agreement and was told how to clean the gun part of the sprayer after completion of the work. No warning was given respecting any hazards in using the sprayers, and no warning was printed on the agreement. After painting the plaintiff's shop, he experienced difficulties with the gun nozzle. He bounced the sprayering on the floor and turned the switch on and off several times while activating the gun. He pulled the trigger and the spray nozzle began to function. He suffered a slight pain in the hand but was able to function normally for three months. He sought to retain as much of the digit as possible. Accused of negligent negligence, the defendant was liable for the damage suffered by the plaintiff as a consequence of the plaintiff failing to warn prospective renters of the high pressure in the spray. The plaintiff had no reason to be scrupulously careful about the position of his finger because he was unaware of the risk. Damages for pain and suffering and loss ofamenities of life were at $10,000. The defendant was to pay $5,000 plus costs and pre-judgment interest on $10k from January 1, 1990 to December 31, 1990."

An award of $700.00 a month spousal support was not unreasonable having regard for (i) the length of the relationship (approximately fifteen years), (ii) the husband's wage (approximately $55,000.00 per year) and (iii) the fact that the wife had seldom worked outside the home.",The Father's Reliance on Children was Cut Off. The Court found no tenablebasis for interfering with the trial judge's decision to grant custody of the 3 year old to his father. The Judge chose to accept the testimony of the father's expert witness who testified as to relationships within the family over that of Tracy Fick's expert testimony who testified about the effects of abuse on children. The Father also found the mother's interpretation of events not to be credible. The Courts also delayed the judgment to enable us to order liberal access between the day the appeal was heard and today's date as the father had not previously had regular access to the child.
6_2011skqb386.txt,"The tenants were given short written notice to vacate their apartment unit. The tenants applied under the Residential Tenancies Act for the return of their security deposit and damages including moving expenses. The landlord was out of country at the time of the hearing but authorized by letter that the caretaker would attend the hearing to represent the landlord. The caretaker confirmed the tenants endured a protracted plumbing problem and restriction on bathroom use in the apartment. The hearing officer awarded the tenants half of the actual moving cost and 1 year of rent abatement. The landlord appealed the hearing officer's decision. The landlord alleged that he was not given the opportunity to be heard or to adequately respond to the tenants' claim as he received inadequate notice and alleged that the award of damages was unreasonable. HELD: The landlord's appeal was dismissed. 1) The tenant gave notice of his claim by two separate documents and the landlord showed no misapprehension of the tenants' position based on his written response. The landlord did not indicate in his letter that the caretaker had a limited role and the landlord could have sought an adjournment but did not.  2) Section 70(6)(c) of the Act empowers the hearing officer to order payment of damages where the hearing officer considers it just and equitable. The wording of this provision is broad and unconstrained excepting that the nature of damages that may be imposed must not be punitive. The decision on rent abatement was principled and to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space. The award for moving costs was intended to compensate for inconvenience, aggravation and related expenses. The awards were reasonable both in fact and law and no reviewable error was made by the hearing officer. Corrigendum released dated November 15, 2011 and added to fulltext.","The issue before the hearing officer concerned the tenants' claim for damages and return of the security deposit arising out of the landlord's notice to vacate. The tenants were given written notice to leave their apartment on December 3, 2010 for a December 31st termination date. The day of the notice they were advised not to use the bathroom, a water leak had caused a stain on the downstairs units ceiling. The landlord's caretaker was unable to attend on the scheduled hearing date as he was unable attend. The hearing officer accepted the tenants’ evidence on the unusable space and that this evidence represented her findings of fact. The tenant appealed. HELD: The Court held that the decision on rent abatement was made on a principled and logical basis having regard to the facts. The purpose of the award was to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space. The award for moving costs was intended in part to compensate for inconvenience and aggravation, and in part as compensatory loss for related expenses. Both awards were reasonable on both fact and law, accordingly. There was no reviewable error by the hearing officers. The Court found no reviewability error by either award. With regard to damages, the Court concluded that the award of damages was unreasonable because it was an arbitrary award unsupported by any link or connection between the 'improper' termination notice and the tenants loss of using of space. Both awarded damages in part and in parcel. The total amount awarded was $598.92. The court found no breach of the Act or an error by any hearing officer. With respect to the award for the moving costs, the court found that the hearing office was not equipped to process the tenants request a repair order. As the tenant was unable or unwilling to attend, the matter proceeded unfairly without an opportunity for him to be heard."
9_1998canlii12399.txt,"The issue on appeal was reduced to whether the security holder, Lanson, authorized Nickel to sell the mobile home as contemplated by s28(1) or, if not authorized, did he sell the mobile home in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s30(2). Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home. The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson. The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds. Lanson attempted to seize the home. The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.  HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet. The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security. 2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization. Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. 3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.  4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. 5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer. The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.  6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.","The issue on this appeal is the priority of security interest in a mobile home granted by the respondent to the former spouse and subsequent purchaser for value, the Credit Union having regard to the operation of s. 28(1) and s. 30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The facts are not in dispute and are fully set out in the judgment of the trial judge. The trial judge found that the respondent had not authorized the sale of the mobile home and attempted to seize it. The Credit Union resisted seizure and an application was brought before Queen's Bench to find priorities as between the parties. The respondent's security interest continued to take priority over the security interest of the Credit union. HELD: The appellant will have costs in the usual way on double Column V.  1) Section 28(2)(a) contemplates the secured creditor (the lanson) authorizing the debtor to deal with the secured debtor and does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to dealwith the collateral. The fundamental issue is whether the authorization is subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. The appeal judge found in error. The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave the secured party express authority to dealWith the security. That dealing would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditors does not invalidate the sale to the buyer. 2) The appellant relied heavily on Canadian Commercial Bank v. Tisdale Farm Equipment Ltd. (Cuming and Wood, Saskatchewan and Manitoba Personal Property security Acts Handbook). Section 28 (1) provides that a 'dealing' with the security Interest in the collateral unless the secured parties expressly or impliedly authorizes the dealing. In other words the security interests in the corollary to s. 29(1)(the P.P.S.A.) does not continue in the current course of business as contemplated by s.30(2). The Credit union appeals this decision. 3) The issue is reduced to whether the agreement or the conduct of the Lanson/the Credit Union common carrier authorized the resale of the security, the mobilehome. The critical issue is not whether the agreements or the express agreement of the lanson to deal With the Security constitutes a common security agreement.

The amount owing on the mortgage was $61,194.91 as of February 12. In issue was whether the home was a homestead within the meaning of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act when s.44(17) was proclaimed on September 20, 1992. HELD: The application was adjourned to June 7. 1)The homestead provisions of s.44 had no application in this case. The land was not being put to any farming use prior to August 1992 and the respondent's house at the time fell into the category of 'simply a dwelling in isolation' (Bank of Nova Scotia v. Blair). 2)There was no recent appraisal information available. If the respondents have not resolved the debt by sale or refinancing by the return date they will have the onus of providing evidence that the upset price suggested by the applicant should not be included in an order nisi for sale.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order nisi for sale of a 10 acre parcel of land bordering an ostrich farming business. The amount owing on the mortgage which dates back to 1988 was $61,194.91. The Farm Credit Corporation as second mortgagee paid out in the amount of $36,000. The respondents had acquired the 10 mortgaged acres from their father in 1988 and commenced building their home in the summer of 1988. By the time the respondents entered into the subject mortgage on October 4, 1988 they were living in their home on the property. The respondent stated that he was working at construction work in Rosetown and was raising some chickens, turkeys and geese that he had acquired from his father. He also indicated that he hoped to one day buy ostrich farm land. HELD: Application adjourned. 1)The Court found that although the Farm Credit corporation was the second mortgageee in the $61k market price for the ostrich business, it had not established that the land in the period prior to August of 1992 met the definition of farm land and the homestead provisions of s.44 of the Act had no application in this case. 2)The court was not comfortable setting an upset price for a sale at $61 thousand considering the amount the respondents have invested in the property, unless there was no other choice. The Court was not able to find what if any higher price should be set. 3)The respondents were not able, by sale of the property or refinancing, to put the upset price on the return date of providing evidence why the upset Price suggested by the applicant should not be included in an order for sale."

HELD:1)The father was to pay $454 for child support for the two children who lived with the mother. His proportionate share of orthodontic expenses was 86% ($1,677) to be paid by five payments of $280. 2)The respondent's average income over 1994-96 for the purpose of determining child support was $32,243.39. The 1997 income information was not included because the financial evidence was insufficient. 15% of the capital cost allowance was imputed pursuant to s19 for the 1994-96 taxation years. Deducting all of the respondent's capital cost allowance was not a reasonable expense. An adverse inference was not drawn from the failure to produce the financial records of the respondent's farming partner. 3)The applicant's average income for 1994-96 for purposes of calculating the s7 expense was $5,278.40. 4)The father was to pay $1,800 prior to April 30/98 as payment under the 1990 order. 5)The father was ordered to produce the documents referred to in s21 to the applicant by May 1st each year. 6)The applicant was awarded solicitor/client costs of her application to determine the amount of outstanding maintenance owing for 1996 and 1997 and her taxable costs on the balance of the application.","The mother brought a motion for variation of child support pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines.

5_2008nspc12.txt,"A youth was arrested and charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle after the vehicle arrived near the location of a pre-arranged drug transaction. The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear. A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized. The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The strip search was incident to arrest and conducted in a reasonable manner, being reasonably quick and non-invasive. There is nothing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent or guardian prior to a search. This was real evidence, the admission of which would not affect trial fairness; any breach was conducted in good faith; the search was motivated by a sense of urgency; and significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person.","The accused was charged with having in his possession, a stolen motor vehicle, cocaine. The police had earlier determined that the accused would be held overnight and taken to court the following day to be arraigned on a charge of possession of stolen vehicle. The accused had stated that he could get the vehicle back by arranging a drug deal. The officer who conducted the strip search did not observe the accused remove the drugs from the car, nor did he observe the driver undress. The only thing that could be discernible from the officer's videotaped testimony was that the officer had asked the accused if he could remove his clothing from the vehicle and that he had removed his underwear. The Crown and the defence agreed that the evidence was to form part of the trial proper. The Court found that the strip-search was conducted for the purpose of preserving evidence, namely, the evidence of the accused's alleged possession of drugs. The evidence was found to be relevant to the wider purpose of the search, namely to prevent the loss or destruction of drugs, and to prevent its disposal by the accused. The Act requires that all persons with a legal or moral record be privy to the search. The search was conducted in a manner that preserved the integrity of the law and, in the event of a Charter breach, the law would remain open. The court found that although the accused had indicated that he was not aware of the location of the cocaine, the search was motivated by a degree of urgency and necessity to prevent it being found in the area where it was likely to be found. The strip search was not intrusive and the evidence gathered was relevant to that totality of circumstances surrounding the arrest. The arrestee was not made aware of his or her prior knowledge of the locations of the drugs or of their transportation or of the reasons for the search until the very last minute. The law is clear that the search is conducted to preserve evidence and prevent its destruction. The administration of justice was at risk in the absence of the evidence. The judicial burden is on the accused, the defence, to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the admission of evidence would bring the administration of Justice into disrepute. In the event that a Charter violation occurs, the court will impose a judgment that the administration is in disreputes. The burden is also on the Crown to establish on balance of probability that the admissions of the drug located on the person of the Court's own daughter would render the trial unfair. The Supreme Court of Canada's pronouncements in Collins apply the framework established"
9_2014skpc205.txt,"There was contradictory evidence regarding the central issue of consent and therefore the court had to assess credibility. The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment. The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent. The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister. Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication. It was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused is charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The charge arises from sexual activity that occurred between the accused and the complainant in December 2012. The complainant has no memory of the sexual activity due to an alcohol induced blackout. The Crown argues that there was no consent. The accused does not deny that he had sex with the complainant. He claims that the activity was consensual or, alternatively, that he has an honest but mistaken belief in consent. HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty. The Court considered contradictory evidence with respect to the central issue of consent, an assessment of credibility, which is to be assessed in light of all the evidence. It is open to the accused to claim that the complainant's words and actions, before and during the incident, raise a reasonable doubt against her assertion that she, in her mind, did not want the sexual touching to take place. As the Court heard contradictory evidence regarding the central issues of consent and credibility, this case involves an assessment in lightof all the information having regard to the principles established by R. v. W.(D.), 1991 CanLII 93 (1991) 1 SCR 742. Consent is an essential component of both the actus reus and mens rea. If the activity were consensual, there was nothing to be done about it. If not, he lacked the mens for sexual assault. Hears contradictory evidence from the defence witnesses regarding the complainant and the accused's behaviour. The defence witnesses raised reasonable doubt about her non-consent and whether she had an honest or mistaken belief that consent."

The plane crashed in Nova Scotia and the plaintiff, claiming negligence by the defendants in the manufacture of the parts, commenced an action in Nova Scotia. The defendants applied to declare Nova Scotia forum non conveniens. Dismissing the application, that there is a real and substantial connection to both jurisdictions and the plaintiff's forum choice appeared reasonable and should not be disturbed.","The plaintiff alleged that in 1988 he purchased aircraft parts from the defendants, such parts being parts being PA-11 fuselage. The defendant was in the business of manufacturing and selling such parts in Wisconsin, USA, and Nova Scotia. The aircraft crashed in August 1992, and the plaintiff alleges the crash was due to faulty and substandard materials used by the defendant in the manufacture or construction of the PA-12 package. The defendants applied to have the Originating Notice and Statement of Claim set aside as this Court has no jurisdiction and the action stayed on the basis of forum conveniens. Forum non conveniens are those who suggest a forum other than the court's own jurisdiction. Here the plaintiff had no business being in the U.S. and his knowledge of the fuselage was not one that he reasonably ought to have had in his contemplation when he so tendered his goods."

She sued three members of the clinic staff, including the doctor who performed the abortion, alleging negligence in letting her drive after the abortion. Awarding the plaintiff $724,000 for past and future loss of income, future loss of pension, and general damages, that based on the evidence of the possible complications from surgery such as an abortion, and considering the emotional impact of an abortion on all women, the defendants breached their standard of care as health care professionals in permitting the plaintiff to drive after the abortion.","The plaintiff nurse brought an action against the defendants for negligent driving. She alleged that the defendant doctors, who performed the abortion on the plaintiff, encouraged her to take the sedative drug sedative because it would relax her and relieve her of the pain of the abortion procedure. The female plaintiff also testified that she suffered a delayed vasovagal reaction which resulted in her having to take sedative drugs for two hours after the procedure. She also testified about the difficulty of driving after the abortion. The plaintiff was given an order for an opinion on liability. The opinion was that the plaintiff should have been allowed to drive. The order was directed to include a reference to the female plaintiff as a party. The court found that the female doctor was not aware that she was permitted to drive and that she had been advised against it by her employer. The male doctor testified that he worked at the Halifax Clinic and that he was concerned about the fact that the patient was permitted into the clinic after the operation.

e_2007skca122.txt,"This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Madam Justice Rothery who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant against the respondents, Bjorkdale Lions Club and the Village of Bjorkdal. The action arose out of burns suffered by the respondent while participating in a demolition derby run by the Bjorkdell Lions Club with the assistance of the Bjorksdale Fire Department. The fire department was standing by in the sense that it had a fire truck parked nearby and had some of its members in attendance. Who attempted to put out the fire with a fire extinguisher was not established, but there was a fire apparatus nearby and it malfunctioned while others were in the midst of taking action to smother the fire.

The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors. A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders. The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board. HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw. There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners. Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting.

d_2013skpc56.txt,"The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.","The accused was convicted of possession for the purposes of trafficking cocaine. The accused had served his youth probation order by failing to attend a youth court on a charge of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The youth had been in La Ronge for three months prior to this offence and had sold cocaine to undercover officers for $4,250. The Crown had refused to release the accused on a conditional discharge. The Court sentenced the accused to a six month deferred custody and supervision order on all three counts. The court found that with this not being a violent offence and with his limited criminal record the accused was not subject to custody under either s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The aggravating factors were the accused's possession of 76 grams of cocaine, the amount of which was used to trafficking the cocaine, his contact with the youth and his desire to sell the cocaine to the officers. The evidence indicated that the accused had been cruising around Kikinaahk Friendship Centre which is the main gathering place for older children and adolescents in LaRonge and that the youth had stopped selling cocaine within 1 month. The police had arrested the accused when they approached him about selling the cocaine. HELD: The accused was sentenced to a 6 month deferred detention and supervision ordered on all 3 counts. He was subject to a sentence of 6 months deferred custody which included 12 months probation. The offence was declared an exceptional case and the accused would be released on a probation order with conditions, including that he not sell the drug to the police or consume alcohol or drugs for the duration of the order and that he would not attend any youth court meetings or parties scheduled to be held in Laronge for the foreseeable future.

The matter should not be decided summarily where there are questions of fact or law. The hail damage may allow the tenants to claim in damages against the landlord but it could not be construed as a debt due for the purposes of s27 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The remaining alleged breaches could not be determined summarily.  3)Costs of the application were awarded to the landlord in any event of the cause.","The landlord applied for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act.

The applicant alleged the respondents were in arrears of rent by more than 2 months and in breach of their covenant to obtain and maintain suitable insurance up to and including the winter months. The applicants had installed two new stalls in the barn and the applicant admitted the payment due May 1998 was not made because there was a pre-condition to the lease wherein the husband promised to repair damagto the premises in a good husband like manner but because there were problems with the damagraeto the barn which had never properly been repaired and manure buildup in the calf barn. The application was adjourned for a trial.Hail damage claims in excess of $1,000 were allowed in excess in 1998. The claim for repair in excess was for a debt due to the landlord by the landlord. The claims for repair were far in excess what were provided for in clause 3.1 of the lease. The defendants were entitled to awrit of possession.

3_2000skqb75.txt,"The applicant sought to vary the 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing spousal support of $2,500 per month. The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP. Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed. HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.  1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.  2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension. 3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions. However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired. The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home. She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property. The economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account (Moge). There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. 4)No costs.","The applicant applied to vary a February 1, 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing his obligation to pay further spousal support. The amount he was required to pay under the 1995 judgment was $2,500 per month. The applicant lost his employment and a debilitating leg injury. HELD: 1)The respondent had not remarried and had not received any employment income. The Agreement reached by the parties in 1995 did not provide that spousals were either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in the future financial positions of the parties. Surely at the time the agreement was made, the parties had contemplated their eventual retirement and the financial consequences that it would have for each of them. Yet it is not likely that the parties intended spousAL support to continue indefinitely at $2500 per monthly even after the applicant retired. 2)The applicant had gone to considerable lengths to project his retirement income. Because most of it consists of tax sheltered investments, the tax consequences to him were substantial. He estimated that he will be required to draw $7,733 per month from those investments in order to maintain his standard of living and continue to pay the respondent $2.500 permonth. He sought the advice of a certified financial planner respecting the implications of converting his RRSPs into RRIFs, Locked-In Retirement Accounts (LIRA's), Life Income Funds (LIF's) and Locked-in Retirement Income Funds. 3)The application was based on future projections rather than on established fact.

The respondent could also supplement his own income by selling his residence and purchasing some form of annuity."
c_2002skqb47.txt,"FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store. The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43. The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused. The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to. The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports. At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs. Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party. 2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages. 3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value. Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case. Expenses of each was examined separately. In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant. 4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee. A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel. The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court. It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant. Costs payable by the plaintiff on an interlocutory application may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs.",FIAT. An application to determine the issue of costs. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim. The plaintiff's second counsel was experienced and the plaintiff requested a fee of 50 percent of the first counsel fee. HELD: 1)The expert medical evidence introduced by the plaintiff could only be found to be of marginal value. The greater damages claimed related to the pain disorder.  2)The plaintiff's first counsel was experience and could have handled the trial without difficulty. His evidence was of considerable value to the Court in reconciling and comparing the evidence of medical experts of a particular specialty field with the plaintiff's own medical evidence. His clinical findings tend to parallel those of the expert medical reports prepared by the defendant. His fees were not excessive. 3)Costs payable by the party to the successful party on interlocutory applications may be deducted from the plaintiff’s Bill of Costs.
4_2004skqb516.txt,"The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search. The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.  1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid. That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2) The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued. The search was therefore warrantless. 3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair. 4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis. 5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter.","The accused was charged with two search warrants issued pursuant to s. 487 of the Criminal Code and s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The search was conducted in the accused's residence as a result of several months of investigation. The RCMP and RCMP officers were in attendance and noticed movement inside the accused’s residence. The accused was in the hallway when the RCMP and Cpl. Olberg approached the door. The police heard movement inside and after waiting approximately 2 minutes he and the accompanying officers heard the door open and the accused was standing in the entrance hallway. The following day they conducted search of the accused residence and found a suitcase containing $750,000.00 Canadian cash and some American cash and other recreational vehicles were found in the common area. The Court reviewed the various search warrants and found that the only warrant issued was invalid. The court concluded that both the Code and CDSA warrants were invalid. It was therefore invalid for the Court to determine the validity of the search. The items seized during the search ought to be excluded as evidence at his upcoming trial by virtue of s. 24(2) of the Charter. The Crown argued that only if both warrants are found to be invalid is s.24 of the Code. HELD: The Court found that both warrants were valid. The evidence obtained as a consequence of the investigation was sufficient to support the conclusion that the search was a warrantless search. As the accused had clearly indicated that his provisions, being initially authorized in another province, were authorized for execution in that province, he had clearly stated that his intent was to obtain drugs. The contents of the suitcase containing the cash and the drugs were found to have been obtained by means of a search of his residence. Further, the Court found it was not necessary to search the premises for drugs. In addition, the court found that there was no evidence that the accused, who had been charged with the most serious offences, had obtained the drugs by mistake. The remainder of the evidence was irrelevant as it did not provide the necessary information to support an endorsement that the warrant was invalid and was not clearly endorsed by the Court. The Committee concluded that the endorsement was appropriate. The remaining evidence was insufficient to determine whether the search warrants were constitutional. The application for exclusion was dismissed."
5_2011nspc8.txt,"The defendant entered into a plea agreement to a charge of sexually assaulting his young son but, shortly before the sentencing hearing, he applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he had not been fully informed of the nature of the allegations, partly due to a communication issue (English was not his first language) and partly because he had not viewed the video of his son's statement to the police prior to the plea. He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son. The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography. Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed; the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault. The defendant's motivation for pleading guilty did not alter his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation nor his understanding that he was, by his plea, admitting to that allegation.","The accused plead guilty to a sexual assault of his son. The Crown alleged the offences occurred at his home when his wife was at work. The accused was at home when the alleged occurred. He was charged with sexual assault and his son was at his residence when the accused was shown pornography on a computer. The video of the alleged assault was shown to the victim. The victim came out of his bedroom, dressed in his pajamas, wanting a drink of water. The assault was alleged to have occurred between January 2006 and December 2007. The evidence related to the accused's ability to communicate in English and purported admission of the offence and an expression of remorse were not found credible by the Court. The Court was not persuaded that the accused had a lack of knowledge or understanding of the nature of the allegation when he pled guilty to the sexual assault."
b_1998canlii12364.txt,"The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult. The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue. The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult. The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989. The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court. The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision. It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court. Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.  1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges. If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth. The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.  2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application. R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts.","The accused was charged with two offences contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and two acts of sexual assault contrary to ss.155 and s.246 of the S.16 Code. He was convicted of sexual abuse, sodomy and incest. The Crown alleged the offences occurred when the accused was a young person. The Youth Court judge dismissed the evidence as being of a young offender. The Provincial Court judge did not inquire of the parties whether any of them wished to make a transfer application before accepting a guilty plea. HELD: The appeal court judge was set aside and the matter remitted to a youth court to be heard according to law. In the circumstances, either party may apply to a Youth Court Judge for an order under s.16 of the Act to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.  1)The Youth Court is the ideal vehicle for the youth court judge to make determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear charges. 2)The jurisdiction of the Youth Court should be determined by s.5(1) of the Criminal Code. It does not depend on averments in the information or on proof of age. The principles set out in R. v. A. (E.A.) are applicable and the Court will give precedence to the public interest. 3)The Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge was not in the circumstances prepared to assume jurisdiction on the basis of the evidence. He nor the Crown could find a direct connection between the accused's age and the alleged offences. The Court would have preferred to hear these matters in an ordinary court."
d_2010skqb173.txt,"The petitioner and respondent are the parents of twins. The petitioner father sought variation of a consent order. The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent. The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner. The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children. For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time. The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children. The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis. The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come. The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children. HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement. The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children. The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement. The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order. The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased. The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed. The respondent was awarded costs.","FIAT The petitioner applies to vary the consent parenting judgment and the consent child support order. The parties were the parents of twins born August 28, 2005. The petitioner and the respondent had never lived together. The respondent moved to Saskatoon with the twins in 2005. In October 2005 the petitioner brought an application for joint custody with the children having their primary residence with the respondent and an order that the respondent provide her three previous years tax returns and notices of assessment. That application resulted in the consent and parenting judgment. The child support ordered determined that the petitioner's income for Guideline purposes was $53,624 and the petitioner was ordered to pay $762 per month plus one half of net child care costs and one half for any health or dental costs not covered by insurance. The parenting judgment provided that the child would have access 50% of the time and that the mother's income on equal parenting would increase by $22,479. HELD: The application to vary is dismissed. The court cannot retry the case, substituting its discretion for that of the original judge; it must assume the correctness of the decision and consider only the change in circumstances since the order was issued. The petitioner has failed to meet the onus upon him in this regard. The Court dismissed the application. 1)There was no material change of circumstance as the change of the petitioner’s income on the equal parenting arrangements was clearly provided for in the original child support orders and the parenting judgment, although the change was significant. The two parties had been paying child support in the amount of $1,072 per month for the past 3 years. The father was able to access family supports after the twins were born in Regina. The mother was able also to access support after the second child was born in Saskatoon. 2)There had not been a material change in the circumstances of the child since the birth of the twins. The only change was the petitioner husband’ s income which had increased by $2,479 due to the change. The wife was able only to access half of the children in the interim period. The husband was able access half the time. The children’ll have access to the petitioner 50% the time but the cost of the them’d care on that occurring was dealt with in the initial order. 3)The petitioner owed the respondent $420 for child support as he appears to have paid only the original $762 basis per month.

In issue were custody and access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)Divorce was granted. The parties, married 19 years, had been living separate and apart since January 1998. 2)They agreed to joint custody of both children. The son was to reside primarily with his father. The daughter resided with her mother. Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends. The children were to be together most weekends. School vacations would be shared. 3)The father was to pay monthly child support of $485 based on his gross salary of $61,200 which included a $1500 car allowance. Expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities did not qualify as a special or extraordinary expense. The father was to contribute his proportionate share (73% to reflect spousal maintenance) of orthodontic expenses not covered by insurance. 4)Spousal maintenance of $900 was to be reviewable after December 31, 2003. The mother's job advancement was impeded as a result of the marriage, specifically by frequent moves to accommodate her husband's job transfers. She had worked out of the home for limited income to facilitate child rearing. 5)The parties agreed the matrimonial home would be sold and proceeds divided equally after payment of expenses of the sale. Costs of any major repairs were to be split equally pending the sale. The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.  6)It was inferred the value of the chattels was the same as that at the date of the marriage. It would be inequitable to order a distribution of chattel property given as antiques or heirlooms by her parents valued in excess of $6,000. The inheritance from her aunt who died almost a year after the separation was excluded. The motor vehicles were divided in accordance with their value as of October 2000. All other matrimonial property and debts and obligations were valued as of the date of the petition. RRSPs were to be equalized as of October 15, 1999 by rollover. 7)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of his pension at date of the petition to a locked in RRSP in the name of the petitioner. The balance in excess of the maximum amount transferable under the Pension Benefits Act resulted in an adjustment of $2,042.75. The respondent was to assume any debts.  8)No costs were awarded.","The marriage was established as a result of the marriage's tumultuous divorce. The mother had been employed as a day care coordinator for many years and the father as a bank director until his death in 1999. The parties had agreed on joint custody of their two children, aged 9 and 11 years. The father was to pay $900 per month in child support and $13,666.75 as spousal maintenance. The wife sought to have the children's primary residence divided equally. The husband was ordered to convey one-half of the commuted value of the mother's home to a locked-in RRSP in the wife's name and to designate the children as beneficiaries of his life insurance for a period of time as determined in the Divorce Act. The court allowed the parties to vary the amount of spousals payable in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines.

For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis.

Current parenting arrangement to remain in effect with the parties retaining joint custody of the children; table amount of child support set. The parenting pattern followed for the past five years had been working well for the children and appeared to be serving their needs; the mother's proposal would lessen the children's time with their father and the father's proposal would also create a significant change for the children, removing their current home base.","The court granted the divorce on the grounds of a breakdown of the marriage and the fact that the parties had lived separate and apart for more than a year prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The court also found that the parents' parenting time had been consistently shared by the father with the exception of Remembrance Day, when the children were in the father's care. The father now sought to vary his parenting time so that he and the wife would equally share their time with the children. He proposed that the current arrangement create a shared custody arrangement in which the father would retain the interest he acquired in his own pension and the mother would be designated as joint custodian of the children for the duration of the child care trial. The parties had been equally sharing the parenting time for the last five years. The Court found that both parties had had a consistent pattern in their interaction with the other, and that the observed variation in parenting time was detrimental to the children's academic or social life. The current arrangements were in effect with the exceptions of Rememance Day and Christmas. The parents agreed to joint custody of the 5 year olds. The mother sought to have the father make child support payments in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines by paying a table amount in accordance each his income and by making a contribution to the child day care cost in accordance to their respective incomes. HELD: The court ordered that the child support payable by the mother be divided equally between the parties. The expense to the mother was actually less than $800 per month and the father was ordered to pay $647 per month beginning June 1, 2006. The child care expenses were to be determined by the Court as follows: 1) the father had access every second weekend; 2) the cost of child care was set aside for the child such that the children would spend less time with either parent on a weekly basis; 3) the parents were to alternate Remembrance day. The more specific decision on parenting time, the more restrictions are placed in the way of the parents continuing their successful performing of this function. The application for leave to appeal the decision on this issue was granted in respect of the mother's request to have her leave to move with the child to a different city; 4) the costs of establishing a shared parenting arrangement were ordered to be ordered in respect to the remainder of the year; 5) the mother had chosen not to participate in the child's school activities which would create a significant change to the father and would create conflict in the childrens' lives; and 6) the"
2_2009nssc364.txt,"The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008. It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time. At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment. The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support. He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement. The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce. The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008). The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable. He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife. The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement. This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act. It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome). The terms of the agreement must be given great deference. Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act? The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made. Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult. Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated. Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party. To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them. The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it. The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements. His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).","The parties married in 1995 and separated in 2006. They have four children, all of whom are now in a shared parenting arrangement. In 2008, the parties entered a separation agreement that provided for a shared parental arrangement. The children have been primarily resident with the respondent mother. In 2009, business pressures forced the respondent to move away from the shared parenting arrangements and into an arrangement whereby he sees his children less frequently. The respondent now seeks to have the spousal and child support obligations reflected in a paragraph of the 2008 separation agreement changed in as much as he seeks a corollary relief judgment that would not contain this obligation. The corollaries relief order issued under the Divorce Act does not create an inconsistency. The Court reviewed the circumstances at the time the agreement was signed and found that the respondent had suffered a dramatic drop in income and no longer in a sharing parenting arrangement; the parties' income had increased; the Court was able to find that the spOUSAL and child child support obligation was met with after-tax income by the respondent and that she was at risk of losing her program of study if the respondent discontinues or does not resume payment of spousals. The petitioner had entered a shared custody arrangement with her son and had been paying $2,000 per month as spousousal support since the separation. She had been financing her education by managing her spousa support; other child related government income and student loan income; and the respondent's spousum. The parties' home was now being used as a storage and storage space for the petitioner's children. The petition for divorce was filed September 15, 2009. The court reviewed the corollars of the separation agreement and found the respondent was entitled to spousic and child spousary support in the amount of $2k per month. The order was set aside."
e_2004skpc101.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time.

This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry. 2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children. There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this. 3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking. As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused. 3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence.",HELD: The application was dismissed. There was no Charter breach. The reason for the delay was that there was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. The accused had not suffered actual prejudice. The conditions of release he was subject to were not soerous as to result in any significant prejudice. There were no errors made by the accused in the questioning. The delay was not caused by any of the factors listed in Morin. The cause was simply the accused’s failure to obtain the requested information.

The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application. The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents. The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child. The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make. HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child. The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent. The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents. The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's. Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan. The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain. The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina. The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime. The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend. The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays. The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two. The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year. Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days. The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement.","HELD: The court held that it could not resolve the custody issue between the parties as it was a matter of factly and expeditiously. The court found that the petitioner was a competent and loving mother. The child was also remarkably resilient in coping with the parent's separation and conflict. The petitioner had a traditional residence with two bedrooms, one for the petitioner and one for her children. The respondent was to have one bedroom, one bathroom and one bedroom with an additional bedroom. The parents' relationship was marked by domestic disharmony. The children were exposed to this throughout their lives. The Court found that both parents were capable of providing a stable and nurturing home for the child. The primary residence was in Moose Jaw, which is where the petitioner currently resides. The petitioner described herself as a stay at home mother. She described her role as a parent as being to watch the children while they were in school and to provide support and encouragement to the petitioner in the mother's role. The mother's assessment was high-handed and suggested some considerable negativity existed at the date of separation. The shared parenting regime has worked well while the petitioner is a pre-schooler. However, this coming September Madison will be five years old and will commence school on a regular basis. The inevitable decision as to where Madison will attend school is imminent."

The plaintiff claims that the spreader was entirely unfit for spreading compost and did not meet the warranties imposed by The Agricultural Implements Act. The plaintiff claimed judgment for the purchase price and damages for repairs to the spreader. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. The plaintiff did not establish that the spreader was not fit for the purpose of spreading compost or that it was not manufactured in compliance with the warranties in the Act. 1) Other than the fact of a chain breakage on two separate occasions, there was no evidence produced by the plaintiff addressing the cause of breakage. 2) If deficiencies did exist in the spreader, the dealer or distributor are expressly entitled to an opportunity to repair or correct the deficiencies, upon receipt of notice in writing. The defendants were deprived of the opportunity to inspect and repair by the unreasonable actions of the plaintiff in his failure to allow the return of the spreader. 3) The plaintiff did not establish that written notice was provided to the defendants as required by s. 36.3(b) of the Act. The Court could not find that the dealer or distributor led the purchaser to believe that the notices were not required to be given pursuant to s. 36.3 of the Act.","The plaintiff purchased a new Meyer Manure Spreader, Model 5570 from the defendant Apollo Distributing Corporation (Apollo).

Costs are awarded to the defendant. The plaintiff has not established to a balance of probabilities that the Spreaders was not fit for the purpose of spreading compost nor manufactured in compliance with the warranties contained in the Act; the plaintiff has failed to take corrective action with respect to this unit.  1) The plaintiff was not required to make written representations as to the nature of the issues, their respective conduct, to the court, or to the purchaser. 2) The defendant did not provide written notice to the plaintiff. The defendant was not a party to the action.

5_2012skqb544.txt,"The accused was charged with second degree murder and two counts of aggravated assault. The accused made an O'Connor application for third party records relating to the two surviving Crown witnesses. In particular, the accused sought disclosure of police reports, videotaped evidence, witness statements, warned statements regarding the multiple arrests and charges incurred by the victims and disclosure of their criminal records. In 2012 SKQB 543, the Court ordered production of the records. This decision deals with whether the documents should be produced to the accused. HELD: The documents were disclosed to the accused. The judge vetted the documents to black out words, phrases or numbers that have no probative value or where the privacy interest of the witness would have been unjustifiably affected.",HELD: The court granted the application. It found the issue of disclosure only and the manner in which the documents and the information contained can be used in examination or cross-examination of the witnesses at trial was not determined. The court also ordered the disclosure of all the documents pertaining to two alleged victims of aggravated assaults and in particular offences for which the two individuals had previously been convicted. The Crown also sought updated criminal records for each of the accused. The Court also directed the Crown to provide updated criminal files to counsel for each party. The accused's interest in obtaining disclosure for the purpose of making full answer and defence outweighed any residual privacy interest held by third parties in the material.
d_2011skqb62.txt,"The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon. The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants. At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience. No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon. The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed. The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon. The Crown appeal was dismissed.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon contrary to s. 90 of the Criminal Code. The Crown appeals on the grounds that the learned trial judge misapprehended the evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. The crown submits that the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence and seeks conviction on the charge. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Crown argues that the sword should have been found by the trial judge to be a prima facie weapon, in the same manner that a firearm, or brass knuckles or other inherently dangerous items are considered weapons. On this basis, sword would be distinguished from knife, which is not necessarily weapon. 2) The trial judge was aware that it was readily available in novelty stores. As he had no bag or back pack in which to carry it, he tucked it into his shorts. He did not usually carry a weapon for protection. The police officer drew his firearm and told the accused to place his hands on his head. He also stated that in his opinion the sword was a novelty sword. No attempt was made by the Crown to call evidence to contradict his testimony. The accused testified that he was unsure why he purchased the sword. He testified at the trial that he had just purchased the weapon. He said he probably just wanted to put it on display. He didn't say anything about it being a decorative item. No attempts were made by him to contradict him. 3) The judge was able to find that the argument that the accused had not given the accused sufficient assistance to explain his decision to buy the sword or to assist the police officer in the identification of the items that he recognized were likely to be available for purchase. The case law clearly establishes that a person with a general knowledge of the subject matter, such as the definition of a weapon, should be able to articulate that knowledge to the jury. The trial court also ignored the fact that the Crown had not established that the expert evidence presented by the defence was irrelevant to the trial decision on the issue of whether the sword is a weapon within the meaning of s.90 of the Code. In this case, the trial court ignored the evidence of the Crown's expert witness who had a similar education and experience as the person who had been introduced to the subject. The judge properly placed the expert witness's evidence in the context of the issues she had to address."
b_2006skqb183.txt,"The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years. The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","The plaintiffs sued for damages arising from alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the Emerald Park Golf and Country Club. The plaintiffs live adjacent to one another and abut the ninth hole of the golf course. The golf course was owned and operated by the defendant, Emerald Park. In 1997, the defendant entered an agreement with the Town to open up the land beside the golfcourse for residential development. The defendants, based in White City, sought injunctive relief to prevent them from operating the ninth and current hole of their golf course which was being used by the plaintiffs. The plaintiff contended that the defendants were negligent in design and management of the course and were negligent for allowing the errant golf balls to enter their property. HELD: The Court granted the injunntctive relief in the amount of $6,000. The defendant were ordered to pay the plaintiffs $8,000 for the loss of use and enjoyment of their property for the next seven months and to pay $6.5 million to the plaintiffs for the costs of the litigation. The Court refused to order the specific course of action that the defendant should take to remedy the problem."

The sentence of imprisonment was increased from 5 to 10 years. The applicant, on advice of two counsel, did not initially seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. He changed his mind 2 years later and sought an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal. The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision. HELD: The application was dismissed without prejudice to reapply should leave to appeal be granted. 1)The application was premature. The application pending before the SCC was likely to be determined within 3 to 4 months.

Some grounds for appeal would clearly fail such as the ground the Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment.

Throughout, the applicant was represented by senior counsel Mr. S. Halyk Q.C. The applicant decided not to seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court on any of the more substantial grounds and instead applied to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to Appeal on one or more of the grounds raised in the proceedings. HELD: The application for release was dismissed. The Court of appeal declined to grant leave to continue the application for the duration of the appellant's detention. The prospective appeal as a whole was not frivolous and the applicant's continued detention for the time being was not necessary in the public interest. The present release of the applicant would be inimical to the public good, given the history of the past proceedings, the current state of the present proceedings and the likelihood of the successful completion of either of the specified specified terms of the sentence."

Although advertising is a form of expression and falls within the scope of sec. 2(b) of the Charter, the purposes of the by-laws (maintaining a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown, minimizing adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reducing safety concerns) were both pressing and substantial and the limiting measures were rationally connected to the objectives.

The plaintiff also sought a declaration that it holds builders' liens against the defendant's interest in the Well and other joint interest assets to the extent of the debts due. Duce Oil denies liability for any costs of the horizontal well in excess of $447,535 being 110% of the authorization for expenditure executed with respect to the Well. The defendant counterclaimed on the basis the plaintiff conducted certain operations without authority, was negligent in conducting operations and overcharged or made improper charges in its accounting procedures. HELD: 1)Duce was liable for $96,286.95 representing 35% of the unpaid costs of the original and supplemental authorization for expenditures (AFE) and the costs of the screw pump. 2)Duce was responsible for $49,701.61 representing regular lifting and production costs and other joint interest wells plus expenditures under $25,000 which did not require an AFE. 3)Coachlight was only entitled to interest from the time of its written notice on June 20/94 that it was exercising its option under the CAPL 1981 to charge interest. 4)In default of payment within 90 days of Judgment the plaintiff would be entitled to a builders' lien in the entire estate or interest of the defendant in all petroleum, natural gas and other hydrocarbons except coal and valuable stone, upon or under the lands as specified together with all proceeds from the defendant's interests in petroleum and natural gas and its interest in fixtures, machinery, tools, appliances and other property in any of the defendant's oil or gas wells on those lands. 5)The totality of the evidence did not support the portrayal by the defendant of the plaintiff as a high handed, arrogant operator who simply forgot it had a minority partner.  6)The plaintiff was entitled to its taxable costs.","The plaintiff invoiced the defendant for its share of the $681,955.58 costs associated with the Horizontal Well but the defendant refused to pay the whole amount. The plaintiff sought an order requiring the defendant to pay $49,701.61 representing 35% of the regular lifting and production costs of all joint interest wells under the Operating Agreement and a declaration that it holds a builders' lien against the defendant's interest in the Well and other joint interest assets to the extent of the debts due. HELD: The defendant was to pay all costs associated the Horizont Well plus $49.61 for the Phillips 66 joint interest well. Costs in excess of $1 million were incurred. The defendant's claim that the plaintiff conducted certain operations without authority, was negligent in conducting operations and overcharged or made improper charges in its accounting is dismissed. Costs were to be determined by the court in the issue of whether the operator was liable for 35% or 35%of screw pump costs incurred after the Default Notice. The court relied primarily on Clause 301 of the CAPL 1981. Clause 301 provides that the operator is delegated the control and management of the exploration, completion and maintenance of the wells and the operation of the equipment. The Court agreed that the defendant was liable, but held that it was not liable for the costs of the Phillips66 well as the associated maintenance and operation costs. The defendants were jointly-operating of a vertical well on a parallel well on the same line as the Hor horizontal Well. The joint interest proved to be a horizontal well. The Phillips 66 well bore was a vertical one. The horizontal length of leg one was approximately 230 metres. It was of sufficient length to cover the difference in the bore length between the vertical and horizontal lengths. The graph showing the bore bore length was approximately 140 metres. The vertical length of the leg two was approximately 240 metres. This was approximately 20 metres of its horizontal length within the target zone, but the end of the well bore and the majority of its vertical length were within the water bearing Marley formation. The plaintiffs' claim that they were jointly jointly-operated and entitled to information concerning the Horvago well was dismissed. The claim that there was a builders lien was also dismissed. As the defendant had not received the requested information regarding the value of the assets under the CAPLY 1981, it was left to the plaintiff to decide what to do with the remaining monies."
6_2003skqb61.txt,"FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001. Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc. The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000. Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship. The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4). Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment. The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate. Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not. To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1).","FIAT: This application by two siblings to act as personal decision-maker and property guardian for their 68-year old mother was opposed by the Public Trustee insofar as they request they be appointed property guardians without the necessity of a bond. The Public Trustees were not served with notices of application for property guardianship and did not intervene in such applications. One answer was to request the public trustee to become the property guardian pursuant to s30(b). The fees charged by the public trustees are set out in Regulation to The Public Guardian and Trustee Act and are not to be used in any fashion. Whether prior consultation with the public board takes place or not, the onus is on the person making an application for the property guardianscy without the necessary of a Bond to persuade the court that it is appropriate, bearing in mind the object of the legislation which is to ensure that the adult's estate is always available for the adult’s ongoing care. Leave is granted to the applicants to supplement the existing material should they see fit to do so."
6_1999canlii12377.txt,"A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second. Two passengers were knocked unconscious. One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty. His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances. The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield. The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision. It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.  1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3). The right of way, however, is not absolute. As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor. It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on. Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor. Alcohol was not a factor. Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights. 3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","This was a charge of failing to yield contrary to s. 50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The defendant stopped at an intersection for 15 seconds to allow several south-bound vehicles to go by, and then began his left turn. When he turned right, any vehicle which was nearby would have been able to avoid the collision. The plaintiff's passenger was knocked unconscious and received a cut to the head requiring three or four stitches. The driver was found not guilty. The court found that the defendant had the right of way and that when he commenced his turn, any car lawfully approaching from the opposite direction would have able to avoided the collision as well."

The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity. There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council. There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided. No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election. The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding. The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made. To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process. 2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair. A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter.","FIAT: The applicants seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing and restraining the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution passed by the Board on May 7, 2007 that the Wilcox Public School be closed effective August 15, 2007. The grounds for the application are that the Board provided inadequate notice of an election for the Wilco school community council and it is alleged the election is nullity. As result there was no council for the Board to consult with as required by The Education Act, 1995. The court also notes that the respondent failed to comply with the requirements of procedural fairness in the manner in which they proceeded to pass the resolution closing the school. HELD: A preliminary review of the facts and law does not suggest a strong prima facie case. The application is dismissed."
2_2004skqb62.txt,"FIAT: The issue to be resolved was whether the petitioner had produced all relevant financial information in order for the Court to determine the amount of maintenance to be paid by her. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs in the amount of $500 to the petitioner. Neither the petitioner's father nor the petitioner's husband was a party to the proceedings. To require them to produce their financial records, in the absence of even the slightest evidence such production would disclose anything which would in any manner assist in determining the amount of child maintenance payable by the petitioner, would be totally unjust.","FIAT. When the 1999 judgment was amended to provide that the primary residence of the child should be with her father, the question of the payment of maintenance by the mother was adjourned pending fulfilment of the requirement that she produce all information relating to her ability to pay maintenance and for her examination by the respondent to determine her income. HELD: The examination was completed and by agreement of counsel the questions to be resolved were whether the mother had produced all relevant financial information, and whether a trial should be directed as to the amount of maintenance payable by her. Counsel for Mr. Overs submitted that the financial records of the trucking corporation owned by the husband's wife should be disclosed as they were not kept in the respondent's home and did not have the filing information required for their examination by him. Counsel For Mr.O sought financial information relating the ranching operations where the Petersens resided and whether the petitioner should be required to produce her father's farming accounts. HOLD: The application for the calculation of the amountof child maintenance was dismissed with costs to the petitioner in the amount OF $500. Neither counsel for Mr Overs nor the petitioner could find anything to assist him in determining the amount payable by the petitioner. Neither the petitioner's father's business or residence would assist him because of the difficulty in canvassing the financial history of the corporation and the petitioner had no farm/cattle income or expense banking accounts of her own and offered nothing to substantiate her income from the farming and cattle operation with her other than her annual tax returns. Counseling fees were also ordered to the respondent."
e_2010skpc130.txt,"Defence sought an adjournment of a preliminary hearing to call a police accident reconstructionist as a witness. Prior to the commencement of the hearing, defence counsel was aware that the Crown did not intend to call this person as part of its case. One month prior to the preliminary hearing, defence counsel requested that the accident reconstructionist be made available as witness. The Crown advised defence that the officer was out of the country on peace keeping mission. The officer was expected back within months of the commencement of the preliminary hearing. HELD: The defence request for an adjournment was granted. The Court could not be satisfied that the officer was not a material witness to the preliminary inquiry. The Court was not satisfied that defence was guilty of neglect in failing to procure the officer's attendance when they had been advised by the Crown that he was out of the country. The length of the adjournment would not be lengthy.","The accused was charged with committing an offence under s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code and knowing or ought to have known that his operation of the motor vehicle caused an accident resulting in bodily harm to another person. The Crown had refused to call any of the witnesses it had called. The accused came before the Court for preliminary inquiry on July 26, 2010. After Crown called all of their witnesses, asked Defence Counsel if they had any witnesses to call on the preliminary inquiry and he advised that he wished to call Sergeant Barbar as a witness. Defence Counsel opposed the adjournment request. HELD: The Court was satisfied that the Defence was guilty of neglect in procuring the attendance of Sergeant Barbar.

e_2014skpc35.txt,"The Crown found the accused not guilty. With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address. The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary. Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice. Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present. All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel. Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence. There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed.","HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court found that the accused had not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that his registration was invalid and that he was prohibited from driving. The Certificate of Disqualification or Prohibition was admissible. The Crown did not provide prima facie proof of identity and there was no Charter violation asserted. The officer properly obtained a licence and issued an Appearance Notice. The accused entered a not guilty plea and was released on a Promise to Appear. The following day, the accused was arrested and read his rights to counsel. He was released onto an Appearance notice that forms part of the court record and was signed by the accused. The defence argued that an in-court identification was not necessary and there had not be any evidence that proper notice had been given. The court concluded that the identity of the accused has been established. The certificate is not admissible and the Crown has failed to establish that the person with whom the police officer dealt dealt with was the person who stood before the court."
e_1999skqb106.txt,"FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.","The plaintiffs sued the defendants based on a claim that they were negligent and reckless in providing helicopter transportation to and from the work site. The defendants admitted to requesting the service of Kyrgyzstan National Airline to transport the crew to and From the Crash. The weather forecast was wrong about the altitude of the lower edge of the clouds and the visibility and this made it difficult for the crew members to orient themselves visually. The plaintiff alleged that the airfare prices were inflated by the reason the helicopter had been ordered to be paid by the defendant and that the consultant had obtained insurance through KOC to cover the cost of providing the insurance and the associated associated costs. The consultant had received information that the helicopter was unsafe and he arranged for KOC and Cameco to arrange for the use of it. When the plaintiff and the defendant corporations made decisions that were not made by KOC, they were either negligent or ordered to pay premiums through KOS or arranged for the insurance companies to cover their costs. In the event that the insurance company was not aware of the insurance policy, the litigation would have resulted in a loss of profits for the defendant corporation and the plaintiff would have lost her income tax deduction. The defence claimed that the claimed privilege preventing it from ascertaining the names of potential witnesses was not relevant. The Court referred to the fact that the KOC statement of claim referenced Kyrgyzelstan as the originator of the helicopter transport and the date the helicopter became operational as opposed to the defendants' knowledge of the same. The KOC website was not accessible on the internet and there was no information available on the Internet about the status of the e-mail system. The website was inaccessible to the public. The plaintiffs sued for discovery. Finding that the website was unreadable and that there was a record of all memoranda generated by the employees for the purpose of compiling a report on the helicopter transportation and the crash was not an issue. Finding for the plaintiff that the web site was not properly identified was not a sufficient issue. The court found that the websites were not accessible to the general public and that a detailed examination of documents would be necessary to determine their relevance. Finding a finding that the internet connection was not inherently dangerous was not allowed and the questions should be answered. The Certificate of Disclosure was not found. The certificate of absence was not considered. The certificates were not issued to the plaintiff. The remaining certificates were issued to each individual corporation."

b_1999canlii12440.txt,"In the first application under the Family Maintenance Act the father sought to reduce child maintenance of $250 per child per month to an amount in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines; cancellation of arrears of $13,273.39; and increased access. In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck. HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.  2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears. Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to a support payable prior to 1997. The father's income was sufficient for him to pay child support for 1996 and 1997. Arrears for 1993 to 1995 inclusive were reduced as he was not able to pay according to the order at those times. Upon payment of $5,000 the balance of arrears accrued prior to December 31/98 would be extinguished. 3)The father was to pay child support of $325 per month for the two children. Garnishment of his wages by the Maintenance Enforcement Office were to be limited to $175 per month for arrears plus the current maintenance due. 4)The parties agreed the father should have access not less than one full weekend per month upon two weeks prior notice plus when he was available to attend at the city in a manner consistent with the children's best interests and their need to be available for school.","Two applications before the Court under the Family Maintenance Act s.10 seeking an order for the reverse of the child maintenance payable pursuant to the 1993 order by reducing the monthly maintenance from $250 to $250 and varying the maintenance payable thereunder from $350 to $500. The father also applied for a variation of the 1993 Order by reducing his monthly child support payments from $300 to $325. HELD: The father's annual income for the years 1996 to 1997 was sufficient to enable him to pay the child support under the 1993 orders but his income for those years 1996, 1997 and 1998 was insufficient to enable his to pay full monthly maintenance. With respect to the years 1993 to 1995, inclusive, the father was not in a position to pay half monthly maintenance but was in a better position to exercise access. The mother's application for a share of the arrears to be extinguished was unsuccessful. The Court was not prepared to hear her application and advised her to apply by notice motion with appropriate supporting affidavits. The total arrear for the children is $22,993. The parties agree that the father should have access to the children not less than one full weekend per month between 6:00 p.m. on Friday to 6:30 p. m. on Sunday upon two weeks prior notice together plus other periods of time when he is available to attend at Saskatoon for the purposes of exercising access in a manner consistent with the best interest of the children including their need to be available for school. HOLD: The Court found that the parties were not in an improper situation in allowing the father to access the children. The Father's access had not been a problem in the past. The Mother's Law principles of law governing child support for infant children are well-known and specifically provided in the Guidelines and the Act. Arrears in the father's favour were $13,472.39 and were extinguished unless otherwise ordered. The Maintenance Enforcement Officer for the Province of Saskatchewan was directed to limit garnishment of the father and to limit arrearing to $175 per month on account of the current maintenance due. The Family Maintenance Officer for Saskatchewan was not able to attend to the application because he was not physically able to access to his children."
d_2001nssc18.txt,"The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave. The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority. The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority. The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision. Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made.","The grievor was a hotel employee who had been employed for ten years as front desk manager for the Delta Sydney hotel. She had been in the front desk department for ten months and had recently commenced a part-time position. She suffered from a back problem and was unable to manage the workload adequately. She filed a grievance against the hotel and alleged that the reduction of her work hours based on departmental seniority constituted a violation of Article 9 of the collective agreement. She sought allotment of work hours and recovery of her loss of wages attributable to the reduction in her hours since Ms. MacMaster's maternity leave. The arbitrator referred to two provisions of the clause which he referred to, namely, that the arbitrator's interpretation of the reduction to be based on the departmental level and that of the grievor’s interpretation that the clause refers to reduction of workhour for employees with less departmental or departmental Seniority. The hotel argued that the wording of Article9:01 is wide enough to encompass the situation. It argued that this was not a lay-off situation and that the interpretation of Article911(at) was not patently unreasonable. It was simply an interpretation of another language which was clearly not in line with the terms of the Collective Agreement. The court granted the order of the arbitrators for judicial review and granted the stay of the appeal on the basis that the decision was patently irrational. The appeal was granted on the ground that the portions of the original decision which allowed the interpretation to be interpreted as being patently reasonable, but not pathetically unreasonable, and thus outside the realm of acceptable possibilities."
b_2014skca82.txt,"The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed. The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal. The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so. The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony. The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed. The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous. The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial. The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial. The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial. Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondent from a charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to s. 249(3) of the Criminal Code. The Crown appeals this acquittal. The respondent was tried on this charge before judge alone and was acquitted on October 10, 2013. The Court of Appeal would dismiss the appeal. In this view, the Crown has failed to overcome the heavy onus required to overturn appeals from acquittals under s. 676(1)(a) of The Code. HELD: The Crown argues that the trial judge did not consider that the appellant's speed was less than 100 km per hour. At issue is whether the trial trial judge erred by applying the incorrect mens rea and actus reus to the offence of dangerous drinking. The trial judge was not, in his view, mistaking the mens Rea of dangerous Driving. The court was not seeking to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's speed needed to be proved beyond areasonable doubt. The accused's argument that the Crown failed to consider that he was speeding in a construction zone was not supported by the facts. The appeal will be dismissed. The onus of proving speed beyond reasonable doubt is heavy one. The case law requires a clear and presentable reasonableness to apply the elements of dangerous drive. The only thing that could be said to be wrong was the trial's failure to properly process the evidence. The facts did not establish that the respondent's speed required to be proven beyond a reasonably reasonable doubt."
2001skqb148.txt,"FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs.","Three motions were brought under Queen's Bench Rule 173(a) and 188. The motions were based on Queen's Buhari Rules. The first motion was brought by a Saskatchewan Police officer who had commenced a action within the limitation period as provided in s. 2(1)(a) of the Public Officers' Protection Act. He was arrested, detained in custody for 4 days, and suspended from his employment as a police officer for 5 months. He commenced this action fifteen months after the stay of proceedings was entered. The second motion was filed by a person claiming breach of contract and professional negligence. The limitation period had only run 1 year following the entry of the stay. The defendant brought this action pursuant to Queen's Rule 173 (e) and (f) of that Act. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs under double Column V, the claim against the defendant was set aside and the judgment against the plaintiff was set-off against the defendants. 1)The limitation period did not commence to run until after the expiration of the 1 year limitation period. 2)The Court of Appeal reviewed the various decisions and decisions on file and found that the limitation periods were not limited to events prior to the entering of a stay of Proceedings. It was not necessary to determine whether the action was statute-barred or whether the limitation was extended. 3)The Act does not alter the substantive rights of the to-doctors in the Public Officer Protection Act, save for the limitation of time periods. Limitation of actions is a procedural instrument which allows the Crown to re-commence criminal prosecution during a period of 1 year from the date the entry date of the action. 4)The remaining substantive issues were determined by the Court of Review. Whether the action is barred by a statutory limitation period, whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc, whether assertions of subsequent conduct by at least some of the defendants were made within the meaning of the Act, whether the claim had a prima facie case and whether the plaintiff had given adequate opportunity to tendering amends prior to tendered. 5)The limitations imposed by the Act do not impede the right of the officer to commence a new action. 6)Limitation of Actions are substantive in character and there still is a factual component and absent an agreed statement of facts there should not be an order granted under Rule 188."
b_1996canlii5058.txt,"The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act. The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David. First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity. When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate. Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application. The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.  1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable. 3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.  4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable. The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due. Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas. The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment. Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due. 5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose. It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances. DISSENT: The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date. The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation. There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.","Whether a money owed under a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) is debt 'accruing due' under s. 5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act can be determined by reference only to garnishability of promissory notes not yet due. In this case, the debt owing under a pledged investment certificate, (GCC) was a debt which was a conditional one and made so by reason of the possibility of assignment.HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)Whether a debt owing in a GIC is debt (accruitive) under s.(1) is a conditional debt. 2)Graft is a word which can only be understood as meaning conditional. 3)Growth is not dependent upon the completion of a service or the payment of a debt. 4)The garnishment of the debt is a condition which arises naturally from a sale of a particular instrument. 5)Garnishment is not a branch of the common law of England which no longer applies. 6)The case law of garnishment is different from that of the garnishment or attachment of other debts. 7)The common law is based upon the principles of the assignability of note and is therefore not the complete answer to the issue at hand."
e_2007skqb174.txt,"The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","HELD: The court ordered joint custody of the child with the father. The court found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances with regard to the mother's decision to move with the child to Yukon. The evidence from the trial confirmed each of the seven points outlined in the original custody judgment. The mother had been vociferous in opposition to the father's application for custody and had opposed the father’s application to be allowed to change the child’S primary residence to Whitehorse. The father argued that given the mother’ sagging performance in custody and the father having removed the child from Saskatchewan, it was in the childs best interests for the father to move to YukON. The child was currently enrolled in kindergarten and daycare close to her father”s apartment in Saskatoon. HELD: 1) The evidence at trial confirmed all of the points outlined by the father in support of the proposed relocation. The Court reviewed each of them. 2) The court reviewed each one of the 7 factors listed in the Original Custody judgment. 3) The Court was satisfied that there was a material shift in the circumstance which existed at the time the custodial parent”d decided to move. The decision was based on the evidence of the custodian parent. The respondent was granted sole custody of their child. The custody issue was whether the father should move with it to Yukono. The fact that the child had not seen the mother for the past few months and was not able to access her father at the trial did not change the court’d view of the relationship between the child and the custodious parent."
9_2004skqb324.txt,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","Walgreens applied for an order quashing two orders of the Board made pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing. The orders required Wal-Mart to discover and produce documents, including those referred to in a subpoena duces tecum. The order also required that the Board produce documents that are irrelevant to the issues before the Board. The Board conceded that two exceptions to the rule that error of law must appear on the face of the record were that it had not addressed the relevancy requirement in its decision to authorize the plaintiff to discover documents or to conduct an examination for discovery by means of subpoena duce tecum or a series of production orders. Wal- Mart Canada took no issue with the decision to not only order the production of documents but also with the discovery and production of additional documents. HELD: A review of the transcript is essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and to consider each aspect of the breach of Charter allegations. The following are the issues: 1) the Board's decision to order the discovery of documents referred to by the plaintiff and in the subpoena duced tecum; the Board’s decision to allow the plaintiff in its application to discover the documents referred by the defendant in the subpoenas; and 2) the necessity of reviewing the transcript to consider the issues relevant to the application. The Court found that the decision of the board was premature and premature in light of the extensive documentation produced by the UFCW’S counsel. The applications were brought by the parties and the court found that it did not have the authority to determine the extent of the damage to the Board or to the integrity of the Trade Union Act. The court ordered that the documents be produced in accordance with the prescribed format and format for each issue. The plaintiff was entitled to rely on the standard of review set out in the TradeUnion Act."
b_1996canlii5628.txt,"The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years. As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation. The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages. He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages. Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months. Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified. Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears. Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had.","The sales agent for Allstate was terminated as a result of a two-year, seven month period in arrears notice policyholders. The termination of the sales agent's contract provided for monthly compensation based on the net written premium on new policies written during the previous month and renewal compensation calculated in respect to renewals based on average renewals. The compensation was also included in the amount of support for the terminated employee for two years. The terminated agent attempted to secure alternative employment but failed, as he was not paid any commission. The court awarded 20 months salary as damages for arrear. The defendant did not seek credit for the rest of the period of delay. The plaintiff suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and lost his job and his income. He sought and was refused employment. He appealed his arreary award. Dismissing the appeal, that the defendant's claim for the unpaid wages was not unreasonable and did not constitute a failure by the plaintiff to mitigate his damages. The claim for lost wages was also dismissed. The trial judge found that the defendants had not made reasonable efforts to secure alternate employment. The case law clearly predates the termination of this employee."
4_2010nssc85.txt,"The parties were separated and had difficulty communicating. They were together for eight years, and had two children (ages six and three). The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50). She alleged the husband was abusive. The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children. Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times). The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded. If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that. Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan. Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation. A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance. Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.","The parties were married for approximately thirty years. They had two children, ages 18 and 18. The wife was a primary caretaker of the children and requested that the children be placed in the husband's sole care and custody. The children were to be in the wife's care every second weekend. The husband requested that all of the parenting responsibilities be fulfilled. The evidence suggested that the wife was very stressed when parenting alone but had not been able to exercise the parenting role effectively. The parties did not have the luxury of hindsight, and the court was satisfied there were opportunities for the wife to develop some insight and sensitivity about the husband’s parenting role."

The hotel was convicted on one charge and the remaining charges were held in abeyance pending its appeal. The hotel sought an order staying the hearing scheduled by the Commission to review a decision of the Authority suspending the applicant's tavern permit for three days, pending disposal of the criminal charges. Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The second ground raised a substantive issue and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth. There was nothing inconsistent with the Commission considering a form of disqualification of the applicant's license or permit, while the state exercises its criminal law power with respect to the same set of facts. 2)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence.

The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing would not result in any new facts that were not already known to it. 2)The Commission was not relying on conviction, and the Commission was treating the allegations as opposed to a procedural one.

e_2008skqb84.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred. There was no unfairness in the trial process. The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant. He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer. 2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant. The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case. He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen. The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v. Romanowicz (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.).","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court found that the appellant had not suffered a miscarriage of justice as a result of the ineffective counsel of the complainant. The matter was remitted to a jury to determine whether the appellant should have taken the position that his non-lawyer was ineffective and thus, should have been allowed to proceed. The fresh evidence was not directed to a factual issue decided by the trial judge but rather to obtaining an original remedy from this Court on the basis that the agent's ineffectual assistance resulted in a miscarriageof justice. The process in this case was developed so that an accused who is represented by a non- lawyer agent at trial is not exposed to the same scrutiny and scrutiny as those who are trained in the law. The law in this area is well established and there is little reason to embark on further analysis of overturning the conviction on the grounds of finding fact."

e_2006nssc364.txt,"The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter. The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages. The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed. The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle.","The plaintiff, who was pursuing a shoplifter, was hit by a van that had been used as the getaway vehicle in the shoplifting heist. The plaintiff, now 30, sought to register ownership of another vehicle with the Registry of Motor Vehicles. His lawyer prepared a Statutory Declaration for the plaintiff which he swore to secrecy and gave to his client. The client, who had obtained a Section 133(14) of the Insurance Act from the plaintiff, admitted that he had no idea who the driver was, but that he assumed that he was the owner of the vehicle. The Court distinguished between the plaintiff's version of events and that of the driver of the van that struck the plaintiff and his own version of the events. The facts were very much in dispute and credibility findings were required. The only clear evidence before the Court on the identity of the defendant was his own. The court found that the plaintiff had no documentation whatsoever in proof of the sale of the Van to the plaintiff. Hence, he retained lawyer to prepare a Statute Declaration for him to use as a witness. The Statutory Statement was never produced nor was it given to the client. It was a copy of the original Statutory declaration which was never issued to the court. The Certificate was never obtained nor was there any evidence offered by the client as to its ownership. The defendant's version that he sold the van to the victim was completely unreliable. The fact that the documents were never produced was a significant issue in the trial. The inconsistencies in the defendant's evidence were significant."

At the onset of her trial, the accused took the position that her s. 8, s. 9 and s. 10 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all the evidence obtained after the stop should be excluded. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached. 1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest. 2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there. 3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.","The accused was charged with possession and use of a weapon for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession and sale of marijuana in the presence of a person with a valid driving licence contrary to S. 267(a) of The Highway Traffic Safety Act and with the commission of a sexual offence contrary to ss. 249(1)(a) and C.P.I.A. The accused's s. 8, 9 and 10 Charter rights were infringed. All evidence obtained after the initial stop should be excluded pursuant to s24(2). HELD: The evidence was excluded. Even the s. 7 doctrine of the Charter was not applicable. The evidence did not establish any symptoms of impairment. The Court found that the presence or absence of marijuana during the initial search was not sufficient grounds to exclude it from its evidence. The strong odour of marijuana emanating from the interior of the vehicle gave the Court a reasonable suspicion that it was marijuana. The presence of any other evidence of impairment would not disqualify the accused from possessing or consuming marijuana."
4_1996canlii6648.txt,The applicant sought to have the law firm barred from acting for the plaintiff because a member of that firm had been active in representing the defendant prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers following a change in government. This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors. The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause. 1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff. This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.  2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern. 4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme. It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists. Also such policies may well have changed since 1992.,"The applicant sought to have the solicitor barred from acting for the plaintiff by reason of her affiliation with a previous firm which had been active in representing the defendant Crown corporation prior to 1991 when the defendant changed solicitors. This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the contractual issues giving rise to the cause of action were ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors (see: 1993). In a similar application, sodoing I was being consistent with a prior ruling involving a asimilar attempt to displace the applicant's present solicitors from certain litigation then existing following the 1982 change of government. It was argued the applicant had as yet no such strategy exists. The only identifiable strategy adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications, including this one, to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The applicant was being followed by a prior case involving a similar attempt to dislodge the present solicitor from certain specified litigation then existed. 2)The solicitor should have known his way around the rules and regulations applicable to all matters of this kind. 3)The situation in this case was exactly the same as decided in 1993 in a similar action respecting another solicitor. The solicitor had been a member of that firm prior to the change in solicitors but had been involved in representing Crown corporation clients prior to1991 when the defendants changed solicitor. This was a case where all knowledge of one is attributed to the other. 4)The confidential nature of the applicant solicitor's information and its strategy in relation to the denial of claims was a very different one from that which could not be deduced from the pleadings and examinations for discovery by any competent lawyer. It has been argued by the plaintiff that the situation in the case is exactly the Same as decided because Mr. Willner, the subject in the previous application, and Ms. Schirr, the present target, were partners or associates at all material times and if ruled in favour of the plaintiff then must do so now as all knowledge is for these purposes attributed to one of the other defendants. 5)The use of a confidential nature in this application was not a consideration in the granting of the injunction but rather a pre-judgment interest. 6)The information itself cannot be disclosed. It is reasonable to insist that the nature of information be disclosed by reference to strategy counsel.

b_2008skpc104.txt,"The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act. There was a complaint to police concerning the accused. He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment. He smelled of alcohol. He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police. Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol. He was causing a disturbance to others. Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place. No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused. The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication. The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go. In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest. There was no such person in this case. The arrest was, on these facts, lawful.","The accused is charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argues that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and that the accused was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position is that in these circumstances the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to the Summary Offences Procedure Act. The arrest was lawful. The Court makes the following finding of the facts: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonably doubt that The Police were engaged IN the lawful Execution of their duties when the the accused resist their efforts in the Summary offences Procedure act. Hearsay, s. 52(2) of The Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act, states that no person shall be in an intoxicated condition in a public place or permitted premises. Pursuant to s.(1) of this Act, the peace officer may arrest without warrant any person whom he finds committing an offence under the Act. Under s.52(2), the peace officers were engaging in the'lawful execution' of theirduty when the appellant resisted their attempts to arrest them pursuant to The Alcohol & Gaming Regulation act. Section 129 of the Alcohol andGaming Regulation Act states that 'no person shall... be in a... intoxicated condition' in a permitted premises or permitted grounds. Pursue to s 143 of the same Act, a peace officer can arrest without a warrant any people whom he, himself, finds committing offence underthe Act."
2_2011nsca89.txt,"The defendant, who was in a very small apartment with two other individuals, got up from the couch and proceeded through a doorway behind the complainant, purportedly to use the bathroom. A few minutes later, the complainant found something wrapped around his neck and he was choked until he passed out. When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him. She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back. The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat. Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door. Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay. When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked. She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. Appeal dismissed;  it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility. Although he did not specifically refer to the principles in R. v. Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence. The complainant never wavered in his evidence that the other individual had never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat, which was supported by the other individual's testimony.","The appellant appealed her conviction for robbery alleging error by the trial judge in his assessment of credibility. The appellant had been on parole and had visited the victim often. At some point shortly after their arrival, the appellant got up and proceeded through the doorway behind the victim to use the washroom. A few moments later the victim was lying on the floor and the appellant was crouching over him. He felt his wallet under his back. The accused said nothing and left. The victim called the police, who quickly apprehended the appellant after discovering her hiding under a bed at the appellant's residence. The police were unable to recover any of the money that the victim had lost. The judge found that the appellant sat on the couch across from the kitchen table where the victim seated and that at some point after they arrived, the accused got up to use his washroom, when he felt something wrap around his throat. He was choked until he passed out. The Crown and defence both argued that the offence was a credibility contest and that the trial court did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and the defence positions without then going on to assess the whole of the evidence to establish proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Appeal dismissed; the trial judges did not stray into the traps of simply comparison the Crown & defence evidence without then realizing that the ultimate issue was not credibility but a reasonable and probable doubt."
b_2012nssc225.txt,",  motion denied. The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions. The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation. The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation. The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions. The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court. The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants. The court dismissed the motion.","The plaintiffs brought a motion to consolidate their claim against the defendants with three other named actions. All four defendants were originally seeking consolidation of an action. Allowing the motion, that (1) there was a common law principle behind the pleadings and submissions of the defendants, and (2) that there was no evidence to establish that the series of transactions were all part of the same transaction as contemplated by the Rule. (3) that the defendants' proposed remedies were not mandatory in order to successfully argue for consolidation that 'a decision in one case would dispose of the essential cause of action in the other case'.  4) The defendants' request to have the matters heard together was dismissed. The Court reviewed the rules and case authorities available and found that, in addition to the common law principles advanced in Rule 37.02 and 37.03, there was also a balance of factors. The court could not find that the proposed remedies met the necessary balance of needs."

Blood was drawn from the complainant and her infant daughter, as well as the accused pursuant to a warrant. The accused challenged the validity of the warrant. He contended that a warrant could only be issued for comparison purposes with a bodily substance found in circumstances described in section 487.05(b) of the Criminal Code, which, he alleged, did not include a bodily substance created by virtue of the conception of a child. Admitting the evidence, that the DNA of a baby born as a result of a sexual assault is a bodily substance for the purposes of section 487.05(b) despite the fact that the child did not exist at the time of the offence.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and related sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused sought to exclude DNA evidence on the basis that his s. and s. Charter rights were breached. He changed his plea to guilty. Dismissing the application, that the evidence was admissible for the purpose of trial. The Court reviewed the various requirements for assessing credibility and found that the accused had met the requirements for interpreting credibility and the Court found that s. 487.05 of the Code is a sufficient criterion to permit a reasonably grounded belief that the infant, as described in s. 367.06 (b) of the code, was born full term. The blood sample taken from the accused was given to the police as a warning statement. The police did not consult lawyer and the consent of the accused clearly indicated that the consent would be given willingly. The Statement was Transcripted and subsequently obtained by the Crown. The Crown did not introduce into evidence the results of Forensic DNA analysis or the procedure to obtain a sample of the infant. The voir dire was held that the officer had failed to show any violation of his Charter rights. DNA evidence ruled admissible."

The judge left it open to the Superintendent to proceed with his applications when the McMaster action was finished and that her decision respecting his powers was open to review upon further evidence being adduced.","The Superintendent of Pensions seeks leave to appeal an order staying six separate proceedings brought by him in purported exercise of powers conferred on him by s.8 of The Pension Benefits Act, 1992, S.S.1992, c.P-6.001 and Regulations made thereunder. The stay was granted upon the applications of the respondent corporations and was to remain in effect until an action against them by one Faye McMaster, not a party to these proceedings, was settled or otherwise completed. The subject matter of the action and the Superintendent's applications was the same, namely certain monies the respondent's husband had paid into a pension plan and in which she had an interest by reason of judicial division of matrimonial property.

The Court finds that there is no evidence of fraud or any concealment of facts that would allow the plaintiff's claim to succeed. There is further evidence of unjust enrichment, as the plaintiff signed an agreement with the defendant to supply and install business equipment for the plaintiff. The equipment was discovered prior to October 2007 and therefore the plaintiff had until October 2009 to commence his action. The defendant has not commenced his action until January 2010.

d_2007skqb406.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs are former students of a school at Ile a La Crosse, Saskatchewan. They commenced this proposed class action against the Attorney General of Canada (the Government) in December 2005. In January 2007 the plaintiffs' counsel filed an amended statement of claim which added the Government of Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan) as a second defendant. Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim. The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents. HELD: 1) This application is based on the proposition that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applies to the plaintiffs' amended claim. However, s. 20 does not apply because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant. Section 19 of The Limitations Act applies to the original and the amended claims. The application is dismissed. 2) Accepting the pleadings as true, a number of the plaintiffs' claims are prima facie statute-barred. The plaintiff may choose to apply for orders determining that no time limitation period applies or allowing the claims to be brought. Alternatively, the defendants may apply for orders determining that some or all of the claims are statute-barred. In either case, the applications must satisfy the applicable legislation and the Rules of Court.",HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the amendments to the statement of claim were permitted by Queen's Bench Rule 66 and that leave of the court under s. 20 of The Limitations Act was not required. The amendments were also dismissed. A number of issues were identified as being prima facie statute-barred. The claim was not subject to a time limitation period as s. 19 of TheLimitations Act applied.

The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga. The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands. The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages. In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act. HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1. As the Provincial Court judge's conclusion was correct, the Court held that the convictions must stand and did not interfere with the fines and surcharges imposed upon the respondents.","The petitioner manufactures log-home packages near Weyakwin, under the direction of Garry Varga, the sole director of the company. As a result of what the manufacture of these packages entails, both the company and Varga were convicted in Provincial Court of operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s.18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act, S.S. 1996. In consequence, each was fined and ordered to pay a surcharge. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the convictions restored.

The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that questions of evidence were of sufficient importance to grant leave. The applicant’s third ground was that the Chambers judge failed to take into account the interests of the public, particularly, the need to deter the public and the need to remove profit from crime to compensate victims. The Court of Appeal did not grant leave on the third ground. The Chambers judge reviewed the relevant case law and did not fail to take those items into account. The last ground of appeal was the fact that the vehicle had already been held for 90 days. The Court of Appeal said that this ground did raise some interest but they were not convinced that this was the case to grant the leave to appeal.","The Director of the Director's application for the forfeiture of a vehicle registered to the respondent seeks leave to appeal a Queen's Bench Chambers decision which denied his application for a forfeiture of vehicle registeredto the respondent. The Director's decision was brought pursuant to s. of the Act on the grounds that the vehicle had been used in criminal activity. The applicant and the respondent are common-law spouses. The director purchased the vehicle in 2010 with money received from her father's estate. Beginning in January 2013, she and the applicant used it to haul items on a on-call basis. The respondent entered the compound through a hole in the fence and returned with two pails of copper wire. The accused pled guilty to three counts of theft under $5,000 and one count of break and enter. Both charges were ultimately withdrawn. The appellant and the vehicle were found in the vehicle for 90 days. The Chambers judge found that the applicant had made four errors in coming to his decision, namely considering certain information about the circumstances of the applicant and whether the applicant, Ms. Brinkman and Mr. Tropeau, had been in the Vehicle for nine months because it had been held by the Director pending the outcome of his application.

SGI denied his claim for income replacement benefits as a non-earner under s.117(1) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. In issue was whether the accident caused the disc herniation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The plaintiff had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities. Two family physicians supported his contention but the medical director of rehabilitation services for SGI and the orthopaedic surgeon who treated the applicant were both of the opinion the herniation was not caused by the accident.,"The applicant, who had been working part-time as a back specialist, applied for income replacement benefits contending that the accident had not caused the disc herniation. The respondent, Saskatchewan Government Insurance, denied the claim. The applicant appealed to the Court pursuant to s. 197. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no doubt that for a period of time after the disc hersiation, the non-earner was unable to hold the employment he could have held at the time of the accident and would be entitled to an income replacement benefit if the herniated was not caused by the accident. 2)Accident is defined in s.100(1)(a) as any event in which bodily injury is caused by an automobile. The onus is on the applicant to establish his claim to the benefits on a balance of probabilities. He failed to establish causation on a balanced of probabilities on a review of all of the evidence."

Although the accused was lawfully stopped, the roadside demand was valid and the accused declined to exercise his right to counsel on two occasions following his arrest, the observation period at the detachment was not conducted properly.

As the observation period comprised part and parcel of a breath test, the breathalyzer test was not properly administered and the Crown could not rely on the accuracy of the readings.","HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2, over.08.

b_1997canlii11437.txt,"A month following the birth of the plaintiff's only child by caesarian section, she underwent a hysterectomy on an emergency basis. She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her. The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics. 2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part. The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix. Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted. The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage. ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4: The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes.","The plaintiff, who was the mother of the plaintiff's child, was admitted to the Victoria Union Hospital on an emergency basis as a result of profuse vaginalbleeding. The doctors who had performed the caesarian section did not initially believe that the bleeding was from the cervix, but later concluded that it was from a vaginal wound. The female plaintiff suffered a sudden and massive hemorrhage. She was treated by emergency medical services and then transferred to intensive care. The defendant, who had operated on the plaintiff since 1992, was charged with the first and foremost of the allegations of negligence. The second plaintiff, in his evidence of the necessity to have the surgical procedure performed, argued that the surgical intervention was the only reasonable explanation. The third plaintiff, having been advised that the procedure was likely the only option, argued the Court would err in not requiring the surgical expert to testify, but rather requiring him to be present and available to testify. HELD: 1)The surgical intervention did not relieve the plaintiff of her obligation to provide accurate and complete medical care to the child. 2)The oral evidence of surgical intervention, especially after the discovery of the necrotic cervix (which had broken away during the examination and was visible to the naked eye), was not considered credible evidence. 3)The medical evidence did not support the plaintiff’s contention that the hemorrhage in this case was caused by retained products of conception. The oral evidence was not credible. The surgical intervention by the physician was not the only viable explanation for the continued bleeding. The evidence was conclusive that the surgery was not performed by the doctor. 4)The final plaintiff was the plaintiff. The Court held that the medical evidence showed that the likely cause of the bleeding, on and after September 29, 1997, was the vaginal wound, not the surgical wound. 5)The Court found that the oral evidence did support the conclusion that the vaginal bleeding was the cause of this hemorrhage, but that the evidence did point to the greater probability that the hysterectomy was performed. 6)The Judge found that there was no evidence to support the conclusions of the Court in Ares v. Venner, which held that if the surgical experts had been consulted, they would have drawn the conclusion which was the greater likely explanation."
d_2002skpc138.txt,"The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing. HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples. The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed. The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer. Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition. He should not drink and drive.",The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand made to him by a Peace Officer. The accused was on duty at 2:00 a.m. when the Citizens on Patrol Program personnel were on the lookout for a vehicle that was driving erratically. The police observed the accused use the window to look at the vehicle. He opened the door and asked if he had anything to drink. The officer told him that he had not. The breath sample was not produced. The male accused did not have a breathalyzer. The female officer told the accused that he blew his mouth long and hard and then blew his nose. The effect of this was to make it impossible for the accused to provide a sample. The Court found that the male accused was not diligent in attempting to obtain counsel and that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide one. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not blowing properly into the mouthpiece.

The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties. The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division. The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens. The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted. The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production. If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys. A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing. The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act. The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times. On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a). 5)The second and third tests were not met. The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value. It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do. If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent. There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan. The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued.",FIAT The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from certain oil production properties and a further order preservingand detaining all future proceeds of oil recovered on certain lands upon which the respondents had registered builders' liens.  1)The respondents appeared on the application and gave evidence that they would suffer irreparable harm if the order was not granted as they claimed that the proceeds from the actions would be held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court and a separate order preserving & detaining the proceeds. 2)The applicants failed to meet the first test by submitting affidavits showing that they intended to pay full compensation but that the application was premature. 3)The applicant must prove a very strong probability that grave damage will accrue to the respondents. 4)The Court must be careful to see that the defendant knows exactly what he has to do and this means not as a matter of law but as a fact.

As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours. When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off. The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house.

The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving. The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes. The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45. An alcohol expert and the accused testified. The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to. The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007. HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence. The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis. The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions. The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping. There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face. The accused was found guilty of the evading charge.","The accused was found not guilty on a charge of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol concentration over 80 mg% while his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit. The accused offered a 'last drink' defence, arguing that alcohol he drank just before driving was not yet in his blood stream when he was stopped by the officer, but was at the time his breath tests were taken at the detachment. HELD: The accused was not found guilty of driving with with a Blood Alcohol concentration over.08. The evidence of the RCMP officer who observed the accused driving was insufficient to prove that the accused was impaired. The Court was satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused's alcohol consumption, that his BAC at the start of driving was different than what it was told by the accused and that his belief that he would be 'home free' if he reached his driveway was clearly a mistake of law because what the accused gave to the officer was not a reasonable excuse for not stopping. The defence argued that the Court had no doubt that the officer had a reasonable reason for not pulling over the accused. The court was not satisfied that there was a credible reason for the accused not stopping as he was concerned about losing his licence and having his vehicle seized. The Crown appealed the decision of the Court of Appeal which held that the Crown had not proven that the second drink defence was reasonable. The appeal court rejected the accused’s contention that he was not trying to evade the police officer and accepted the evidence of Cst. Cobbledick."
2_2011nssc500.txt,"The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction. After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building. Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand. The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged. A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket. Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level. The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall. Accused found guilty on both counts; the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation. Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.","The accused was charged with two counts under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The Court found that the accused had stashed the drugs in a rock wall near the transaction site and that witnesses had noted that there was a conversation between the accused and the buyer of the drugs. The accused claimed that the voices in the bushes were not audible, but he stated that they were. The Crown alleged that the transactions were held in an observation post located less than 130 feet from the incident and from a position of some elevation. The police testified that they had observed the transaction from an observation position less than a mile from the location. The evidence of the police officer who was qualified as an expert on the use of binoculars to view the transaction was also considered credible. The court found that both the accused's descriptions of the buyer and the transaction were consistent with drug trafficking practices and not consistent with any other possible explanations. The trial judge found that there were two areas of the street where the transaction took place that were difficult to observe from a distance, but the presence of trees and bushes made it clear that the transaction had taken place. The presence of a large amount of smoke in the area made it impossible to observe the transaction. The encounters between the buyer/seller and the accused were consistent and not inconsistent with other possible explanation's. The encounter between the driver and the pedestrian was not plain and obvious from the vantage point of the vehicle. The vehicle was not visible from the street. The officer testified that he was not in possession of the drug when arrested but moments after being observed taking something out of the pink baggy and handing it to the buyer, who then left the alley, he went around the back of 2388 and his silhouette could be seen by Constable Marriott a few feet behind the building in the immediate area where the drugs were stashed in the wall. The appellant was the constant observer with binocular vision and could not easily be seen one foot off the ground pushed into the rock wall just inside the corner of the building. The complainant was the only person able to observe what he saw unfold from the observation post. The rest of the evidence was insufficient to conclude that the appellant stashed these drugs in the rock-wall. The crown could have proceeded to the purchase of more drugs from another location, but chose not to do so. The issue of the appellant's evidence respecting the cutting substances in the baggy was also insufficient to decide whether the appellant was able to make full answer and defence. The"
5_2013skqb237.txt,"The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety. There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop. The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device. The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer. At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood. A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings. A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them. The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused. The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook. The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one. The accused did not recall this waiver. The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty. The accused's readings were .11 and .04. The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results. HELD: The appeal was not successful. Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b). The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure. The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned. The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective. The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached. The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The accused had consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and he was found not guilty of both charges. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The trial judge addressed the factors and correctly applied the test. As there was no error, the trial judge did not delay the issue. 2) The Court took comfort in the fact that patterns emerge with respect to particular types of evidence and that a trial judge can often be of assistance to the Crown in finding a waiver of a Charter right."
9_2009skqb313.txt,"The appellant appeals a demolition order pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act issued against his property. Issues on appeal was whether the board erred by considering material which had not been before city council, whether the board committed a jurisdictional error by failing to disclose evidence to the appellant prior to considering the appeal, and whether the board was biased against the appellant. HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds. The board's order is confirmed. Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of 6 months from the date of this court order. The applicant is granted a 6 month period to remedy the problems identified. 1) The board complied with the directions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure had been made to the appellant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. The board has ensured that the appellant knew the case he had to meet. No error of law has been committed. 2) The appellant had all the information considered by the board disclosed to him. 3) There is no evidence of bias. Oppositely, the evidence supports the board's conclusion that the situation in the building constituted a nuisance related to the activities around the building, including the safety of the residents and surrounding neighbours. There is no evidence of bias against the appellant personally.","The registered owner of the property appealed a quasi-judicial board decision and quasi-legal board order confirming his demolition bid. The board found the City was unreasonable in denying an adjournment to allow the respondent to prepare his appeal. The respondent sought to have the appeal heard by the Queen's Bench on the basis of the Board's preliminary decision which confirmed the demolition order. The Chambers judge failed to consider the importance of the failure of the City to supply a copy of the report which had fairly represented the discussions in prior meetings. The appellant alleged that the board allowed criminal activity to escalate so that the City would have reason to grant the demolitionorder. The Board determined the order to vacate and to demolish was appropriate and continues to be appropriate. The petitioner retained the City for an appeal to the Court of Queen's Cross in accordance with s. 329(4) of The Cities Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The appeal must be dismissed on all grounds. The order is confirmed. The court found that the Board had not properly verified the plaintiff's allegations regarding the use and activities of the building, the history of non-compliance, the intolerable sub-standard living conditions endured by the tenants and the absence of a pro-active approach by the board to responsibly manage the building had lent themselves to the nuisance complained of. The Court of Appeal directed the respondent be given a period of 6 months from the date of the decision to bring forth his written proposal. The request for an extension of the suspension of enforcement was granted. The Order to Vacate and Demolish was hereby confirmed."
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","The Director applied for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 of property to the Crown in Saskatchewan. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from the William Ross Butler in 2008. Since the plaintiff filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order pursuant to Part II.1. HELD: The application was granted. The Director’s evidence was not affected by the legislation. The legislation was not made expressly retroactive. The starting point for the commencement of the forfeiture proceedings was not the date of seizure as contended by the plaintiff but the date upon which the director became satisfied the property was being used for unlawful activity. The Court reviewed the history of the legislation and found that the current legislative mandate reflected in the 2009 Act is prospective in operational effect and not retroactive; the Court found that s. 35.1 of the 2009 legislation was applicable. The Act did not change the state of the law or the defendant’ s. 5 rights from what it was before the new law came into force."
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT. The father of one child applied to reduce his child support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under the previous order. The mother's application was adjourned sine die with direction to return the matter to court once the grievance filed by the father concerning his termination from Ipsco was determined by an arbitrator. HELD: 1) The father's application to vary was commenced in June 2002. He had made this application after experiencing a substantial decrease in his income when he was fired by his long-term employer, Ipsco. 2) The mother was highly critical of the father's decision to only work 3 months of the year and to only have it for support of his child. 3) The applicant's choice to work a minimum amount each year and/or return to school was not a reasonable decision when he had a continuing obligation to provide support for his child, Stephanie.  4) The primary questions to be answered were whether the father was underemployed and if so, if so whether income should be imputed. The applicant had not provided appropriate financial disclosure.  5) The evidence showed he was undployed. He was undependant. The court ordered costs as against the applicant for the additional legal expenses associated with having to submit motions to the Court in order to force the father to disclose financial information.  6) The application was directed to the mother. The primary question was whether the mother should pay retroactive child support or costs.  7) The family had grave concerns about the substantial delays in this proceeding. They had grave questions respecting the substantial delay in this matter."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","This appeal was from an order of Barclay J. which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the LabourRB, and even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. The issue is whether s. 5.3 of The Trade Union Act, R.S.S.(1978, c. T-17, authorizes the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs in the usual way. The chambers judge arrived at a correct conclusion. Section 5.2 both confers and limits the jurisdiction of the Boardto make interim orders. The question decided by the Board, that it had power to makes the order, was clearly a jurisdictional question. The Board recognized it to be jurisdictional and treated it. Accordingly, the standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. The board's jurisdiction is limited by the existence of an application or complaint before an arbitration Board, and its power to grant interim orders upon the power of the same Board to do final order."

HELD: 1)The wife was entitled to the following set-off: $800 to be included in her share of the matrimonial property division; 2)The respondent's claim for set-offs was allowed since he did not take up farming and his subsequent decision to assign into bankruptcy makes the calculation of what each hopes to recover from the marriage assets problematic at best.

SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply. Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT.

Moreover, it is an Act of such commonplace application as to strongly suggest notice might be given via registered mail, applying as it does to almost everyone in every corner of the rural areas of the Province, and falling as it did to be applied by local people with no special training, except for the administrators. 2)The board of Revision was to determine the appeal by August 1st, the deadline for which the notice of appeals is to be received. 3)The respondent exercised its right of appealed properly, whether or effectively, requiring the board to entertain the appeal. 4)The appeal from a decision of a Committee will continue and there is an order directed the board's to hear the appeal within 20 days of its mailing. 5)The delay in the appeal process is minor. 6)The notice of the appeal could only be given if posted early enough to be heard by the administrator before the 20 day period expires. In this case, nothing turned on the fact the notice did not arrive a day or two earlier, for the administrator and the board were still able to act upon it in accordance with the statute. 6. The word give is importing the necessity of receipt. This amounts to substantial compliance of near perfect sort, having respect for the purpose of the subsection and the objectives of its terms. This amount to substantial comply of near-perfect sort, which amounts to a substantial compliance, having to say in compliance with the terms of the section, and in sufficient compliance therewith to render the notice to appeal effective and empower the board with the hearing and determination of the appeals."
3_2002skca102.txt,"The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure. In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible. She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself.","The accused was charged with impaired driving, driving with a blood-alcohol level exceeding.08 and dangerous driving. The Crown filed an affidavit showing disclosure had been made. The respondent applied to the Queen's Bench for an order of prohibition. The order was granted on the reasoning that a trial judge should not be permitted to refuse to hear argument on the grounds that the Crown had not called a witness to testify. The defence argued that the trial had not commenced as no evidence had been called and therefore it could not be said the criminal record was put into evidence at trial. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the matter was remitted to Provincial Court for trial. The Queen's B Bench judge was granted his discretionary discretion to dismiss the application. 1)The appeal was denied. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court, whether composed of judge and jury or jury alone, does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. Although it is the presiding judge to ensure a fair hearing, there is no law which guarantees that inadvertent, inadmissible evidence will not be introduced. Even though the trial judge had not read the record, she was aware of its existence and that the record was something she could put out of her mind as she put out her mindas she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible. 2)The appellant was correct to dismiss her application for a stay of proceedings. The appeal must be allowed. There was no law that guarantees that unintentional, in admissible evidence won't be introduced into the trial. If an error of that nature should occur, the error should be ignored, or, if it is deemed too significant to be ignored by the judge, a mistrial declared. The accused's rights as guaranteed by the Charter are not violated when the inadvertent error occurs. 3)The appeals were allowed, the order for prohibition was quashed and the subject matter remitted back to Provincial court for trial in the hope that it will contain no record of the inadvertant error. 4)The respondent was correct in dismissing the application for stay of the proceedings. In R. v. Peters, there was no evidence that an accused’s criminal record could be put into a trial as no trial had commenced as it could be said to be untrained.

The plaintiff sues the defendant, claiming a bonus for the 2004-2005 year and the 2005-2006 year. HELD: The claim is dismissed. In law an agreement to come to an agreement is not enforceable. This is especially true where an essential term regarding remuneration has not been agreed to. The parties agreed that they would settle on the bonus amount later on but they never did. The plaintiff believes he is still entitled to a bonus. The Court cannot make the agreement for the parties.",The parties to this action signed handwritten agreement on the 20th day of October 2004. The entire document reads as follows: Contract between the parties: 1) The plaintiff is to provide labor and equipment necessary to feed and maintain the cows for a set price of $0.50 per day. 2) The defendant claims that the eight year term bonus was not enforceable except for the fact that it was in the amount of eight hundred and eight dollars that the plaintiff was entitled to. 3) The parties did not reach an essential consensus on the basis of accurately determining whether the figure should be $800 or $900.

The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage caused to a construction site under a bridge in Saskatoon. The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit. The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of. HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted. The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party. There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer. There is a causal connection between the cause of action plead in the statement of claim and the third party notice. It is immaterial at this stage that the City may have an absolute defence.","FIAT: This is an application by Saskatchewan Government Insurance on behalf of the defendant for an order pursuant to Rule 107(c) of the Queen's Bench Rules and s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act granting leave to the defendant to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party to this action. The plaintiff alleges that the road condition was icy on the exit ramp leading up to the Buckwold Bridge and the City had not taken steps to address the icy road surfaces. The defendant alleges that this ice and snow had built up along the edge of the road such that it acted as a ramp that lifted the truck up and over the guardrail to land in the excavation site. HELD: The application to add Saskatoon to the action is granted as requested. 1) The Court reviewed all of the pleadings and materials and found that the applicant had filed material which established a prima facie claim against the proposed third party. It would appear that the third party was a major player in undertaking the work which is the subject of the plaintiffs loss and claim. To refuse the application under s. of the contributorory Negreligence act would likely result in the requirement for a second litigation process to be commenced, that being by the defendants against the thirdparty claiming contributory negligence. 2) The applicant has not made any causal connection between the cause of the action and the plaintiff's loss and claims."

Prior to being sentenced, he spent 13 days on remand and 2 months under house arrest under s.7.1 of the Young Offenders Act. The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused was 15 years of age and had no record. He assisted the police once apprehended. 2)Although another young offender involved in these offences had received a sentence of 9 months open custody, uniformity of sentence was not a factor to be given great weight in comparing dispositions of young offenders. 3)The sentence was increased to 10 months open custody.","The Crown appeals the disposition of the cases. In addition to the large number of theft offences, the defendant used a stolen vehicle in a high speed chase with the police resulting in extensive damage to the vehicle. The defendant pled guilty to 16 counts of auto theft, one count of possession of stolen auto and one count dangerous driving. He spent 13 days on remand and approximately 2 months under strict parental control on house arrest under s. 7.1 of the Young Offenders Act prior to receiving a disposition of 6 months open custody and 2 years probation on September 7, 1994. The Crown appeals this disposition arguing it is not fit having regard for the number of offences and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice.

The accused, charged with trafficking in a narcotic, sought an order for a judicial stay of proceedings pursuant to s.24(1) and (2) of the Charter on the basis his right under s.11(b) to be tried within a reasonable time has been breached. HELD: The application was dismissed. The delay was not unreasonable.  1)The 25 months between when the charge was laid in May 1996 and the trial date in November 1998 was sufficiant delay to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the delay. Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest. The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay. His right to security of person and to liberty were not affected. 3)Seven months delay was due to scheduling delays resulting from defence's application to remove prosecution counsel who had previously represented the accused. The Crown acted in good faith in opposing the application and had a meritorious position. 4)All other proceedings were within the systemic guidelines. 5)Prejudice to his liberty was minor as he was on bail since shortly after his arrest. He was able to make full answer and defence. He was employed throughout since his release. His inability to enter long term contracts or travel out of province would have existed for 21-1/2 months of the 25 month delay in any event. 6)Individual and family stress is to be expected. The minor prejudice beyond the normal and expected was not sufficient to outweigh society's interest in bringing those charged with criminal offences to trial.","FIAT. The accused sought an order for a judicial stay of proceedings pursuant to ss.24(1) and (2) of the Charter on the basis his right under s.11(b) to be tried within areasonable time has been breached. The date of the alleged offence is May 1996 and the date of its preliminary hearing is November 13, 1998. At that time the accused is on bail. He agrees the delay has not resulted in a diminution of his ability to make full answer and defence. The Court is of the opinion that the earliest time delay will be considered pursuant to s. 11(b)(iv) is the time of swearing the information. This does not mean that the delay is the only time from which the length of delay is to be measured. The Crown did not share the responsibility for this delay. Pre-charge delay is a serious issue and the fact that the accused has been on bail since shortly after his arrest does not necessarily mean that any ruling made by the preliminary inquiry judge would be restricted to the conduct of the preliminary investigation and could not extend to binding the trial judge following any committal."
6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","The court appealed the chambers judge's decision to set aside costs relating to the motion for a deficiency judgment. The court considered s.2 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and found that the amount owed to the respondent was $162,675.72. The portion of the loan attributable to the purchase of the land was 64.03% (64.03%) and was credited against the purchase money portion. The remaining $87,711.72 was non-purchase money debt. The respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings. At that time the balance owed had grown to $536,186.72 and the property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the applicant. The appellant then sought an order returning the matter of the motion to the Chambers judge. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)The court found that s. 2 of the LCRA should be interpreted liberally thereby permitting the sale proceeds ($372,444.01) to be applied to the sale money debt and the non-Purchase money portion to determine the amount of the deficiency judgment; 2)The determination of the amountof the deficiency was governed by the principles set out in Hrynewich Holdings. 3)The Chambers judge pro-rated the percentage owing on both the purchase and non- Purchase money balances. The formula will look like this: $717,275 = $263,928.50  4)The Court was able to adjust the amount awarded to the mortgagee on the basis of the percentage of the sale value owing on the purchase portion of $186,293.72 that was to be paid against the mortgage portion. 5)The respondent was entitled to take out the deficiency against the remaining $186.48 against the nonpurchase portion of that debt. 6)The amount awarded was $165,000. The Chambers judge considered s2 of The Saskatchewan Farm security Act and held that the portion of loan attributable only to the Purchase of the Land was 64% (60,000) and was protected by s.of the LCAA. The amount owed was $372,000 and was to restate the amount paid out of court (sale proceeds) and the remaining LCRA protection $162 million.

Alternatively he sought an order preventing the mother from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The father obtained an ex parte order preventing the mother from removing the child from the province until the return date of the motion. The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994. The father had exercised regular and frequent access. She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties. Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home. HELD: 1)Relocation was neither foreseen nor reasonably contemplated by the judge making the original order. The threshold criteria was thus satisfied. 2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence. The child had a close relationship with both parents. The disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community could not be assessed. 3)The applicant's request for interim relief was denied. If the mother proceeded with her move a revision of the access provision would be appropriate. 4)The child's best interest is the proper test to be applied (Cote) having regard to the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon. 5)The applicant became aware in early June of the mother's intention to move to British Columbia and did not object. The timing of the application, a few weeks prior to the proposed move, raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application.  6)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The respondent applied to vary the terms of the consent judgment such that he would havesole custody of his daughter from Saskatchewan and that the applicant would be entitled to access beyond the minimum prescribed by the consent judgement.

The court was able to embark on a fresh inquiry into what is in the best interests of the children and to assess the effect of a change in the circumstances. 5)The Court was unable, as it was not in the interest of the parties, to assess whether the respondent could have done more to ensure the child's access beyond that threshold. 6)The parties were unable to exercise their custody rights after the trial. 7)The application for interim relief was granted."

The Court was required to decide whether the questions were the proper subject matter of a stated case.

In Hebb v. Family and Children's Services, the Court declined to answer the questions. In this case, the questions were based on a number of questions including: 'How old are you?' 'How long have you been working in child care?' 'Can you believe that these questions predicated on a determination as yet unmade?' 'Are they speculative and hypothetical?' 'Not responsive to the evidence or to any determination made to date in the case and, indeed, by their very wording they are speculative and minute'.

8_2001nssc179.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","The plaintiff/defendant sought reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses it incurred for equipment rentals and other activities it claimed were required because of the failure of the defendant to perform under the contracts. The defendant counterclaimed for damages arising out of losses arising out from losses arising from the unjustified termination of the contract, and as extras for services it had never been paid for. The defendants counterclaimed against the costs arising out the unjustification termination of contract and for services performed under thecontract and extras for which it had not been paid. The court found that the defendant had not responded to the tender invitation by acting under it, but by confirming an amendment to the contract which extended the time to have equipment on site. The plaintiff/plaintiff's claim for reimbursement was dismissed. The contractual obligation to'maintain the banks' was to be construed by the wording in the contract as being the contractual obligation and was not to be amended. The contract was not subject to change. The fact that the equipment was not the same type and model as it listed in the response to the tenders did not have any affect on the delay in commencement of the work. The equipment was used to lift coal from the banks into railcars or trucks for shipment to the customer. The loan and storage of coal from C.N. Railcars was to occur during the winter months. The transport of coal by railcars and truck was to take place during the summer months. During this time, the equipment would be moved from one location to another. The rates charged for the rental of the equipment were based on the tonnages lifted. The rental rates were to be used when equipment was required to be on site, and subject to certain minimum time requirements, for services which were not being used for reasons other than the breakdown of the vehicle itself. The monitoring of the coal delivered by railcar and truck did not occur during this time period as the equipment had been moved from the 'banking station and other stockpiles' to the 'ditches' (the 'banked' and 'banks'). The equipment delivered was not of the same grade and model used in the 'bank' operation. The weight of coal delivered was determined by the tonner and wheeler used as the weight scale. The charges were based upon the tonners lifted and not the tonnen. The graphite and graphite used in calculating the weight of the various coal products was based on a different estimate than the one provided in the tender."
