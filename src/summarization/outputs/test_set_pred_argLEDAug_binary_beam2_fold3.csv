1994canlii4187.txt,"The petitioner sought a divorce and maintenance for herself and the couple's five-year old child. The wife was working and earned a modest income; the husband a substantial one. Allowing the application, that although the wife upgraded her education during the marriage with encouragement and financial support from the husband, she was entitled to maintenance for an indefinite period. The court reviewed the means and needs of the parties and awarded spousal in addition to child maintenance. The court recognized the indirect financial consequences to a custodial parent in raising children.","The wife sought a divorce, as well as maintenance for herself and the five year old daughter of the marriage. The parties had been married 10 years, and had been together for 10 years. The wife sought to have the Separation Agreement and Minutes of Settlement incorporated into a Corollary Relief Judgment. The husband, who had recently retired from his work as a bar manager, sought reasonable access upon reasonable notice. The mother, who was the primary caregiver to the child, was an innately intelligent and ambitious person. The Court awarded monthly maintenance to the wife to terminate in years; the support deadline should not be placed upon her when she has the direct responsibility of raising the child and when the availability of more gainful employment within the foreseeable future is uncertain. On the basis of the $1,500 monthly maintenance, the combined maintenance should not exceed $2,200 and cease in June 1995 and continue for the child at the rate of $600."
1994canlii4796.txt,"The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act. 2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy. The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused. 3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan. 4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer. In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan. There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension.","The applicant sought a declaration under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act that her interest in a group registered retirement savings plan (later defined as the 'Group Plan') was not subject to a security interest she granted to Crown Life. She further sought an order restraining Crown Life from arbitrarily cancelling her participation in the Group Plan. HELD: The application for a restraining order was denied. 1)The provisions of s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act do not apply to the applicant. The taking of security interest by way of a loan agreement contravenes s. 146(2) and s.147(3) as the provisions of the personal property security act apply to this application. 2)The loan agreement contains no provision enabling Crown Life to collapse the applicant's account in the group plan and thereby create an attachable pension refund. If it did, such a provision would violate s.7.02 as previously discussed. 3)Since Ms. Corscadden has not retired and no pension refund exists, there appears to be no reasonable prospect of a proper request for a transfer. 4)The applicant's request for direct transfer does not comply with s.57 of the ITA. The applicant's interest in the plan was not terminated by the defective request for transfer. 5)The provision of s 146(3)(c) does not apply. The provisions of ss.146 and 146(12) are of no assistance in light of the s.8.03 of the PPSA. 5 and 6 of the Plan Contract. 6)The application for restraining order denied. 7)Since the applicant is an insurance company and is authorized to issue annuity contracts, the provisions in s.150(2(3), s.246(2), and S57(1)of the PPPA apply to her. 8)The only exceptions to s.14 of the Act are that the provision of the'specialty pension fund' and the protection of the pension and the right of return under the 'Family Retirement Savings Plan'. 9)The court was of the view that nothing in the plans or the Income tax Act prohibits an annuitant of any rights or interest under the plan from pledging her interest to it. Since Ms.Cadden had not retired or any pension refund existed, there appeared to be a prima facie case for the application for an order directing a transfer of her interest as directed by her.  10)None of the provisions respecting the provision"
1994canlii5095.txt,"The Director of Labour Standards issued a certificate against the City of Regina certifying that it owed a transit employee $318.41 in wages for hours worked in weeks containing a statutory holiday in excess of 32 hours as provided in the Labour Standards Act. The City applied for a review. HELD: The City's application was allowed. Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question. Pursuant to section 72 of the Act, therefore, these particular terms of the collective agreement applied since they were, when considered in light of the balance of the agreement, more favorable to the employee than the requirements of the Act.","The City applied to have the Director of Labour's Standards Branch issued a certificate pursuant to s. 60 of the Labour Standards Act declaring that the City owed its transit employee $511.08 in wages. The Director filed a letter reducing the assessment to $318.41 (including annual holiday pay). At the hearing the Director filed another letter, reducing theessment to less favourable terms. The City brings this application to review the validity of s. 10(1) and 6(2) of the Act. HELD: 1)The provisions of the agreement should govern, and not those of the act. 2)The City filed various documents, including copies of the collective bargaining agreement it has with the Amalgamated Transit Union. There was some evidence before it that the agreement was more favourable to the employees than the Act's holiday pay. 3)In light of the Caxton decision the provisions of this agreement should be set aside and not the Act, as the City filed documents. 4)The agreement's provisions governing pay for holidays were more favourable than the act's."

1996canlii6881.txt,"FIAT. The parties were divorced in 1995 and all issues including spousal maintenance were left in abeyance. The petitioner had agreed to pay $3,000 per month which included child support but the support was reduced to $1,000 and was irregular and late. The two children were living with the petitioner and although old enough to hold jobs, had been unable to find employment. The petitioner's income exceeded $80,000 annually but he had been suspended with pay and the status of his employment was uncertain. HELD: 1)It was premature to fix the amount of spousal maintenance as asked for by the applicant. There were too many unknowns including the future of the petitioner's future job and income and how much the applicant would require should she go to university in the fall and what the children would do about future education. 2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the maintenance. 3)The petitioner was directed to pay $1,500 plus $200.00 per month until the shortfall was paid in full.  4)The applicant was awarded costs of the application.","FIAT. The parties separated in the summer of 1994. All other issues raised in the divorce proceeding were left in abeyance including the issue of spousal maintenance. The husband had reduced the monthly support to $1,000 for the months of September through December 1995 and then reduced it to $900 per month in April and then to $3,000 in May. HELD: 1)The application was premature. There were too many unknown factors surrounding the future situation of either party to conclude that what the applicant asked for was fair and reasonable. There was uncertainty of the husband's future job and income. There also was uncertainty as to what the wife would require if she did go touniversity this fall. There is uncertainty asto what the children of the marriage would do about future education. 2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the $1500.00 maintenance he consistently paid up to December 1995 to $800.00 without at least consulting with the husband. Had these payments continued the applicant would have recovered $6,000.00 at the time of the application. 3)Since the husband had been suspended with pay since December 1995, the wife had received only a total of $ 3,000 per month. She claimed the husband reduced the support for their two children down to $500 for the month of September and December 1995. She alleged the husband was 'unilaterally' reduced the payments for each of the months through December of 1995. 4)Spousal support was not to be varied in any way except in direct way towards the shortfall in the amount of $3000 which was taxed in the usual way rather than in the way it should have been payable. 5)The husband was to continue paying the wife $1.5 million per month for the past 3 years. 6)The matrimonial home had been sold and it was expected each party would receive approximately $30,000 when the net proceeds are distributed. The applicant sought interim support based on some maintenance guidelines suggested by the Government which when the petitioner's and the applicant's current income is taken into account indicates that the respondent should pay around $2,400 per monthly. The petitioner contended this was too high in the interim. He had the two children living with him and while they were old enough to hold down jobs there is a scarcity of jobs to be had. He anticipates one of them would attend university this fall and the other one would attend SIAST. Should his pay be suspended for a period of time or his job lost"
1997canlii787.txt,"After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, the plaintiff, a supplier of materials to the sub-contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub-contractor. The Bond contained a provision limiting the liability of the surety and the principal to make payment to any claimant not having a contract directly with the principal. Dismissing the action with costs, that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier. With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work. As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff. Therefore, the supplier was not entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond.","After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, a supplier of materials to the sub contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a Labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the subcontractor. The contract stipulated that the respondent would be entitled to recover any amount owing to the subcontractor. In the absence of a contract, the respondent could not have obtained a contract directly with the principal. The Mechanics' Lien Act does not expressly state that it binds the Crown. Therefore, the contract did not apply. The respondent was relying on the statutory liens to avoid paying under the Bond while, at the same time, resists paying the statutory lien fund on the basis that there is no money owing to All Ports until such time as it completed the subcontract. HELD: 1)The claims of the plaintiff against the respondent and London Guarantee were dismissed. 2)If the Mechanics'Lien Act had been applicable, the plaintiff would not have been entitled to recovered anything due to the third party statutory liENS. 3)If it was not applicable, then the respondent's claim against the subcontractors would be dismissed. 4)The respondent would pay the costs of Rideau Construction and London guaranteeee which, because they are represented by the same counsel, will be single amount as may be agreed upon between counsel or, if agreement is not possible, will set by the Court at the time an Order for Judgment is taken out."
1999canlii12427.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching contrary to s.271(1) and 153 of the Criminal Code. The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor. The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.,"The accused was charged with offences contrary to s. 271(1) and s. 153 of the Criminal Code. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused touched her vagina and breasts numerous times on a regular basis. He often slept on the couch or in the living room adjacent to the room where the family watched TV. There was a couch or love-seat in the house adjacent to where the complainant usually stayed up at least until midnight. The complainant often went to bed late. She often felt the accused's presence in her room. He frequently came up to her and touched her breasts, her stomach and sometimes her breasts. She called the police. An expert witness testified that he had been drinking and had been assaulted by the accused. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. 1)There was no evidence of his demeanour, which was beyond the reasonable doubt of most of the sexual predators. The only evidence was that he often slept in the basement with the complainant and sometimes he ran out of the room. The touching was over top of her clothing. He said that he was chasing kittens. 2)The accused is not guilty of either the sexual assault or of the touching of his own volition. There is no doubt that he is guilty of both. His behaviour was not demeaning, it was not conducted in a reasonable manner and it was done with reasonable caution and with respect to his alleged sexual predilections. It is not a question of innocence, but of being sexually assaulted. The accused's behaviour is not dangerous, it is not violent, his allegations are not condoning of the assault beyond a reasonable doubt, his explanations for his behaviour are reasonable, his evidence is circumstantial, his reasons for his actions are beyond reasonable doubt and his evidence must be corroborated by the evidence surrounding his allegations. 3)There is no evidence that he sexually assaulted or threatened the complainant. The Court is entitled to take judicial notice of this evidence."

She raised s.9 and 8 of the Charter in objecting to the arrest and seizure of the duffel bag. The voir dire occupied 5 days. HELD: 1)The four requirements set out in R. v. Feeney for a warrantless search were satisfied. The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the duffel bag was incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. 2)The accused had no expectation of privacy with respect to either her friend's residence or the bag. The decision in R. v. Edwards was squarely on point. There was no evidence tying the accused to the gym bag. It was of a different description than the one used in the drugstore robbery. The accused never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it. The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence. 3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter. To exclude the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused objected to her arrest and to the seizure of a duffel bag containing a quantity of narcotics. The police conducted a voir dire as result at the opening of the trial. A great deal of evidence was presented, the majority of which was elicited in very detailed and extended cross-examination.

Ace had been subpoenaed and had been sitting in the Court listening to other Crown witnesses. Defence counsel objected and claimed the Crown had not disclosed this witness. Ace was also a client of defence counsel and so defence counsel would not be able to cross-examine Ace. HELD: The Crown failed to provide proper disclosure to defence counsel, the non-disclosure had an adverse effect of the accused's ability to make full answer in defence and the appropriate remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call Ace as a witness.","The accused was charged with break and enters of homes and was denied involvement. After hearing evidence from the home owners, co-accused and peace officers who investigated the incidents, the Crown advised the court of its intention to call one Ace Carlos Whitecap to the witness box. Defence counsel objected on this basis, arguing that the Crown had ambushed him and his client and that they should not be permitted to do so. The Crown counsel argued that although the Crown's specific intention was to call Whitecap as a witness had not been disclosed to the defence and therefore, he would not be able to cross-examine effectively or at all. HELD: The accused was not permitted to give evidence in this trial. A stay of proceedings was ruled out. The accused's right to full answer and defence had been prejudiced only with respect to the cross-examination of Whitecap. The court found that the only remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call this witness. 1)The accused's defence had met the test of the impunged non-disclosure and the prejudice to the accused's ability to make full answer/defence and the defence flows from not being told that the accused would be a Crown witness. 2)The Crown's failure to disclose its non-closure had prejudiced or had an adverse effect on the accused’s ability to prepare his defence. The defence had not established on a balance of probabilities that the defence was not entitled to exclude the accused from calling this witness; the accused was disadvantaged by the exclusion of other witnesses. The judge found that defence counsel should have had to sit through the entire Crown case in order to be as effective as possible in the cross examination of the witness. 3)The court found it was not appropriate to refuse the application.

2005nssc364.txt,"The Agency applied for permanent care of a young child, with no access to the parents. Each of the mother, the biological father and the psychological father sought to have the child placed in their care. The child had been apprehended due to unsafe and unhealthy living conditions. The mother and psychological father no longer lived together and for the past few months, the mother had been maintaining a clean and tidy apartment and attempting to improve her education and had taken parenting courses. The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child. The mother was against this plan. The biological father only reappeared on the scene after the child was taken into care and acknowledged that the child did not know him as her father. Child placed in the permanent care of the Agency with no access to the mother or the psychological father; access ordered to the biological father for a period of six months at which time the access order will expire automatically unless an application to vary is made; the Agency is to arrange for a parental capacity assessment of the biological father. The child continued to be at substantial risk of physical harm due to neglect if she was returned to the mother's care and the child would be at risk of exposure to violence if returned to the psychological father's care due to the tumultuous relationship between the mother and him. Although some improvements had recently been made in the mother's life, she had a history of frequent changes of residence and did not appear able put the child's needs ahead of her own.

The mother opposed the application and requested an order returning the child to her care. The biological father who had minimal contact with the child was added as a party to the order. The Agency alleged that the child had been in the care of the Agency for more than three years and that there had been a substantial risk of physical harm caused by the mother and psychological father's failure to supervise the child and that the risk of her safety had not gone away. The child had a long history of involvement with the Agency.

The Respondents denied any involvement with her daughter and suggested that counselling be ordered with the mother's assistance. The applicant denied any responsibility for the child's injuries and said that counselling would be appropriate.

2006nssc139.txt,"The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage. The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment. The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child.

Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity. The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","The wife commenced divorce proceedings in November 2004.She sought custody, access, child support, spousal support and costs with a division of property. The husband sought a variation of the provisions regarding child support and child support. It was his position that the particulars of the agreement did not and do not now reflect his net business income derived from self employment. He sought an increase in access. The mother argued that the father failed to negotiate a mobility restriction clause, instead of explicitly indicating his intent he assumed the joint custody order would protect his interests. This agreement clearly favours the mother. The father agreed to the terms of their separation agreement to assure himself that his child would not be removed from his home town and that he was prepared to give her his equity in the home and possessions, guarantee her enough money per month to ensure she remained in the matrimonial home with his son. The parties had separated in June 2004. The petitioner had commenced the divorce proceedings less than a month after the separation and had completed her first two years of employment. She had commenced this process by filing an answer and counter petition in December 2004. It is the husband's position that these particulars of his agreement did, and do, not reflect the net income of his company and that the proceeds of the sale of his motor vehicle, appliances and other household goods will not be used to support the petitioner's needs. The respondent agreed to reduce child support by $5,000 to $3,000 per year and to increase access by $1,000. HELD: The Separation Agreement was found to be inconsistent and should be varied under s.29 of the Matrimonial Property Act or treated like an ordinary variation that occurs when circumstances change relating to support orders. 1)The court found that all jurisdictional elements had been proven and there was no possibility of reconciliation between the parties. 2)The petitioner had sufficient income to support her two children. She did not have to pay child support in the amount of $50,000 a month for two years. 3)The respondent did not engage in any illegal activity. The court valued the respondent's income at $86,000 and noted that it was not unreasonable for the respondent to expect the same amount of support for his children in the future. 4)The Court found that the Separation agreement was not inconsistent in that it did not favour the petitioner. The Court ordered that the respondent be excused from one week child support per month for a period of time. 5)There was no evidence of undue influence"
2006skqb382.txt,"The petitioner seeks child and spousal support. The parties signed a separation agreement and interspousal contract in July 2004. With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1) The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum. The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'. This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support. The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist. 2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program. Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year. The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006. It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000. Child support will be ordered based on $53,000 on an interim basis.","The petitioner sought child support and spousal support pending trial. The parties signed a separation agreement in July 2004. The agreement provided that the respondent was to pay one half of the net income to the petitioner by way of equal monthly payments of spousals. The interspousal contract provided that support would be based on division of income until July 2011. The petitioner had been taking home study courses toward certification in the practice of homoepathy although she had done little of this since December 2004. She hoped to complete the program in the fall of 2006. The respondent and the petitioner had a comprehensive agreement which dealt with parenting, child support, spousaling and the division of family property. The sole source of revenue of the corporation was revenue earned by the respondent's efforts as a computer consultant. In 2005 the respondent earned revenue as computer consultant of $124,128. In 2006 the respondent brought an application to set aside the settlement agreement on the grounds of undue influence and duress or alternatively that the agreement was unfair and unconscionable. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)The agreement was not in breach of the terms of the agreement. 2)The petitioner was entitled to support under the agreement and the circumstances as they presently existed. The court would be careful not to pre-judge the issue and thereby usurp the role of the trial judge. 3)There were no circumstances in which it was appropriate to vary an agreement that the parties had relied upon in structuring their affairs on an interim basis. If interim relief is granted which flies in the face of an agreement, and that agreement is subsequently upheld at trial, the fairness and equity of the interim order may be brought into question.  4)The parties agreed the agreement would constitute a full and sufficient waiver of any and all rights. It would include any changes either foreseeable or not foreseeable, radical changes or changes that may be causally related to the marriage. 5)The respondent was ordered to pay $65,000 in spousousal and child support in the amount of $741 per month for the support of their two children. The amount payable shall be reduced in an amount equal to 40% of the petitioner's income that she has earned. The adjustment will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether the respondent has renewed his contract with the Provincial Government or not. Should there be a discrepancy between the actual income and the anticipated income, the amount will be adjusted when the final amounts are known. 6)In the circumstances this was not"
2007skqb376.txt,"The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated. The application is dismissed.","The petitioner asks the court to vary the child support order granted to the respondent by changing the primary residence of the child to be with the father. The father argues that there has now been a clear declaration in two separate writings of the oldest child's desire to have primary residence change from her father to her mother. Further, there is some evidence that the younger child wishes to also live with her mother or, at the least, live in the same residence as her older sister. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1)As no material change has been demonstrated, this application must be dismissed. 2)There is no principle of law that the wish of a child is absolute and in itself determines the issue of custody. Such an approach would ignore the statutory mandate to take into consideration only the best interests of the children. 3)The children were born, have grown up, and continue to live, go to school and have friends in Nipawin. There is no information before the Court to suggest that this is no longer in the best interest of these children. 4)The test for variation has been set out in cases such as Talbot v. Henry (1990), 151 Sask. R. 168 (Sask. Q.B.) Gerein J. succinctly states the current approach of the court. In each case, the court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the Child. There was a strong indication that at the time the decision was made in 2005, the child had expressed a desire to try living with the mother. She now expresses this desire in stronger terms but it is not change. 5)The court found that as no change had been demonstrated it dismissed the application."
2009skqb36.txt,"FIAT: This is an application to determine interim parenting for the child, Kaira, who is 2.5 years old. There is conflicting information about the nature and extent of the petitioner father's parenting duties. The respondent has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child go with her. The petitioner would like Kaira to remain in Saskatchewan and have regular contact with each parent on alternating weeks. HELD: 1) The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The Court cannot determine on conflicting affidavits what the primary parent status quo is. 2) It is in the best interest that the child see both parents. There was a similar course in Saskatoon that the respondent could have taken which would have made more frequent changes possible, but her affidavit indicates she thinks the Saskatoon course is inferior to the one she is taking in Victoria. 3) Pending trial the child shall be parented by the petitioner for 28 days, and thereafter by the respondent for 28 days and such parenting shall continue to alternate for each 28 day period thereafter until further order. The costs of transportation shall be born primarily by the respondent.","FIAT: This is an application to determine interim parenting for the child. There is conflicting affidavit evidence respecting the nature and extent of the father's parenting duties while the parties lived together. The mother, Lesly, has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child with her. The issues of parenting and mobility are clearly unresolved and may go to trial. HELD: 1) The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The primary parent status quo is Lesly. Lesly has chosen not to take school in Victoria but that does not mean that even if Lesly is theprimary parent that the child will continue to live in Regina or that she will have regular contact with each parent alternating each week. However it is fair that Lesly contribute something to this cost. 2) Lesly will pay for each occasion that Kairsa travels to Victoria for parenting time with Lesly and only for the trip from Regina to Victoria. The costs of transporting Kairas to and from Victoria shall be borne primarily by Lesly; however it was fair that Mike contribute something. 3) Costs in the cause were in the amount of $10,000. 4) The residential status quo was Regina and the child would, pending trials, reside there. The status quo would continue pending trial. The respondent could not determine on conflicting affidavits what the primary parental status quo status quo of the child was. The circumstances were to be determined by reference in Gordon v. Goertz (1996), 141 Sask. R. 241; (1996) 134 D.L.R. (4th) 321. 5) In these kind of cases there is no compelling reason to allow mobility in the case merely because the mother has made some unilateral decisions about her education. There are no compelling reasons to allow the child to reside permanently in Regina but it is reasonable to expect that the status quo will be maintained until trial.  6) The respondent shall pay $150 for each time that Kairea travel to Victoria pending trial and $150 if Lesley wants to parent in Regina and $300 for that trip from Victoria if Lesl wants to, the sum of $150 to pay to Lesly for the return to Regina on the 28th day of Lesly's parenting time and the cost of that trip to Victoria will be borne by the petitioner. 7) The petitioner shall pay for the parenting time by 9:00"
2009skqb445.txt,"The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances. The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1) There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence. In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos. The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","HELD: The motion was granted and the accused was to be provided with full disclosure in usable format. The issues were whether full disclosure would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence and whether the format was appropriate. The issue to be dealt with by Laporte inventory was whether the Crown should embark upon an inquiry and make the appropriate order regarding further disclosure or should that issue be left to the trial judge. 1)The accused had been provided with all documents involved in the prosecution by way of electronic data stored on a hard drive. There is no need for the Crown to provide copies of any officers' notebooks in hard copy and chronological order that postdates the laying of the charges or the issuance of search warrants, whichever is dated later. In this case, the nature and format of disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner. This appears to be a reasonable resolution on the issue of trial fairness. 2)The disclosure provided was appropriate given the nature of the disclosure provided. The format was reasonably accessible and the amount of time it would take the defence to digest and re-examine the material was minimal. The disclosure was appropriate because it allowed the defence an opportunity to review and review the material in a meaningful fashion. 3)There was no need to provide hard copies of all documents. The Crown had the skill, sophistication and equipment to access the electronic data. In a case such as this, the disclosure would be appropriate in a format that did not detract from the right of the accused, who, at the time of the application, was not seeking hard copies, to be exact, to have the entire contents of the documents readily accessible to the defence and, in some situations, to allow counsel's time in locating it. In such a situation, the Crown would be in breach of the terms of the Access to Information Act if the disclosure was not in a usable format and the costs of obtaining the police officers' notebook in full, in chronological order for pre-trial examination and trial cross-examination, would be significant. 4)The notebook format would not be appropriate as there are some 75 police officers that are involved in this prosecution. The cost of obtaining all documents in full in a chronological order would vary with the sophistication of the officer and counsel's ability to access data stored thereon. However, the day will come when the ability to operate personal computer and retrieve data stored at a general public use will be core competency requirement for counsel who wish to act in cases involving volumin"
2009skqb506.txt,"The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession. The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person. The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","The tenant appealed a decision of the Office of Residential Tenancies. The tenant had signed a 3-year lease in the landlord's home and had attempted to rent it for the past three years. The landlord had refused to vacate and the tenant sought an order for possession pursuant to s. 20 of The Residential Tenancy Act. The hearing officer found that she did not have the jurisdiction to deal with the matter. Therefore, the tenant appealed. Allowing the appeal, that there was no valid tenancy agreement between the landlord and tenant and that the hearing officer erred in law by failing to make an order respecting the rights that the tenant had. The Hearing Officer also made an error in law in determining that the landlord was the sole owner of the property. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The tenancy agreement was found to be valid.  2) There was no breach of the tenants' rights by the hearing officers. 3) The Hearing officer did not err in determining the tenant was entitled to the right to possess the rental unit. 4) The tenants had entered a written tenancy agreement respecting their use of the home for the purpose of allowing the landlord to terminate the tenancy. 5) The Court found that the Hearing Officer had not properly served the notice of hearing and therefore could not inquire into the tenant's conduct in the lease agreement. 6) The tenant was not prejudiced by any error or omission in the written agreement. 7) There were other remedies available to the tenant, who may have remedies against the landlord on the basis of estoppel."
2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","The parties, who were together for seven years, were permanently separated. Now, the petitioner seeks access to their 11 year old daughter from an earlier relationship. The petitioner alleges that because he is a'step-parent' to the child, he does not need to establish that he falls within the category of persons having a'sufficient interest' to bring this application. HELD: 1) The petitioner has already had to contend with multiple parents and multiple siblings, many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The court must consider the quality of the relationship, the personality, character and emotional needs of the child and whether the relationship is one that is represented to the world by the mother and the father. The respondent has demonstrated that he is capable of providing that much in the way that he did during the seven years they lived together. While they lived with one parent and one sister, their relationship spanned the years 2000 to 2007. The relationship lasted some time and included the birth of their two youngest children. 2) In this case, the respondent demonstrated he was a person of sufficient interest with respect to the petitioner. The evidence showed that he had a close relationship with the petitioner while she lived with her mother and that he stood in the place of parent to her. 3) The respondent's evidence did not support his contention that he was disadvantaged by the relationship between the petitioner and his two half-siblings. It was more evidence that the petitioner had a stronger sense of entitlement to access the petitioner that would warrant an order for access."
2011nssc455.txt,"The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The charges relate to events which occurred in April and April 2010 respectively. The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases: to reduce the number of counts to three and to separate for trial all of the so-called status offences (pertaining to the events of both April 8th and April 14th). Defence counsel argues that this strategy works unfairly to the accused, necessitating an evaluation of the relevant factors set out in Last at 4. The decision of the voir dire is set out on the admissibility of the accused's statement which was crafted broadly enough to serve as factual summary for this application as well. HELD: The application for severance is dismissed on both the bases proposed. 1) The absence of a true nexus between the counts (a) the complexity of the evidence and the length of the trial having regard to the evidence to be called; and (2) the potential of the defendant deciding to testify on one set of counts (i.e., those pertaining to April 8 and April14th) could not be reasonably balanced against the interests of justice. This is a case where it would be beneficial to have all the counts tried together and thereby be avoided while the accused is in custody. The interests of the justice encompass the accused’s right to be tried on the evidence admissible against him, as well as society”s interest in seeing justice be done in reasonably efficient and cost-effective manner.  3) The only possible link conceded is the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the gun on both days. It is impossible to separate the evidence of proximity and possession on both occasions. There is no common evidence that would allow the Court to infer from the evidence that the gun was not his and that he had nothing to do with the April 8 or the 14th events. There was no such evidence in the circumstances to warrant a separate trial on either day. The only reasonable conclusion drawn from the foregoing is that severance does not reduce the likelihood of a successful severance application because it is more efficient, cost effective, and can be balanced by other circumstances that the judge finds may prevent the accused from testifying or be outweighed by factors that demonstrate that the interest of justice require a joint trial."
2_1999canlii12669.txt,"The respondent seeks an order for interim spousal support. The parties were married in January 1991 with three children and ceased to cohabit in December of 1996. The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT. The respondent sought an order for interim spousal support. HELD: The Court concluded that relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should not take the form of spousAL support. The relief should take from the pension income of the respondent, who is 52 years old and is suffering from a personality disorder. The disability pension income provided by the respondent is $580 per month. When adjusted for inflation the total monthly income is $4,086. This includes mortgage and land tax payments. There is another source of revenue and that is the farm land. The petitioner has de facto possession of the land and receives the entire rental. The difference in value relates to certain farmland which the respondent brought into the marriage. In total there is a section of land one quarter of which contains the matrimonial home. The amount of the rental is $2,292.58. The Court noted that the respondent's pension income was $1,000 less than his total income of $3,474.33. The two parties were married for 22 years and ceased to cohabit in 1996. The husband qualified for a disability pension under the Canada Pension Plan by reason of his mental disability. This provides his basic income of$580.00 a month. The wife has three sources of income: CPP Disability Pension, Disability Insurance, and Pension Benefits. Any payment order will not affect the welfare of the children. The claim for relief is grounded in the fact that the husband does not need financial assistance. He does not manage his finances well and reference in his financial statement the sum in The Federal Child Support Guidelines the related income exceeds $150,000. The actual amount is $210 which is 33 per cent of his present income $630. [1] The Court ordered the respondent to pay $500 as monthly payments in the amount of $6,000 to the petitioner. The balance of $7,000 should be paid to the wife by monthly payments of $500. The court noted that it would be unfair to require the husband to receive half of his income from his land ownership and the other half from his rental income. In the alternative, the husband should receive half the value of the farmland as he brought in the marriage with the intention of selling it and receiving half of it as a share of the 1998 crop. The other half of the rent should be deducted from his income in order to commence spousals with respect to land ownership. The remaining half should be left to the husband in the event he is"

The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault. The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.","The two accused were charged on separate informations with assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and with wilfully damaging the windows of a car. HELD: The accused were found not guilty of the first count on information 24414281. The Court found that both accused were the main aggressors throughout. He smashed in one, if not two, car windows, he chased after the complainant with the help of his girlfriend, and then rushed up the stairs toward the complainant. This was threatening behaviour and the complainant said he felt threatened."
2_2010skqb402.txt,"The defendant applied for dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution. The claim was issued November 1, 1999 and is based in debt for goods and services provided to the defendant. The value of the claim is $521,283.99 and refers to provision of materials, products and services in 1995 and 1996. The statement of defence was filed November 12, 1999 and amended in 2002. In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary. A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48. In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided. Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference. There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case. The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short. While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance. Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial. The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action. The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied.","The defendant applied for the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The defendant had issued a consent order in 1999 which authorized the appointment of a Band Councillor as the proper representative of Ochapowace to be examined for discovery on behalf of the defendant. The consent order was amended in 2002 to order that the defendant return the $40,000 paid by Ochampowace and retained by the plaintiff. In addition to the consent order, the defendant brought an application for discovery in 2009 seeking an order returning the money paid by the defendant to the plaintiff and addressing the issues raised by the pleadings, mediation, and examinations. In this application, the defence argued that the delay in pursuing the action from the time the action was commenced until 2004 when the file became dormant and then remained dormant for some four years until 2006. The respondent responded through its counsel that it now had every intention to proceed with the action. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded costs on a party/party basis notwithstanding the costs that may ultimately be ordered in the cause.  1)The delay was inexcusable and it is in the interests of justice that the plaintiff be permitted to pursue its claim. 2)The defendant will suffer serious prejudice if the matter proceeds to trial. 3)The application for dismissal for the want of prosecute of the action should be granted. The question of whether or not settlement was reached, the circumstances under which this payment was made and the reasons offered for the delay do not reach the level of serious prejudice having regard to the factors listed in the ICC case. 4)The plaintiff's delay in exercising its right to bring the action to trial was inordinate and it should be dealt with by the trial judge.  5)The onus is on the plaintiff, Ochapeowace, to find a way to proceed without delay.  6)Costs awarded to the defendant in the form of an order pursuant to Rule 231 of the Queen's Bench Rules compelling the plaintiff to complete the undertakings given at the examination within 30 days. 7)The applicant's materials fall far short of doing so. 8)The respondent was negligent in arranging for the examination and conducted no correspondence with the plaintiff throughout the course of the litigation.  9)The court reviewed all the relevant facts, which it considered appropriate, and sensitive to the on- the ground realities of litigation with the aim of achieving a result which is just, the Court concluded,"
2_2011nssc486.txt,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","This was a divorce proceeding and the parties were in a shared parenting regime. The mother sought custody and primary care of the children, while the father was a regular user of marijuana and alcohol. The father was to pay a proportionally greater share of the cost of care for the children. The evidence showed that the children needed counseling because of anything their father had done. They may have needed counseling to adjust to the separation or to cope with the conflict created by their parents. However, the evidence also indicated that the father did not have the capacity to assist the children with their homework. HELD: 1) The evidence provided by the father and his witnesses was credible. The information provided by mother and her witnesses in respect to the serious and damaging allegations was not. 2) The court retains the discretion to modify the set-off amount where, considering the financial realities of the parents, it would lead to a significant variation in the standard of living experienced by the children as they move from one household to the other. 3) There was no presumption in favour of reducing parent's child support obligation downward from the Guidelines amount under s9. It is possible that, after careful review of all of the factors in s9, court will come to the conclusion the full table guideline amount is the proper amount of child support.  4) The children were to be in the joint custody of the Father and the mother. 5) Section 9(a) requires court to take the financial situation of both parents into account, but the provision does not include a conclusive formula to determine how the table amounts are to be considered or accounted for. The role of the court is not to determine which parent is better but to decide which plan for the child's care will best meet the children's developmental, educational, health and social needs. 6) There is no presumption that a shared custody arrangement will work against the children in the long run. 7) There appears to be little controversy in the decisions across Canada that the following are, except in very unusual cases, necessities: child care medical and dental insurance premiums post-secondary education physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, hearing aids and glasses Controversy can develop about the arrangements in place for the care of these children because of changes in income and circumstances. The fact that the parties lived and they continued to live separate and apart from one another for a period in excess of 1 year is grounds for concern."
2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused pled guilty to assaulting a peace officer with a weapon. The offence was a serious personal injury offence as defined by ss. 753.1. The offender had 67 prior convictions, four of which were for violence. The offences were violent and involved stabbing the officer to the head. The officer fired his weapon at the accused, striking him in the head and striking the officer in the face. The victim was restrained and the accused ran away from the officer. The Crown appealed the sentence. Appeal to stay the sentence upheld; the accused was sentenced to 10 years in custody. The court found that given the serious nature of the offence, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years, and taking into account the accused's previous record, a sentence of two years or more would be appropriate for the predicate offence, thus making it within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a danger or long-term offender."
3_1995canlii4402.txt,"The respondent expropriated a parcel of land owned by the appellant. Prior to a hearing, all claims for the case were settled for the sum of $20,000. The appellant's solicitor presented solicitor and client accounts of $19,420 plus taxes. The respondent directed taxation, and the appellant's solicitor submitted further accounts for services and disbursements of the taxation hearing amounting to $7,212.24. The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000. He proceeded to tax the account at $14,000, disallowed any costs of the taxation hearing, and disallowed a claim for interest on interim accounts submitted by the solicitor. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal and confirming the taxation, that the taxing master did not make any errors in law. He was entitled to consider as one of the relevant factors the relationship of the total account to the recovery.","The expropriation of land by the City of Halifax City Council in 1993 was a result of a resolution to expropriate the land for widening the Bedford Highway. The land was originally intended to be used as a retaining wall. The construction of the retaining wall began in February 1994 and was completed in June 1994. At the end of the expropriations, the City Council approved the abandonment of the land retaining only an easement necessary for the footing. The solicitor for the appellant appealed the decision of the City to abandon the expatriation retaining only the easement required for the foundation. At trial, the solicitor argued that he had been wrongly awarded $20,000. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the taxation of costs by the Taxing Master confirmed. 1)The appellant solicitor's account was taxed $19,420 plus taxes representing approximately 100 hours time spent on the file. 2)The court found no error in the standard of review outlined in the Rules of Expropriation and Compensation in Canada. 3)The taxing master did not err in principle respecting the interest on unpaid legal accounts. The court was bound by the decision in Dill v. Town of Windsor (1976). 4)There were three errors by the taxing Master in determining that the statutory requirement is not for full compensation for the interest excepting compensation for business loss but for partial compensation for incomplete facts and an amount of compensation for injurious affection. 4)The accountant had prepared a solicitor-client account to the City in the amount of $19 million plus taxes. The accountant had reviewed the invoices prior to the completion of the work. 5)The mere statement of an interest term on an invoice by itself raises no legal obligation for payment of such costs. The TaxingMaster was correct in declining any award of invoice interest. 6)The evidence did not support the conclusion that the initial offer made in an exropriation was not reasonable in all the circumstances."
3_1995canlii6053.txt,"The accused was charged with failing to appear at his trial on a charge of impaired driving. The impaired driving charge was subsequently stayed. When the charge of failing to appear came on for trial the accused claimed a 'lawful excuse' for his failure to appear on the impaired driving charge. His excuse was that the next shift at work had failed to arrive on time and that this had made it impossible for him to get to court on time. This excuse was rejected and he was convicted. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Whether an accused has a lawful excuse is determined with reference to common law principles. It normally includes all of the defences which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 2)The Court was unable to say that the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor could it say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.","The accused sought to overturn his conviction for failing to attend court by arguing that the trial judge ought to have accepted his excuse for not appearing. At issue was whether the accused advanced a 'lawful excuse' for not attending court. HELD: The trial judge rejected the accused's submission that he had a 'lawsful excuse'.  1)The Crown had stayed the original impaired driving charge against the accused, which was stayed by the Crown. The defence argued that the judge should have accepted the defence's submission of an 'impaired driving offence' by way of a return date. 2)The accused had indicated that he would be retaining a lawyer. 3)The trial judge abandoned the defence for the second time on appeal. 4)The Supreme Court of Canada commented on R. v. Holmes which indicate that Parliament can redefine the meaning of 'excuse' to include all defences the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 5)The appeal against the conviction was dismissed on appeal as the accused had abandoned all reasonable and reasonable grounds to believe that the appeal was wrong. The appeal against conviction was not supported by the evidence, the wrong conclusion was made by the wrong conclusions, the proper guidelines were abandoned and the appeal should have been dismissed."
3_1997canlii11217.txt,"Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them. The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996. The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions.","The petitioner brothers were three brothers from the District of Perdue, Saskatchewan who carried on a family farm operation and operated a farm implement dealership business. In 1985, the accountant for the petitioner firm recommended that they become involved in certain real estate partnerships in order to derive certain tax advantages. The petitioner accountant, who had advised the petitionerers that they should become involved, found that the petitioner had ceased to meet his liabilities generally as they become due and thus had to seek a receiving order. HELD: The receiving order was granted.  1)The petitioner was indebted to the petitioner in the amount of $1,000.00 and he had simply refused to pay his obligations. 2)There was no extenuating circumstances which would warrant the Court refusing to grant the receiving order requested.  3)The material discloses the very substantial financial hardships visited upon the petitioner as result of the refusal to pay the indebtedness owed by him. Further, the petitioner has received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships. He has been required to make additional capital contributions to the Partnerships in the form of reduced income taxes resulting from business losses. 4)The respondent was awealthy individual who was quite capable of paying his debts but had simply chosen not to do so. He earned over $1.4 million in his last four years as professional hockey player and had saved a total of $108,625.65 in personal tax liability. 5)The Petitioners had established that the respondent was very clearly indebted to them in the amounts claimed."

The father would have access on alternating weekends and for a three hour period one weekday provided the child was returned by the bedtime set by the mother. Although both parents genuinely love the child and were equally competent caregivers, neither demonstrated that sole parenting offered an advantage to him.

3_2002skca56.txt,"A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users. A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services). The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order. It retained jurisdiction to confirm compliance. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date.","The appellant appealed a decision of the Board of Inquiry appointed by the Minister of Justice under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code which found that the appellant continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services to wheelchair users and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet the accessibility requirements of the National Building Code of Canada 1995.[1] The appellant appealed the decision of Matheson J. confirming the second decision of that Board. The appellant contended that the original order did not include a requirement that it construct washrooms which were accessible to wheelchair reliant members of society. In addition, the Board added a company as a party to the proceedings. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with cost on double Column V.  1)The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order, an order in which it had retained jurisdiction, to confirm compliance with the order and which had been confirmed by the Court of Appeal. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date. The Board acted within jurisdiction in hearing evidence which went to the issue of whether the appellant consulted or did not consult with the Commission and to determine whether the renovations completed by the appellant met the order with the result that it ceased to contravene the Code. The extent of the order, that is whether it was confined to external access of the property or to other 'facilities and services', and whether it had been complied with is the very question the Board reserved jurisdiction to determine. 2)In the result the appeal is dismissed."
3_2003canlii64101.txt,"The mother moved for the dismissal of the pending permanent care trial, arguing that, applying the reasoning in a recent Court of Appeal decision, the court had lost jurisdiction. No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties. The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel. Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed. The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial. When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act. When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date.","The mother sought a dismissal of the motion under the Children and Family Services Act by which the court had lost its jurisdiction to hear the case because the trial was to commence tomorrow. The trial had been approaching the first disposition deadline under section 41(1) of the Act and the original agency planning for the reunification of the mother and child required some psychological counselling. The agency had then proceeded to devise a plan that called for permanent care. The mother had made a protection finding and a disposition hearing, which was successful. At trial, the mother had argued that the time limit exceeded the overall deadline and that the court should be allowed to extend the trial to allow time for that final disposition hearing. Application allowed; trial to continue. The court had no jurisdiction to dismiss the motion."

The accused admitted to consuming one vodka cooler before driving but argued the signs of impairment were manifestations of his panic attack. No .08 charge was laid, as his readings were .07 and .06. HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack. The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As stated in McCallum, the fact that the effects of alcohol may have been exacerbated by the accused suffering from fatigue does not provide a defence to the charge.","The accused was charged with having the care or control of a motor vehicle while his ability to operate a motor Vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The accused's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The accused's blood alcohol content was.60. The court found that the accused's symptoms of impairment were the result of a panic attack not from the consumption of alcohol. 2)The evidence did not support the accused’s diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (G.A.D.). The court noted that the defence had focused on impairment by alcohol, which was not the case with the accused. 3)Although the accused testified that he was in the throws of a Panic attack, his evidence did raise a reasonable suspicion as to the possibility of him being in such an attack."

Emergency medical technicians were not able to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead at the Royal University Hospital. An application for dependants' benefits was submitted over 3 years later. The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim. The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674. HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption. 2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant. 3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing. 4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis.","The applicant sought an order by way of certiorari pursuant to Rule 664 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court, to quash the decision of the Workers' Compensation Board which denied the applicant's application for benefits based upon its finding that the deceased spouse was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of the Worker's Compensation Act. The applicant had become aware of the potential benefits in early July 2001 during a casual conversation at her workplace and suggested that her husband had been performing work duties while on campus to attend class or to study that there might be an entitlement to benefits. The Board denied the application based upon the grounds that the applicant had failed to give notice of the benefits to the Board, and that the respondent Board took into account irrelevant considerations in its decision. HELD: The application for dependants' benefits was denied. 1)Section 45(1)(b) of the Act provides for a six month limitation period for applications in which the applicant can claim benefits. 2)The privative clause determined that the standard of review will generally be one of patent unreasonableness. 3)Section 47 does not bar the applicant from compensation where the board considers that the claim for compensation is just and should be allowed. 4)The respondent Board's decision to deny benefits was based upon two alternative interpretations: 1)Saskatchewan workers' compensation board member Gary Truitt died at the workplace. The respondent Board did not properly or impartially apply the presumption in s.30 of the legislation that it did not apply to the applicant. 5)The applicant was awarded costs of the application pursuant to s.669(3). 6)The appeal was denied on the basis that the following grounds were not properly applied: 1.The applicant failed to provide proper notice to the board of its decision; 2)There was no uncertainty as to the cause of death for the applicant in the circumstances following the death of her husband. There was no compelling reason for the Board's denial of benefits.  3)The court was cognizant of the fact that the spouse's death was a cause of delay in making decisions respecting the respondent board's decision; and 4)There were no compelling reasons for the delay in reaching the decision which led to its denial."

By this fiat an order was granted pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 344 itemizing the household contents and personal items removed by the respondent from the matrimonial home in order to allow for a Writ of Delivery and prohibiting the respondent from disposing of any of the assets that the respondent had removed from the matrimonial home and also requiring him to pay all outstanding utility payments and other expenses associated with his occupation of the matrimonial home. The judge declined to cite the respondent for contempt.,"FIAT. Following a trial before me in November 1993, the Courtissued a judgment dealing with a number of issues including the division of matrimonial property. The judgment dealt with the division into two parts: an order directing the respondent to return the list of items referred to above as matrimony property subject to division and an order preventing the respondent from violating the previous order of November that nothing be removed from the matrimonia home or any assets disposed of. HELD: 1)The respondent was ordered to return to the petitioner the list containing the household contents and personal items removed by the respondent in order to allow for aWrit of Delivery. The respondent was also ordered to pay all outstanding utility payments and other expenses associated with his occupation of the home up to and including December 26/1993 as well as any losses experienced as a result of no insurance coverage between September 28/1993 and December 29/1993. 2)The Court was left with no alternative but to assist the petitioner in regaining the assets taken out of the house by granting the order sought subject to one or two modifications."

HELD: Appeal dismissed and conviction accordingly affirmed.  1)Great deference to findings of credibility made at trial should be shown. 2)The trial judge did not say that he found the accused guilty only upon the credibility of the complainant and the accused. He said that he found the Crown's evidence to be credible, and the accused's evidence not to be credible.

4_2007skqb438.txt,"The parties have two children, a son born March 1990 and a daughter December 1991. A trial on the issues of the son's residence in 2006, the parties' income for the purposes of child support and any s. 7 expenses was held. HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son. This is a period of no more than 5 months. Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.  2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629. The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3) The parties have been divorced since 1998. The son has played baseball since 2004. The daughter has speed skated since 2001. The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father. It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years. The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription. The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%. Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5) Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794. His income is considerably higher now. His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","The respondent father applied to vary an order made May 14, 2002 for child support payable to the petitioner mother on behalf of his two youngest children, Michael, born March 15, 1990, and Jessica, born December 30, 1991. The parties had separated in 1998. The petitioner mother had the use of his mother's vehicle because she was in Viet Nam. In 2006, the father decided to move from the west side of Saskatoon to a larger, more expensive apartment to accommodate what he understood was Michael's interest in moving in with his sister and Jerrilyn, his older sister. The respondent father did not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9. HELD: 1)The parties were responsible for their proportionate share of expenses according to their income. 2)The father was to pay $1,486 per month for s. 7 expenses for a period of no more than 5 months. 3)The mother was entitled to costs in the amount of $500."
4_2007skqb51.txt,"FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","FIAT: The respondent applied for an interim order granting sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s. 7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, October 2005. The petitioner requested joint custody with specified access. While he acknowledged an obligation to pay child support and there was an issue as to his income and whether the interim order should be made retroactive, the evidence before the trial judge indicated that the parties had verbal agreement that the petitioner would have the children in his custody every third weekend during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday as per their verbal agreement. HELD: 1) The respondent was granted retroactive child support of $8,107 for child support purposes.  2) The petitioner was ordered to continue to pay $185 per month directly to the child care provider which represents one-half of the respondent's current child care costs (before tax considerations) for employment purposes. Retroactive support was warranted.  3) The parties' verbal agreement regarding joint custody was not changed. The respondent did not pay any additional child support in the interim and it was not clear from the limited evidence that he obstructed the children from having access at all times. 4) The Court found nothing in the evidence that rebutted that presumption on an interim basis. 5) The court ordered that retroactive support be based on the petitioner's 2004 income. The parties had entered into a verbal agreement in 2005 that the respondent would have access every third Saturday to Monday during his working week. The verbal agreement did not address the fact the petitioner had not seen the children for ten months. The Court was not prepared to attribute additional income to the petitioner until the matter had been resolved by trial judge."
4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The offender pled guilty at the opening of trial to distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The offender had 1,200 postings on the website, which included 11 stories that were the subject of the charge. The site encouraged stories, and the offender encouraged others to submit stories. HELD: The offender was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years, as well as the addition of an order requiring him to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, 2004 for a period of 20 years. The terms of the three-year probation order were as follows: 1) Keep the peace; be of good behaviour; 2) Appear before the court when required to do so by the court; Report to supervisor within two working days from the date of release from jail and thereafter continue to report as directed by the supervisor. 2) Denunciation and deterrence are the dominant principles of sentencing and the Crown submitted the offender did not know such stories were unlawful in Canada. The offences were committed against an eight year old and the child was in the wrong group; 3) Permitting the offender to participate in psychotherapy and one-to-one counselling through mental health services is a reasonable term of any probation order."
4_2009skca102.txt,"The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","The Crown appealed a sentence of 26 months in pre-trial custody and 2 years probation imposed following the death of their 7-month-old daughter. The respondent had been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and had previously been convicted of manslaughter for the same offence. The Crown argued the sentencing judge erred by failing to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability in it. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis of this latter ground. The essential facts were not in dispute. The mother was a model citizen, had a troubled past, was exposed to drug use, domestic abuse and sexual abuse, had failed to take proper steps to protect herself and her children, and had a history of mental health problems. The sentencing judge did not refer to the factors identified as aggravating factors in his reasons for imposing the sentence. These factors were considered and given appropriate weight by the sentencing court.  1) The court was satisfied the sentence imposed was in the range recommended for adult who kill children. 2) There were significant differences in the circumstances leading to the sentencing of the respondent. The factors leading to her sentence were those identified as mitigating factors, the absence of a criminal record, post-traumatic stress disorder, post traumatic stress disorder and the psychological problems of the child. 3) The respondent's dysfunctional upbringing or dysfunctional life was put forth as an aggravating factor. 4) The judge was clearly alive to the seriousness of the crime. The evidence submitted by the parties agreed upon the range of sentences in manslaughter cases. The parties agreed that a maximum sentence of 10 years for offences of this nature, followed by a maximum of 12 years for those found to be aggravating. 5) The sentences imposed were to be set out in R. v. Hathway (R. v.'s Hathway). 6) Leave to appeal the sentence was granted because of the significant differences between the factors listed in the sentence and those in the sentencing decision. The court found the respondent had a high risk to re-offend because of her past criminal record and that her present circumstances were similar to those in that case. The Court found that a sentence imposed for offences that are of a comparable nature to those of this type, with a continuum of severe and violent offending, was appropriate because the circumstances led to the conclusion that the child was most at risk of suffering from post traumatic encephalopathy and post traumaticence syndrome, and because her circumstances had been so severe that she had to seek medical"
4_2011nssc71.txt,"The judge declared the defendants could pay legal fees from third party loans without offending two prior execution orders that prevented them from disposing of any property. The declaration was explicitly made on the assumption that the loans would not be secured against the defendants' existing assets. Later, the defendants' counsel wrote to the court essentially indicating he could not confirm the loans would not be secured against any assets. The court issued this supplemental decision. In the absence of any evidence the loans will not be secured against assets already subject to the execution order, or will not otherwise reduce those assets, the order and declaration sought can no longer be granted.","The defendants sought an order confirming their ability to pay certain amounts for billed and unbilled time without violating the terms of two execution orders previously issued against them, as well as their moving parties. The plaintiffs sought the order in light of a motion by the plaintiffs, seeking an order restraining the defendants from paying any of the legal fees and retainers they incurred in the motion. The moving parties objected, alleging the Court had misapprehended their oral submissions. HELD: The Court was unable to grant the proposed order. The defendants were ordered to pay the retainers and legal fees referred to in the decision of the moving parties; the court could only rely upon the affidavit evidence of Ms. Cochrane relating to the third party loans. The affidavit evidence did not reveal where the loans came from or if they will reduce the exigible assets of the defendants, available for execution."
4_2015skca111.txt,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. In this case, the court found that Turcotte J. had the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 Variation Order (which varied the interim order to $1,000) and found that it did not have the authority to order the payment of retroactive child support. In addition, it held that the Court could not overturn a decision of a Queen’s Bench judge dealing with the same lis. The court distinguished between interim orders and final orders and noted that in the case of family support orders, the final order made pursuant to the terms of the 2006 Consent Child Support Order (CPSO) was not intended to be a final order and was subject to further determination by the Court. The Court also held that it had no authority to vary an interim order on an interim basis. In fact, it drew a clear distinction between interim order and final order. In the case involving the child support order, the Court found that the parties had agreed to vary it in accordance with the parties’ agreement and that the central issue was whether it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied. The respondent filed an “Application for Variation” with the court. It was based on an application by the applicant that the respondent had reduced the primary residence of his former wife to a different location and accordingly the respondent was entitled to vary that residence. The application for variation on the basis of arrears arising prior to that date was dismissed on appeal."

The Plaintiff called several expert witnesses who testified that, in their opinion, the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire. Ford called one witness who was the designer of of the truck's fuel system and a Ford employee. He testified that the defective fuel line could not have leaked sufficient fuel to cause the fire. He also admitted, however, that his prior written report contained errors. Rebuttal evidence called by the Plaintiff indicated that the check valve in the fuel pump designed to prevent siphoning from the fuel tank in the event of a leaking fuel line did not operate as the Ford witness had testified.

The Plaintiff's experts' evidence was accepted over that of the Ford expert. No independent experts had been called by Ford.","The plaintiffs claim against the defendant for damages from a fire in their garage which they allege was caused by combustion of vapours from gasoline leakage from the fuel tube of a new truck they purchased from Ford.

HELD: 1)The plaintiffs have proven beyond a balance of probabilities that the fire was caused caused by an electricstatic discharge throughthe U- shaped fuel tube. Due to extreme weather conditions the electrical insulating qualities of the nylon fuel line were reduced to an extent that the vapours would settle to the bottom of the garage and would be attracted to the pilot light on the furnace. 2)The defendants claim damages in the amount of $50,000 awarded to the plaintiff for general damages, $5000 for the cause of the fire, and $1,000,000 in damages for failure to take appropriate steps to prevent the leakage. 3)The plaintiff was awarded the sum of $10,000 as general damages and the $2,500,000 for loss of profits. 4)The court accepted the expert testimony of the plaintiffs and the defendants in preference to the defendant in that the plaintiffs had proven the cause and origin of a fire beyond a reasonable doubt.

The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing.

The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","The respondent SGI terminated the plaintiff's income replacement benefits pursuant to s.185 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The plaintiff argued that SGI had terminated his benefits on the basis that he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: SGI's termination of benefits was appropriate and the plaintiff was entitled to a full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work.  1)SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to the plaintiff prior to and after the accident was considered. 2)The plaintiff was found not guilty of all counts. 3)The court found that SGE was not entitled to terminate the plaintiff\'s benefits pursuantto s. 185(d), (e), (f) or (g) of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations. 4)SGE's claim for the difference between the amount paid to the victim and the amount actually paid to him for the period September 24 to October 23, 1997 and to the date of his commencement of employment in Alberta was dismissed."
5_2000canlii3680.txt,"After being sexually assaulted, applicant was voluntarily released from Canadian Armed Forces. She applied for and was denied a pension. Civil proceedings were commenced and the Crown defended on the basis that before initiating civil proceedings, applicant was obliged to appeal denial of pension or seek review by Minister of pension rejection. Applicant applied to strike out that portion of defence application allowed. The applicant applied for and was denied a pension. Therefore no pension was at this time payable to her. A review by the Minister would require new information and the appeal period had expired. The applicant should not be denied her right to proceed against the Crown in such circumstances.","The plaintiff was voluntarily released from the military after a seven year period following the sexual assault. She applied to Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) for a pension under s. 111 of the Pension Act. The Minister of Defence later reversed the decision and the plaintiff was barred from bringing this proceeding. She also failed to appeal. The limitation period for appealing the Minister's decision had expired and she was not in receipt of pension benefits. The Crown appealed the decision. In giving the plaintiff the benefit of a pension, the court noted that s. 11 of the Pensions Act provides a mechanism for the plaintiff to bring an action for damages against the Crown where a pension is being paid or is 'payable'. It was also inconceivable that having been denied the application for pension the plaintiff is precluded from bringing the proceeding because she failed to attend court in time. The court concluded that the Crown could not meet the onus on the admitted facts because the plaintiff had never made an application for one. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the action was allowed to proceed. 1)Section 111 is a statutory defence and the only mechanism available to a plaintiff is the filing of a grievance. The plaintiff must prove facts to bring the case within the ambit of the Act. 2)The limitation period was extended to three years from the date of the decision in Gustar v. Canada (1998). 3)The plaintiff failed to pursue the administrative process in favour of bringing the action for civil action. 4)The Crown did not meet s. 18 of the Federal Courts Act. 5)The court noted in its decision that the limitation period had expired. 6)The doctrine that recourse to alternative bodies is bar to court actions has been considered by the courts in various contexts and is applicable to this instance."
5_2001skqb463.txt,"This judgment applies to both QBG No. 1040/98 and QBG No. 1041/98 respecting the contract between the city and Triple P Holdings and the January 21, 1997 contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required. The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.","The two contracts that play in this case are the contract between the City of Regina and Triple P Holdings operated by the defendants and the same two defendants. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the City, the general thrust of all of the evidence was that certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to the members of the Independent Truckers Association. The plaintiffs failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged on that breach and that any breach occurred. HELD: Each case was dismissed. 1)The plaintiffs had constructed their cases in reliance upon the overall affect of both contracts with specific emphasis on the contract of January 1997. The factual evidence was in conflict but found that the defendants made some effort to include the plaintiffs in the rotation. Problematically, for the plaintiffs, there is no contractual obligation in the agreement of January 21, 1997 which requires the defendants to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work and the Contract between the plaintiff and the City is not incorporated by a specific or general reference. 2)The issue of privity of contract could have been a critical issue in different circumstances but in the end this case will not turn on the question of privitity. 3)The case will look to see if the plaintiffs have made out the case that they have constructed. 4)The single issue is overwhelmed by the larger issue as to what really is the contract alleged to have been breached. If the plaintiffs had intended to present the case the contract was the whole arrangement between the city, the Association, the contractor and the truckers, they would have had to draw in all the parties, including the trucking association and the city of Regina as well as all the related documents."

5_2003skpc19.txt,At issue in the negligence suit was whether the defendant ought to have seen the plaintiff's vehicle in front of him and stopped his vehicle to avoid the motor vehicle collision. The only material difference in testimonies was whether there was a half-ton truck in front of the plaintiff's vehicle when the collision occurred. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was not proven on a balance of probabilities. The physical evidence did not assist and the court was unable to conclude that one version was correct and the other incorrect.,"An action in negligence arising out of a vehicle accident. A tractor-trailer slowly inched up to a Honda Corrolla automobile operated by the plaintiff and nudged it causing damage to the back bumper, a slight denting on the trunk lid and some damage to tractor unit. The ultimate disagreement was over the issue of whether the defendant ought to have seen the plaintiff's vehicle in front of him and therefore, stopped his vehicle thus avoiding the collision. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed without costs to either party. The physical evidence did not support either version of the facts put forth by the parties.  1)The scales of justice were evenly balanced and the evidence was, at the end of the day, equivocal. The scales were not weighing persuasively in favour of either the plaintiff or the defendant based upon the oral evidence given by the witnesses at the trial. 2)The evidence was not equivocally supported either versions of the events related to the court by the defendant and the plaintiff respectively. 3)The plaintiff was not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his claim had been proven.  4)The physical evidence was equivocative. It could not support both versions of events related the court's mind and manner of looking at the facts."
5_2004skca60.txt,"The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of the Municipal Board Act. The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply abnormal obsolescence to the owner's property. The issues also relate to 15 other properties and as the issues are the same for each property they were decided by the Assessment Appeals Committee on one appeal. The Assessment Appeals Committee dismissed the appeals, finding the issue not to be a matter of the Assessor's Discretion but a matter of professional interpretation of data. The Committee found the Board of Revision did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err on the issue of abnormal obsolescence for size. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted on two questions of law.  1) Did the Committee err in its interpretation and application of the Saskatchewan Assessment Manual by failing to find that economic obsolescence for size must be categorized on a MAF by MAF basis? 2) Did the Committee err by failing to find the Assessor should have used the comparable unit method to determine whether an adjustment for obsolescence for size should be applied to the applicant's property? 3) On the use of invalid sales leave was denied on the basis the question of the sale is a question of fact and in argument the applicant said for its purposes the impugned sale did not matter. 4) Leave to appeal was denied on the issue of the standard of proof that there was no error demonstrated.","The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. The issue is the use of invalid sales and the alleged improper onus or standard of proof. The sales were representative of many different MAF neighbourhoods and the issue of the aggregation of the Maf neighbourhoods merits consideration. The Assessor determined the specific MAF neighborhoods based on industrial property sales. However, the determination was necessary because the market operated differently in each neighbourhood and properties had to be segregated in order to value accurately. The factors of economic obsolescence are considered when the Assessor determines the MAF for each neighbourhood. The MAF in a given neighbourhood might capture all of the economic and financial obsolescences but there is only some of it such that the abnormal economic obsolescentence could be a significant factor. The Committee did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not erred on the issue. Leave to appealed was denied."

The issue is whether the plaintiff's claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act, and if so, whether the affidavit filed in support of the issuance of both of the pre-judgment garnishees complies with s. 3(2) of the Act. HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.  1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons. 2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand. Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement. 3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant. The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing. Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act setting aside the plaintiff's pre-judgment garnishee in which $2,291.90 was paid into Court from the defendant's bank account at Biggar and District Credit Union on December 7, 2005. The issue was whether the claim was a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act and if so, whether the affidavit of the plaintiff filed in support of the issuance of both the pre- and garnishees complies with s.3(2). HELD: The application was dismissed with fixed costs.  1)Pre- and/or garnishete summonses are not an extraordinary remedy and failure to strictly comply with the provisions of the act goes to jurisdiction and renders the garnishthee summons nullity. 2)The affidavit material did not meet the required precision the amount of the indebtedness owing on the judgment, the debt or the liquidated offer and the statement of defence and counterclaim filed by the applicant was not considered. 3)There were four purposes of the affidavit filed pursuant to the Act: a prejudgment payment, a debt or liquidation demand, and a garnishhee summons.

5_2006nsca41.txt,"The plaintiff company commenced an action against a former employee/shareholder for breach of fiduciary and employee duty. The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company. The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action. The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","The appellants sought an order permitting the respondent to commence a derivative action against the former chief executive of the company and to add a claim for an 'oppression remedy' pursuant to s. 5.03 of the Companies Act. Oickle, the other appellant, and his new counsel applied for an order reversing the respondent's decision to withdraw the admissions and for an adjustment in the wording of the statement of claim to a claim that the respondent had been prejudiced in his dealings with the company by the fact that he no longer worked for the company. The respondent applied to have the matter heard by the Court on its own merits. Dismissing the appeal, that the judge did not apply a wrong principle or make an unjust order. The only difference between the two lines of cases is that one of semantics not substance, relying on Tymkin v. Winnipeg (City) Police Service, [2003] M.J. No. 284, 20.

5_2006nssc43.txt,"The plaintiff alleged that a small piece of metal seen dangling from beneath the defendant's tractor trailer flew out from under the trailer as it passed the plaintiff's vehicle and hit her engine hood, bounced in the open window and caused her to lose control of her vehicle. She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control. The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled. Application for summary judgment granted; the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success. The plaintiff cannot resist a summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff's credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge.","The plaintiff was driving from Halifax to Seabright when a tractor-trailer passed her vehicle. She alleged that a piece of metal fell off of his vehicle, fell to the pavement, bounced on to the engine bonnet of her vehicle and hit the windshield of the plaintiff's vehicle. The plaintiff claimed damages for injuries to her arms, shoulders and neck. The defendant engaged two experts to examine the piece of wood and reported that it did not come from the tractor- trailer. The experts concluded that the piece had not flown from the trailer and therefore there was no issue to be tried. Regarding the claim for property damage, the trial judge found that the defendant's vehicle was not and never been a truck and the onus of proving the injuries were not entirely or solely arising through his negligence was placed on the plaintiff. The expert reports did not show any connection between the alleged rate of speed and the mishap of the flying metal piece and the fact that the pieces of metal had not been dangled from the truck. HELD: The defendant had met the threshold test and had met it. There was no genuine issue for trial and the plaintiff had not demonstrated a material fact requiring the court to make a determination of credibility. The claim for loss of property, injuries to the eyes and neck were all but dismissed. The court found that there was a real issue for a trial and that the only way to determine whether the claim had any real chance of success was to use Civil Procedure Rule 13.01(a) and Supreme Court of Canada judgments and to rely upon the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal's decision in Jagar Industries v. Gordon Capital Corp. (1999) S.C.R. 423 (S.C.) where that court adopted the S. 7.5 test for summary judgment applications where the claim of loss of value and value as well as the evidence of expert reports filed by the defendant were considered."
5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving and one count of having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol content exceeded.08. The accused argued that the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a blood sample demand pursuant to s. 254(3)(b) of the Criminal Code, even though he was in the driver's seat. The evidence showed the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. Defence raised a number of issues, including whether the accused's condition was potentially serious, if the accused was incapable of providing a sample of his breath, if there was any impracticable condition associated with the consumption of alcohol, whether his health was at risk from the alcohol consumption, whether the Court had a duty to inquire into the health of the accused prior to making the demand, if any of the above, and if the Court could find any reasonable person who might reasonably believe that the accused had de facto care or control of an inoperable motor vehicle. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. 1)The accused had reasonable, probable and probable ground to believe that he may be incapable of giving a sample. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. 2)All of the requirements of s.254(3) had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The totality of the evidence would have led any person to that conclusion. Law enforcement is important but must clearly wait until law enforcement is involved in a serious investigation to make an informed decision. Law Enforcement is also important but, in this case, the accused is deemed to be in care and control of a motor vehicle by virtue of the presumption found in s.258(1)(a). The Court held that the Crown must not enter the analysis of whether the officer's s.10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way. 3)The Court held with respect to the other counts, that the officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke with a lawyer in private. There was no other evidence that established the accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion."
5_2008nssc113.txt,"The mother of two boys, ages 12 and 13, applied to vary access to add a condition that the father only be allowed to drive with the boys in the HRM, on roads with a speed limit of 80km/hr and under. She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party. Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work. She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","The father applied for access to his children at a settlement conference. He was denied access and the children had an argument that resulted in his decision not to drive. The father applied to have the access restricted on his behalf, alleging that the mother had been misleading him and his children. Application dismissed; the evidence showed that the father's medical condition and its effect on his driving was real and not an attack on his independence; the court was not satisfied that his use of marijuana was benign and without potential risk for his children; the father must have renewed his prescription to use marijuana. The court found that concerns relating to the father’s medical condition, his marijuana use and his driving were minor and were not connected to the issues raised by the assessment report; the best interest of the children was not to have restrictions on his access. The evidence showed the father was able to drive safely on routes that permit speeds over 80 km/h if the drive was lengthy."
5_2008skca56.txt,"The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment. The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault and using a weapon contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and s. 267(a) of the Code. He was tried by a jury, which convicted him.  He was sentenced to two years in a federal penitentiary plus two years probation. He appeals both his conviction and sentence. HELD: The appeal against conviction is dismissed.  1) The trial judge did address the jury at the outset of the trial and provided guidance to the jurors on the issue of credibility. The judge stressed the reasonable doubt standard and concluded his charge with the direction consistent with R. v. W.(D.). 2) The charge met the standard of review and the appeal is allowed. The sentence is reduced to one that would allow the appellant to have no appeal against."

He had a previous record for non-violent offences., defendant sentenced to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment; aggravating factors included the defendant's possession and use of a handgun in an area where a number of people were close by and that a bullet had found its way into a nearby residence.","The two accused were jointly charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in relation to shootings in the early morning hours of December 10, 2006. Following a preliminary inquiry, both accused were committed to stand trial on April 4, 2008. Both remained in custody until October 29, 2008 when they were released on judicial interim release under the Adult Bail Supervision Program. In this case, the accused served approximately 17 months of pre-trial custody while on remand and he should be credited 34 months for this dead time. The offence was particularly serious because of the presence of at least 2, probably handguns being fired in an area where a number of people were close by at the after hours bar known as Vegas. Quite a few shots were fired and two persons died as result of the gunfire. The accused was acquitted of the two counts and he was not being sentenced for those offences today. The fatalities were mentioned simply to highlight what the result of indiscriminate gunfire can be. HELD: The global sentence to be imposed is one of years, months incarceration. There will be an order under s.109 prohibiting the possession of firearms, ammunition and explosives. A prohibition order will be for life, and there will be a DNA order. The sentence imposed should reflect society's abhorrence of those who decide to live by the gun and use the gun to settle disputes."
5_2011nsca46.txt,"The defendant, who was found guilty of the careless use of a firearm, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace and possession of a restricted or prohibited firearm applied for bail pending appeal. He had been found, in his residence, with a firearm licensed in Alberta but not licensed to be brought into this province or possessed here. The defendant had residences in both Alberta and Nova Scotia but his Halifax residence was now up for sale and he travelled extensively around the world for his work. Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction. Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions. The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","The appellant appealed his conviction for offences relating to careless use of a firearm and unlawful possession of a weapon. The appellant contended the trial judge erred in failing to find a breach of the Charter when the police entered the appellant’s condominium and failed to grant remedy as a result. He also contended the minimum sentence provisions of s. 95(1) were unconstitutional. In his appeal, the Crown argued that the appellant was a flight risk because he had not established that he would surrender himself into custody as required by s. 679(3)(b) of the Code and had suffered credit card fraud as result of his convictions. In addition, the appellant argued that he had a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction and that his upcoming plans included working outside the country. Ordering the appellant released on the basis that he did not have a prior criminal record, he had complied with the terms of his release pending sentencing and then consented to an amended recognizance which allowed him to travel throughout Canada. The terms of the release were inadequate."
5_2011skca26.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving and alleged that his estranged wife and daughter lied. The appellant had been represented at trial by experienced counsel but undertook the appeals himself. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appellant had not followed procedures that must be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving to the Court of Queen's Bench and, having failed, then appealed to this Court. He was convicted at trial on the basis of the testimony of his estranged wife and their daughter, whose accounts of what occurred were accepted by the trial judge. The trial judge found both to be credible witnesses. He also rejected the appellant's account, finding that he was not a credible witness. The appellant took the appeals himself. He contended that, in the circumstances, he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice inasmuch as he has evidence that his estranged Wife, out of a desire for revenge, had lied about what occurred. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)There were no tenable basis for allowing his appeal, setting aside his conviction, and ordering a new trial. On the facts, the trial court based on the judge's assessments of credibility, the conduct of the accused amounted to dangerous driving within the meaning of the applicable provisions of the Criminal Code. 2)The Court of Appeal had no choice but to act upon the allegations of this nature. There were procedures that had to be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence. These procedures were not followed and there was nothing before the Court upon which it might act."
5_2013skpc45.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the installation and monitoring of temperature monitoring equipment for its meat cutting business. The defendant monitored the temperature in the freezer and cooler at the business. The plaintiffs sued because their freezer failed and meat spoiled after a circuit breaker at the business tripped off. The defendant had received no alarm. The plaintiff asserts that the defendant breached the contract by failing to properly monitor the temperature in the freezer. HELD: The contract between the parties was solely for installation and monitoring. The contract did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair the equipment at the plaintiff's business. The Court was satisfied that the defendant was monitoring the signal from the plaintiff's business on the dates in question and no alarm was received. It is not possible to say with any certainty why the defendant did not receive an alarm, but the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff was regularly having its monitoring equipment serviced or repaired. The plaintiff has not proven that the defendant breached the contract. The action is dismissed.","In 2006, Sturgis Meats entered into a contract with Gardon Securities. That contract covered both the installation of temperature monitoring equipment and the month to month monitoring by the defendant of the temperature in the freezer and cooler of this business. Even with this dispute, the defendant continues to monitor those temperatures at the business. That monitoring is done by the defendants staff in Yorkton, based on information transmitted by the monitoring equipment over a telephone line from the plaintiff. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to the defendant. Based on the original contract between the parties and ongoing payments being made in 2010, the contract was solely for the monitoring of the temperatures in the cooler and freezer at the company and did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair the monitoring apparatus at the premises. The monitoring equipment was in good working order at the time of the incident and no freezer alarm was received before the alarm of August 15, 2010. The defendant says that the obvious cause of the fact that no alarm was not received by the plaintiff was either a failure of proper maintenance or was adjusted improperly by someone other than an employee of the plaintiff; given the exclusion clause in the contract which am satisfied is enforceable, the issue becomes whether there was a cause beyond the plaintiff's control which resulted in no such an alarm being received by them so it could be reported to Sturgs Meats. It is not possible on the evidence to say with any certainty why the defendant did not receive such an alert generated by the rising of the freezer temperature at the plaintiff on or before August 14. It was possible that there was so-called a glitch in the monitoring system that resulted in the failure of the equipment at the defendants. There is no evidence to that standard that the reason the defendant breached this contract by failing to monitor the temperature at this business was within their control. The plaintiff was awarded costs."
5_2014skca95.txt,"Civil Procedure – Appeal – Leave to AppealLand – Certificate of Pending Litigation The appellant sought leave to appeal the chambers decision not to vacate the certificate of pending litigation registered on behalf of her estranged husband, who was deceased. The respondent’s solicitors filed the certificate of pending litigation after his death. The appellant transferred the land subject to the certificate of pending litigation into her name only and entered into an agreement to sell the land, which could not proceed with the certificate of pending litigation. HELD: The appeal was of sufficient merit and it was not prima facie frivolous or vexatious. The appeal, however, was not found to be of sufficient importance to the practice of law or the Court of Queen’s Bench to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal. There was no new, controversial or unusual issue of practice raised by the appeal. The issues were determined to be better left for resolution by the Court of Queen’s Bench after hearing vive voce evidence at trial.","The applicant sought to appeal from a chambers judge's decision not to vacate a certificate of pending litigation registered on behalf of her estranged husband, who was deceased and his estate was represented by his executors. The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The applicant had not considered whether the chambers judge had exceeded his discretion in exercising his discretion within the criteria set out in Rothmans, Benson &amp;amp;and in the absence of any objection, her application proceeded on that basis alone, with her notice of appeal deemed to be 'draft notice' of appeal. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The proposed appeal does not raise a new or controversial or unusual issue of practice, nor does it raise a valid question of law based on the facts of this matter, it does not bear heavily or potentially prejudiced the prospective outcome. 2)It is not pertinent to conclude the proposed appeal is of sufficient importance to the proceedings before the Court of Queen's Bench or to the field of practice or the state of the law or to administration of justice to warrant determination by a panel of the court. The Court's function at the outset is one of review only: review to determine if the judge abused his or her discretion. 3)While the proposed Appeal might be of sufficient merit to warrant the Court's attention at a later time, it might not have the potential to succeed while the whole field is still under investigation. 4)The applicant might have the benefit of a fair hearing."
6_1990canlii4137.txt,"This was an application under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the two appellant university professors was invalid and denied the rights of the appellants as guaranteed under ss. 15(1) and (7) of the Charter, and an order for reinstatement and back pay. Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s. 15(1), 24(1) and 52(1)(b) of the Charter of Rights for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the rights of the applicant as guaranteed under s15 and s7 of the Canadian Charter of rights and Freedoms and that the applicants be reinstated as full-time members of the respondent immediately and that pay to the applicants all compensation due to them as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest, and costs of the proceeding. In this case, the respondent is a wholly independent institution of post-secondary education which manages, administers and controls its property, revenue, business and affairs through its Board of Governors and administration department. Allowing the application and ordering the payment of all compensation, that the respondent does not have a direct connection with the human rights regime in the province and, in the area of private discrimination, is not an alternative tort system. This case is one of three set out in the Harrison case, which reviews case law as it has developed and is awaiting decision by the Supreme Court of Canada. In these cases, the government does not control the core functions of the University, including its relations with staff. The applicant is entitled to seek damages against the respondent for his actions in relation to the termination of his employment as a result of the collective agreement between the respondent and the Faculty Association. The respondent is also entitled to costs."
6_1994canlii3963.txt,"The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana, contrary to s. 4(2) and 6(2) of the Narcotic Control Act. RCMP had investigated a tip that a large crop of marijuana plants was being grown on a private property located in a clearing off a woods road. They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants. At trial, the court held their right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure had been violated, and acquitted them. The Crown appealed the acquittal. Per Roscoe, J.A., Chipman, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that there was no s. 8 breach because the respondents did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the field where the marijuana crop was growing. The court reviewed case law regarding 'open fields', and 'uncultivated' lands, and adopted the reasoning in Oliver v. United States, 104 S.Ct.1735(1984) in reaching its conclusion. Per Pugsley, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that the respondents had a reasonable expectation of privacy in activities carried on by them on their private property. As there were no exigent circumstances, the search was not reasonable and the evidence should be excluded.","The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana and were acquitted on the basis of a voir dire held to determine the admissibility of evidence obtained by the police as a result of the seizure of 100 marijuana plants. The trial judge found that the police did not have reasonable grounds for their belief that the property searched contained narcotics, that they only had a mere suspicion, and that the warrantless search violated their s. 8 Charter rights. The respondents appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge erred in concluding that the evidence was not admissible. The appeal should be allowed and a fresh trial ordered."
6_1996canlii6791.txt,"Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless. The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse. At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages. They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.","The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their two boys. The mother, who had been the mother's counsellor, and the father, who were both medical professionals, claimed that the mother, his ex-wife and child and family counsellors had wrongfully accused them of physically and sexually abusing the children. HELD: 1)The mother's admission and evidence did not relieve the father of his responsibility to look after the children and to assist in the investigation of the allegations. 2)The evidence was so rotten that a written apology could not be accepted. 3)The court dismissed the application. It held that the statements were made with express malice and that the evidence was not credible. 4)The co-defendants were ordered to pay $600 costs. 5)Costs were left to the court."
6_1999canlii12571.txt,"The constable sought a writ of prohibition to prevent the respondent hearing officer from proceeding with the hearing into his conduct pursuant to discipline charges brought against him by the Chief of Police on the grounds there were contraventions of the Act, the Municipal Police Discipline Regulations and the rules of natural justice and the duty of fairness which resulted in the hearing officer having exceeded or lost jurisdiction to proceed with the hearing. He sought a declaration that a member of the police service must be informed of any investigation of his conduct prior to the commencement of the investigation as required by s.54 of the Police Act.; the Act does not permit the amendment in Form A discipline notice since it is a statutory form. The relief sought regarding disclosure had been abandoned by the applicant. The applicant argued that the fundamental questions to be addressed revolved around issues of statutory interpretation that must be resolved on a standard of correctness and the alternative remedies were not adequate. The respondent took the position that this Court should not entertain the application as there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act by way of appeal to the provincial Police Commission; that the Chief was entitled to amend the notice and would be entitled to grant leave if required; the hearing officer erred in holding that s.54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the subject member. HELD: The application was dismissed. There is an adequate alternative remedy which should be pursued. There were no 'special circumstances' upon which the court should exercise its discretion to determine the merits of the application.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of prohibition to prevent the respondent hearing officer, in his capacity as Hearing Officer under The Police Act, from proceeding with the hearing into the applicant's conduct pursuant to discipline charges brought against him by the respondent police chief. The respondent had refused to provide the applicant with a copy of the Form discipline notice. The applicant argued the fundamental questions to be addressed were not the only issues to be resolved on a standard of correctness. HELD: 1) The applicant was granted leave to appeal.  2) The hearing officer's jurisdiction was limited to the hearing in accordance with s. 54(1) of the Police Act. 3) The jurisdiction of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal was reduced to an amount equal to or greater than the maximum permitted by the Act. 4) In some circumstances the hearing could proceed even though the residual discretion in the court will ordinarily be exercised in denial of certiorari. Only if special circumstances are present will the courts exercise their prerogative power and quash on certioraris. 5) In any event the jurisdiction remained the same as in the previous proceeding. 6) The court was in good position to deal with the issue as it was in a particular circumstances to isolate and balance the factors which were relevant. 7) There was insufficient evidence to determine the merits of the application. The alternative remedies were not adequate. 8) The convenience of the alternative remedy, the nature and extent of the error, and the appellate body (i.e., its investigatory, decision-making and remedial capacities) did not outweigh the fact that there was insufficient time to prepare the evidence. 9) The board heard full evidence on the jurisdictional facts going to natural justice. 10) In all circumstances there was an adequate remedy by way of appeal provided for by the legislation. 11) The respondent was awarded the costs of the appeal. 12) In the exceptional circumstances the court should exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction at this stage to prevent further denial of natural justice  13) The right of appeal to the senate committee constituted an adequate alternative remedy and even better remedy than recourse to the courts by pre-rogative writs. Several factors should have been taken into consideration, including the procedure on appeal, the composition of the Senate committee, its powers and manner in which they were probably to be exercised by body which was not a professional court of appeal and the burden of previous finding, expeditiousness and costs."
6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT. The applicants, charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana, plead not guilty to the charges. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two provisions of the authorization: a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance and a search warrant authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. (3) A search warrant to search the applicant's residence which resulted in the seizure of 365 plants and led to charges against both applicants. The Crown argued that the authorization should be set aside as information obtained from the electronic surveillance was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant and the subsequent search warrant both of which were derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful. HELD: 1) Leave to cross-examine was granted when the trial judge was satisfied the authorization was necessary to conduct a cross-examination of police witnesses with respect to an authorization for surveillance was granted. Leave should be left to the exercise of the discretion of the preliminary inquiry judge. Leave to call evidence to expand, explain or add to the evidence elicited at the preliminary hearing would be an absolute waste of time and money to require duplication of such evidence on the Charter hearing. 2) The applicant sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrants and excluded from trial on the basis that police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the applicant’s residence during the search. Cross-examination will disclose facts to the accused but they will only become admissible at trial by leave of the trial court."
6_2003skqb170.txt,"The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity. The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal. Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.","The appellant was convicted of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. His sentence was suspended with a 1-year probation order. He appealed from the conviction. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1) The court found no error of law or miscarriage of justice. 2) The trial judge erred in law by making findings of fact based on evidence that did not exist; 3) The judge misapplied the test for a defence of necessity and 4) Although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W. (D.) (1991) 1 S.C.R. 742, the trial judge failed to apply the test properly. 3) It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal for a conviction. Had the trial court applied the appropriate test, he may have come to the same conclusion."

I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'. He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them. [5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5. [6] We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access. The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise.

6_2004skpc25.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level. The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'. There was no symbol with it. In the blank that followed was written '5000C'. This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed. The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","The accused is charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The police observed the accused blowing into something that she described as an 'intoxilyzer' at the detachment. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s258(1)(g) for the intended purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol levels. It indicates that the samples were taken at 2:40 and 3:01, with results of 120 and 110 milligramrams, respectively. There is an initialled change to the expression of the year from 19 to 2003. HELD: The accused's charge is dismissed. 1)It is not a requirement of subparagraph 258(2)(g)(i) to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection. The make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out either in the certificate or be proven by other evidence. 2)There is no evidence of the accused’s blood alcohol content. 3)The accused was designated as the modeler of the registered instrument. There was insufficient evidence to establish that her modeler did not adequately or adequately state that the approved Instrument was suitable for the purpose of identifying. 4)The certificate was not properly designated. The modeler was not qualified to make any of the observations necessary to identify the alleged approved instrument. 5)There was no evidence that the accused blew into the object designated for the purposes of identification. 6)The Certificate of Analysis was not designated for this purpose. The certificate may be used to prove facts, not law. The instrument or type of instrument used is matter of fact; whether such an instrument is an approved instrument is a matter of law. 7)The use of a certificate is shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it was intended the contrary to be the case, it would have specifically stated that the authorized instrument needed to be identified, just as it did with respect to the alcohol standard. 8)There were no other circumstances to be considered."
6_2005nsca65.txt,"Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information. The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences. Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered. The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences. If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal.","The Crown appealed the acquittals entered by the Provincial Court judge on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons. The Information alleged that police officers who were in attendance at a residence as a result of a fire were advised by firefighters of two sawed off shotguns in the home. The defence admitted that on May 30, 2003, the resident of the home where the firearms were found, was subject to an order prohibiting possession of firearms and that he was not the holder of an firearms licence. At trial, defence counsel brought a motion for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence of one of the elements of the offence, that is, the date of May 2003, which was an error of law. The trial judge granted the motion because the Crown had failed to prove that the date as alleged in the Information. That was an incorrect of law error. The appeal was allowed and the acquittalals were set aside and a new trial ordered."

The parties have agreed to an order of joint custody with the child residing primarily with the petitioner. The petitioner wishes to move from Saskatoon to Edmonton. HELD: Based on the loss of the respondent as an active co-parent and the petitioner's vague and uncertain plans for the child's care in Edmonton, it is not in the best interests of the child that he be allowed to relocate to Edmonton with the petitioner.","The petitioner and the respondent are the parents of the child. The petitioner separated in October 2003. They agreed to an order of joint custody with the child primarily residing with the respondent. The respondent opposes the petitioner's move to Edmonton. The issues on the proposed relocation are: 1) is it in the best interests of the baby to relocate from Saskatoon to Edmonton; and 2) what is an appropriate access schedule for the child to be with the petitioner. HELD: The respondent is to have joint custody of the Child with the mother. The Court reviewed the factual background in these decisions and found it was not in the children's best interests to allow the petitioner to relocate. Based on the loss of Harley as an active co-parent coupled with Charlene's vague and uncertain plans for the future, what is the best interest of the respondent to relocate to Edmonton? The Court considered the factors that may affect the child's ability to meet his needs. The evidence showed that the respondent would become an access parent and the child would lose the bond he now had with Harley."
6_2007nssc119.txt,"Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies. Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history. There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down. The mother now sought the return of both children. The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect. Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation. Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency. Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately. The mother continued to require professional intervention.","The issue in this case was whether the Agency failed to disclose relevant information to the petitioner and to the court. The petitioner had been apprehended by the Agency and placed in the supervised care of her father, who was now the custodial parent of the three children. Upon L.M.'s application, an ex parte order issued pursuant to the provisions of the Maintenance and Custody Act prevented the petitioner from leaving Cape Breton until further court hearing. The children were placed with the father's common law spouse (C.B.) who was to be the guardian of the children (L.M.). The parties agreed that the child should be returned to Nova Scotia, but the outcome resulted in an out of province courtesy Supervision Order from Cape Town Victoria. The mother, who had been involved in a rocky common law relationship between the parties, wanted the supervision order dismissed as the Agency wanted to assume sole responsibility for K.B. and the children. The father opposed the order, claiming that it would interfere with his child protection history. The sister, who lived with the parents' sister and had child protection histories, claimed that the Agency had made arrangements for her to live with her in a new home. The parents' representative sought to have the information disclosed to the Agency, the court and the court, as well as to the parties' common law partner, who in turn wanted the information to be disclosed. The child protection worker who had previously been employed with the Agency in Sydney confirmed that the agency had already received information from the sister's lawyer regarding the children's placement with the partner. HELD: The court found that the information concerning the partner was simply not germane to the decision made by the agency. The court ordered immediate and intense supervision of the agency, the children and the parents, and ordered the adoption of all three children into the custody of T.B.'s common-law spouse (K.B.). Following the termination of the protection order, the mother was unable to contact the partner and the father had now moved out of the home. There was no evidence of physical or sexual abuse by the partner, nor of any threats to her. There were no credible allegations of sexual or physical abuse allegations. The evidence regarding the partner's history was insufficient to justify the Agency's continued involvement with the children; the evidence concerning the relationship was insufficient; and there were numerous incidents where the partner had committed violent or sexual offences while living with the mother; the Agency acted in breach of its obligations by failing to disclose the information regarding the"

6_2008skca156.txt,"The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","The Crown appealed an order of a Provincial Court Judge declaring that the respondent was unfit to stand trial for offences committed between March 2006 and August 2007. The Crown contended the judge misapprehended the evidence, misstated the evidence and applied the wrong legal test for fitness, applied the incorrect burden of proof and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal allowed. The limited cognitive capacity test (limited cognitive capacity) requires only that an accused be capable of recounting the facts of the alleged crimes and that he must be able to appreciate his own best interest. The 'limited cognitive ability' test strikes an effective balance between the objectives of the fitness rules and the constitutional right of the accused to choose his own defence and to have a trial within a reasonable time. However, adopting a higher threshold for fitness (including 'best interests') derogates from that principle. The respondent had not been convicted in relation to any of the allegations and had not shown that he would always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment."

M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code. After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions. HELD: The accused is sentenced to 9 months incarceration. Pursuant to s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code, a firearm order was made for 10 years prohibiting the accused from possessing any type of weapon. The accused shall also supply a sample of his DNA for analysis. There is an order under s. 490.012(1) that the accused comply with the Sexual Offender Information Registration Act. The accused is also prohibited, pursuant to an order under s. 161(1)(a), from attending a public park or swimming area where persons under the age of 14 years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, day care centre, school ground, playground or community centre for a period of 3 years.","The 37 year old accused was convicted of sexually touching a person under the age of 14 years, contrary to s. 151(1) of the Criminal Code and having contact with an 18-year-old woman for sexual purposes.

The Crown requested an order be made pursuant to ss. 487.012 of the Code prohibiting S.C. from engaging in certain employment involving positions of trust or authority towards persons under 14 years and prohibiting him from attending certain places as provided for by s. 161 of the code. HELD: The sentence was increased to 10 years from the date of his release.  1) This is not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The physical and sexual abuse that he suffered at the hands of his family members have haunted and affected him throughout his life. Failure of the justice system and the courts to protect young people by imposing jail sentences that will serve to denounce and deter abusive behaviour towards children will only perpetuate the kind of abuse and consequences that S.'C. has himself experienced and from which he still suffers. 2) The Court found that the accused was not in a position of trust and authority with regard to his relationship with the woman and that he did not have a duty to follow the example set out in R. v. D.W. (1999) in respecting the principles of denunciation and deterrence."
6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff purchased a country home in 1998. She engaged the services of a defendant realtor who had worked with her for several years as a result of her desire to buy a house. The defendant sold the property in 1999 and had its realtor, Cecilia Mui, take over as realtor in 1999. The realtor then claimed that the house had been moved over 300 kilometres from its original building site and that the defendants had breached the terms of the contract between them. The plaintiff sued the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She alleged that Mui and her company fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property.

6_2010nssc154.txt,"The corporate defendant moved (under Rule 44.10 of the 2008 Rules) for an order terminating an attachment order made against it, and under Rule 32.02(3) to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor. The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","The plaintiff, Sierra Forestry, moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it pursuant to Rule 44.10(b) and to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor. The plaintiff also sought a change of the place of the proceeding, from the current Rule 49.02(1) to more properly reflect the jurisdiction of the plaintiff and its business. The defendants, Sterling Farm and the plaintiff, filed an affidavit in support of the attachment order. The affidavit alleged that action was being taken to migrate the title of several properties owned by Sterling Farm to put the same beyond the reach of its creditors. The defendant argued that this would not lead inevitably to the conclusion that this was being done with intent to hinder or delay the justice system. SGI awarded costs to the applicant of $1,000 payable in any event in the cause.  1) The affidavit did not properly incorporate the contents of the statement of claim. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is not sufficient reason to dispose of the corporate veil.  2) The plaintiff did not establish any of the grounds available under the rules governing attachment orders. It was not satisfied that Sierra had established conduct on the part of Sterling Farm that would hinder any attempt by the plaintiff to resume or expand its operations. 3) There were no other good reasons to terminate the order (e.g. suspicion and supposition) as set out in Rule 49(1)(b). 4) There was no principled basis to justify the maintenance of an attachment ordered. The applicant had established facts, not allegations or suspicions.  5) It was necessary to establish both that there is an attempt to transfer property, and that there are other reasons for termination (the Court could take judicial notice that the existence of a attachment order could be of concern to banks in considering whether to advance financing to the company)."
6_2013nssc256.txt,"Rule 14.01 – Meaning of “relevant” in Part 5 The plaintiff brought a negligence action against the defendant, stemming from a 2007 fire in premises that the defendant had rented from the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought production of documents related to a 2009 fire at another location rented by the defendant. The defendant resisted on the basis that the documents were not relevant. Held, motion dismissed. Under Rule 14.01, the motions judge must decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. The party seeking production must establish relevance. Here, the only evidence was regarding the occurrence of the fires; there was no evidence as to the manner of the defendant's operation of the business in the second location that would establish relevance to the action regarding the first location. The commonality of a fire in separate buildings two years apart does not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating to the second fire.","The defendant operated out of a leased premises in the plaintiff's building two years apart. The building was damaged by a fire in October 2007 and the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant seeking damages, alleging negligence. After the fire the defendant moved to another location. In May of 2009 another fire occurred at the defendant's location resulting in destruction of that building. The defendant moved out of the premises in May of 2013. The plaintiff moved to a new location and in May 2009 another building was destroyed resulting in the destruction of another building. In August of 2013 another fire in separate buildings 2 years apart did not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating to the second fire. The commonality of two buildings 2.5 years apart does not, in itself justify disclosure. The fact that the defendant relocated to another building 2 years ago only served to further support its claim for negligence. To order disclosure of the documents at this stage of the proceedings without further evidence would only serve to sanction a fishing expedition, as stated by Justice LeBlanc in Murphy vs. Lawtons Drugs Stores Limited, 2010 NSSC 289 (CanLII). As a result the motion is dismissed. The court awards costs to the defendant."

In January of 2014, the petitioner filed an application for interim spousal support retroactive to the date of separation. HELD: The petitioner was awarded spousal support, but the award was not retroactive to the date of separation. The petitioner was entitled to spousal support from the date that she put the respondent on notice of her application for spousal support. The respondent, at age 61, should not be forced to work overtime in order to meet his spousal support obligations.

Two health care institutions, one a residential and one a hospital, each of whose employees were represented by a different union, were to be integrated into one new institution, this Centre. HELD: It is within the purview of the Board to interpret s.37 and on an application to quash, the first question to be asked by the reviewing court is whether the interpretation is patently unreasonable. To jump immediately to an analysis of the facts premised on a different interpretation does not serve. The interpretation of the board of s.37 was not patently unreasonable. It does not apply to other areas of the law, such as financing, conveyance of property or insurance, where a more precise and predictable delineation may be appropriate. The Board is interpreting s.37 for the purposes of labour law alone. Appeal Allowed.","This was an appeal from an order setting aside, as premature, an order of the Labour Relations Board directing that a vote be held to determine which of two unions should represent the employees of the applicant. Two health care institutions, one residential lodge and one hospital, each of whose employees were represented by a different union, were to be integrated into one new institution, this Centre. This was undisputed that the long term intent was this integration. The application to the Board, by the appellant C.U.P.E. to determine if it represented a majority of the employees, was made under s. 37 of The Trade Union Act and on an application to quash, the first question to be asked by the reviewing court is whether the interpretation is patently unreasonable. This does not, as noted, apply to other areas of the law, such as financing, conveyance of property or insurance, where a more precise and predictable delineation of the moment of transfer may be appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The transcript evidence was used to emphasize facts which were significant and were not in dispute. 2)There was no evidence that the transcript evidence had occurred at the time of the hearing. 3)The standard of review required the applicant to raise the issue of the current status and degree of review except for the definition of 'impaired by the hearing"", which was not satisfied on the earlier portion of the transcript and the question of the status and extent of review, particularly as set forth in National Corn Growers Assn. v. Canada (Canadian Import Tribunal) (1990), 74 D.L.R. (4th) 449 and the Saskatchewan Appeal File (1993) were used to divide and divide the evidence. 4)The issues which were not dealt with in the decision to grant the order were those which had been raised by the chambers judge and the issues which had not been dealt with by the Board. 5)The Court was of the view that the fundamental question which he failed to answer was whether the Board's interpretation of s.37 was patently unreasonably unreasonable."

7_2010nsca95.txt,"The first defendant was the lessee and driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the plaintiff. The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the plaintiff. The Chambers judge found that there was no real chance of success on the arguments advanced by the respondent respecting Chrysler's alleged liability by operation of the Motor Vehicle Act. The issue was whether the Chambers judge erred in finding that the lease agreement did not fall within s. 2(ak) of the Act and whether Chrysler was vicarious for any negligence attributed to Giffin. The insurer was not a party to the motion. Appeal dismissed.  1) The Court found that s. 248(1) does not apply where the loss or damages occasioned by a collision of motor vehicles are the facts and the appropriate inferences and legal consequences are drawn from those facts. The reverse onus provision simply does not exist. 2) The Chambers decision did not meet the heavy onus on the appellants of clearly demonstrating entitlement to judgment.  3) There was no evidence that the Gold Key Lease was filed or was filed with the Registrar.  4) The issue had no application on the facts of this case.  5) The lease clearly falls into the 'lease with right of purchase' exception to the definition of 'owner.'  6) In a non-employee/employee relationship, the Court could not accept the argument that S. 62 can be applied so as to impose liability in circumstances such as these, where the same factors as those in s. 62 cannot be applied. To suggest that the phrase 'owner' should be read in isolation from the rest of the paragraph and the paragraph which preceded it is too narrow focus.

7_2011nspc27.txt,"The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery. A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","The accused, a young person, was charged with robbery after police stopped a car suspected of being involved in a robbery with a firearm at a specific address in Sackville. The police found the accused in the car minutes after the robbery with the person who had pleaded guilty to the robbery and a gun and number of items reported to have been stolen in the robbery. The gun was found under the back seat of the car loaded. The accused was not asked to implicate the accused directly, but had said that he had been picked up by the police and then put on his finger. The circumstantial evidence at this point is piling up. HELD: 1)The accused was found. He was found in the vehicle with the gun and the brass knuckles and he was in the company of person who has now admitted to having committed the robbery, and he did not have a gun or a ring. 2)The evidence of the accused's involvement would have to be so strong that it would allow the inference to be made that the accused was just wrong. There was no doubt that he was involved with the robbery; it was just plain inconsistent with his guilt, and there was no evidence that he took the responsibility for the robbery himself. It was reasonable to expect that the circumstantials did not support the inference that he either forgot or was not telling the whole truth. 3)There was no other evidence pointing to the possibility that the other accused, K.M., had also pleaded guilty and that he too had a gun. 4)The court was able to conclude that K.'M.'s involvement would only have been so strong as to allow it to be assumed that the person he was standing in front of, who was the mastermind of the three men, had taken the gun from the car and the ring directly in his possession, was in strict compliance with the non-ratting provisions of the code of the street."
7_2011skpc143.txt,"The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals. The issue was whether the claims should be issued. HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","The defendant filed an interim summons requesting the court to issue a supplementary summons. The summons was refused and the plaintiff was sent back to Court to argue the issues. The defendant was not seeking declaratory relief and had not provided any notice to the court. The court had jurisdiction to issue the summons when it was absent from its office. The applicant had submitted 18 Claims for issuing on behalf of the claimants. The issues raised by the claims were important issues to the potential plaintiffs and litigation, in the court's view, must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench, by either issuing a new claim or by enforcement proceedings of the claim upon which the agreement referenced above was made. The claims raised constitutional questions and were vexatious. The Court declined to issue summons as it had jurisdiction under the Small Claims Act to issue such summons."
7_2012skqb338.txt,"Under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules (QBR), the plaintiffs commenced an action in 2009 against the defendant for the return of their deposit and the recovery of their costs for plans with respect to a residential construction contract. The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012. The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew. Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved. This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial? HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act. With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action. As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it. Since the parties had given notice that they wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case, the Court ordered that the deponents be produced for the purpose of cross-examination.","FIAT: The plaintiffs commenced their statement of claim under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Saskatchewan on April 27, 2009. Their claim is with respect to construction contract of purchase and sale. The plaintiffs are claiming the return of their deposit of $25,000 and the costs of plans prepared for them at cost of $3,533.25. The defendant corporation filed a statement of defence on September 17, 2009 denying the plaintiffs claim. In February 2012 counsel for the plaintiffs withdrew and Orion Morgan, president of the defendant corporation, asked for an adjournment of the simplified trial which was granted on May 2, 2012. At that time, Orion Morgan advised the plaintiffs and the Court that his corporation had recently been dissolved. Counsel for the plaintiff then filed a brief of law opposing the Court accepting that affidavit primarily on the basis that it was filed on the eve of trial. At trial, the Court will examine the contents of that affidavit and determine whether it should be considered. HELD: The Court held that based on the basic and fundamental principle of trial fairness, the matter should proceed as if the corporation had not been dissolved and as if it still existed. The dissolved corporate defendant should be allowed to defend the action initiated against it before its dissolution.  1) The Court was aware that there is a case law authority that has found contrary interpretation to similar provisions in other provinces. The Court is not prepared to follow those decisions but to follow other case law that supports the interpretation the Court has made in this case of s. 219 of The Business Corporations Act. 2) In 2012 a conference call was held with the parties at which time a request was made to the trial judge that he be permitted to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the Rules. The trial was to proceed on September 5, 2012 in compliance with the provisions of Part 40 OF the Rules and arrangements are to be made with the Local Registrar."
7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The Court held that it was not satisfied that during the period in question the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had unlawfully harvested forest products and that a fine of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge was an unreasonably low penalty for the offence the court established. The Court appealed the sentence imposed taking the position that a fines of $5,000with a 40 percent surcharge were an unre unreasonable low penalty. The Crown appealed the sentencing. The issues to be decided are whether there was evidence upon which a trier of fact, properly instructed, could reasonably reach the verdict, and whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the learned trial judge's conclusion. HELD: 1) The defendant harvested wood from Crown lands and used it to heat his own home. 2) The evidence of conservation officers was uncontradicted. The defendant sold wood to an undercover officer for $10,000. 3) The statement made by the defendant to Clarke that he obtained his wood through Crown lands was sufficiently ambiguous that the court should not have taken this as an admission, proving beyond areasonable doubt, that the wood comprising the 150 truckloads and 58 truckloads or the three cords sold to him came from Crown land. 4) The Court found there was no evidence of illegal trafficking of forest products on the basis of his negotiations with the officer relating to potential sale of 100 cords. 5) The accused was found not guilty of unlawfully trafficking in forest products. 6) The sentence should have been imposed on the accused who sold wood directly to the undercover officer."
7_2015skqb352.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – Best Interests of ChildFamily Law – Custody and Access – Interim – VariationFamily Law – DivorceFamily Law – Evidence – AffidavitThe parties were in a high-conflict situation and brought five interim applications with various requests. They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","HELD: The Court granted the application. It ordered the child to be registered in the Montessori program and begin attending as soon as the program was able to accommodate such attendance. The cost of that program was set aside and the child was to be enrolled in the program. The Court held that it would be appropriate to have the matter of increasing parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue, even an expedited pre- trial conference. The evidence before the Court was that the parties were in some conflict and that it was necessary for the Court to carefully review the material to determine whether there was a compelling reason to change an interim order. In this case, the child had been in the petitioner's program for one year and was now five days removed from having given birth to the third child. The mother was uncertain as to the plans and the need for a full-time nanny. As a result of the parties' separation, the home was in a state of uncertainty. Construction had not been completed. The new home was nearing completion of construction. As the petitioner was unable to transport the child it became necessary to vary the existing parenting arrangements. In addition, the Court ordered the petitioner to have additional time with the child."

HELD: The application was granted. The court reviewed the pleadings drafted by the self-represented plaintiff and found his claims had no reasonable prospect of success and struck them.,"HELD: SaskTel brought an application seeking an order striking the defendant's Statement of Claim under Rule 7-9(1)(a) of the Queen's Bench Rules on the basis that it discloses no reasonable claim and for an order for costs. SaskTel was awarded its costs. 1) The power to strike out claims that have no reasonable prospect of success is valuable housekeeping measure essential to effective and fair litigation. It unclutters the proceedings, weeding out the hopeless claims and ensuring that those that have some chance of success go on to trial. 2) On an application to strike, the facts set forth in the Statement of claim are considered to be true unless manifestly incapable of proof. It is incumbent on the plaintiff to clearly plead the facts upon which he relies in making his claim. Having reviewed the pleadings carefully, I conclude that Mr. Schutte's claims against SaskTel have no, reasonable prospect, of success and should be struck.  3) SaskTel is awarded costs."
7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in this proceeding is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life Insurance claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the insurer whose lives were insured over the years under the Policy. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be made. HELD: 1) While interpleader relief is appropriate, the appropriate form and nature of additional relief or direction is not immediately apparent. At this stage the competing claims to surpluuses are on the one hand Ag Credit and on the other hand a class of some 6,000 potential claimants. The argument that Ag Credit collected monies from its clients for the purposes of paying their insurance premiums, had a fiduciary duty to do precisely that; the fact that the insurer admits liability for the insurance premiums and that any surplum is the property of the Crown and properly payable to it as the Crown's agent and since no other person has a competing interest to the Ag Credit's right and title is therefore unnecessary. 2) While there is an arguable case that the claims to surplus funds may be of interest to some or all of the insured clients, this case appears to be primarily an interpretative exercise, it is important that the Court have the assistance of counsel advancing the case."

The fact that the respondent brought the vessel into Nova Scotia to perform business for the province rather than travel overseas to purchase aircraft and parts does not send the wrong message. What the law intended to do was to prevent the evasion of tax and consequent loss of revenue by the simple expedient of consumer purchasing goods outside the province. The provision equalizes the burden by taxing out ofprovince purchases by provincial residents at the same rates as if the purchases had taken place in province."

This order was then brought before a Queen's Bench Judge as required by s.5 of the Act for review. The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section. The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered.

It is an extraordinary remedy to be granted only where serious and urgent circumstances indicate a need for prompt action to protect the victim. 2)Absent such urgency, the application should be one for a 'victim's assistance order' brought to a Queen's Bench Judge in Chambers under s.7 in accordance with The Queen's Bench Rules. 3)In this case the domestic violence complained of occurred on January 28. There was no evidence that on February 1, 1995, Dolgopol was at risk of immediate harm. There was by then no element of urgency and the application for relief should have awaited the regular Queen's Bench Family Law Division chamber sittings.  4)The Court commented that it was unclear whether this rehearing was to proceed de novo or as a review but determined that the order should not stand in any event and therefore terminated it forthwith.","FIAT.

The defendant argued that there was sufficient reliable evidence to constitute the reasonable and probable grounds for issuance of the warrant. HELD: The evidence found at the respondent's residence was compelling and the application should have been granted by the authorizing judge. There was sufficient reliability evidence to support the warrant and the Court found that the information to obtain the warrant did not meet the test in R. v. Debot, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140, and therefore the warrant should not have been issued. The applicant also argued that the search was therefore warrantless, breached his Charter s. 8(f) right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and evidence obtained by it should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter of Rights. The reasons for the application were: 1) the informant did not provide reliable information; 2) the police did not seek a warrant on the basis of this information alone, but conducted surveillance, which corroborated the information provided by their sources; and 3) the respondent had not issued a warrant within the meaning of s. 9 of the Criminal Code.

The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement. However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole.

These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant. The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years. The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars. There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years). While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant. There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay. After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here. On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice. There is a significant documentary record of the transactions. The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner. The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time. While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice. Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","The plaintiffs filed an Originating Notice and Statement of Claim in 2000. They claimed that the defendant RBC caused them to suffer losses on investments. They sought to have the action dismissed for want of prosecution on the basis of the delay caused by the defendants' failure to comply with the Rules of the Supreme Court or their acquiescence to the slow pace of litigation. The defendant applied to dismiss the proceeding on the grounds of inordinate delay. Application dismissed; the delay was entirely due to the defendant's solicitor and the plaintiff himself was blameless. The delay was of 8 years and was inordinate. The Court found that given the chronology of events and actions by both sides, the delay is not excusable. It is on the defendant to prove that there has been inordinate and inexcusable delay. The actions of the plaintiffs must be examined on the facts of the case."

The issue that will necessarily drag the proceedings to years is the intended counterclaim by Medusa for as yet undeterminable, possible or potential economic losses allegedly caused by the Respondent's enforcement application. The motion of Medusa was dismissed.  3) The Court considered all of the evidence presented, the applicable Civil Procedure Rules, the jurisprudence referred to and the able and helpful submissions by counsel for the parties and were not satisfied that the initial application could be converted to any action at this time. 4) Rule 7.02 provides a number of other circumstances that could lead to the formation of a separate action for damages.

The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The petitioner was granted interim shared custody with the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support. The petitioner’s petition for division of property, joint custody of Z., specified and supervised parenting time and costs were granted.

The interim agreement provided that the petitioner would have Z. in the interim care of the petitioner and the respondent would have access to his mother. The parties had separated in November 2012. The child was born in December 2012. Throughout the relationship, the petitioner said the respondent had verbally abused the child and had threatened to take it out on him. He denied any contact with the child, claimed that the child was his responsibility, and that he had no money to give him. The evidence showed that the parties followed the interim orders and then ordered an expedited pre-trial conference to have everything put together and sent over before anything else could occur. HELD: 1)The petitioner was concerned that the respondent was holding the child from her and that she was unable to get him to come to her house. She telephoned the respondent the next morning principally to try and get the child back. 2)The respondent was not working and was in constant pain. He refused to take the child to the hospital. 3)All communication went through their lawyers. 4)The parties had been locked out since the December 2012 order. 5)It was clear from the outset that the issues between the parties were not being resolved that a reasonable solution was to have the child live with the petitioner rather than have him move with her to another residence. 6)There was nothing wrong with the basic premise of the petition: that a child should be in the custody of his mother so that she could come pick him up from her house at the appropriate time. The administration of justice was also discussed. 6).The petitioner had no claim to the parenting time of the child. The relationship was fostered by the fact that the two parties had not spoken for some time. There was a significant amount of conflicting affidavit material filed. 7)The evidence was that the father had not been paying child support for the petitioner for the past 3 years. He was using the money he was given to pay the lawyer for the duration of the agreement. The lawyer was not able to contact the child for several days because of the difficulty in reaching the agreed-upon time limit. 8)There were no reasonable"
8_2017skqb249.txt,"HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel had constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The parties entered into three separate contracts in 2008 that each provided that any disputes which could not be resolved by the parties would be settled by binding arbitration. The contracts each provided an implied condition that the parties could appeal an arbitrators' decision based on, among other things, the finality of the arbitrators’ decision. HELD: The application was dismissed. The terms of the agreements, although not specifically referring to a right to appeal on a question of law, contain an implied term that permits the parties to appeal such an decision on a questions of law basis. The meaning of the word 'arbitration' in the agreements set out very clear and well-defined procedures for dispute resolution. It is not akin to the implied term of good faith in contractual negotiation, or the term of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment, but rather an entirely new meaning. The implied term should generally not be implied where it is inconsistent with the express terms of a contract. The questions upon which HAL seeks leave to appealed are questions of mixed fact and law, not pure questions of Law. HOLD: The applications were dismissed.  1)A term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law simply does not fall into the category of the obvious, or something that goes without saying, in the factual matrix of this case. Such an implied word is not equivalent, for instance, to the term good faith or the implied Term of reasonable care in a contract of this nature. Nor is it akin, for example, to an incorrect principle, the failure to consider required element of legal test, or to a contrary intention on the part of either party, which results in a denial of the parties’ right. 2)In this case, the parties referred to one, and only one, specific instance in which an appeal would be permissible. The absence of reference to any other circumstances in which appeal would likely be permitted was intentional. The degree of generality (precedential value) of the agreement, and the order in which the parties prepared their correspondence, the timing and governing law, the information and the governing law (the governing law) were all considered. 3)There is no evidence of the ability of HAL to appeal a decision of the arbitration panel on a case by case basis.

HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed, the sentence appeal was allowed and one year incarceration with a ten year s100 order were imposed. The Crown was correct in characterizing the incident as technically a robbery which was at the low end of the scale of seriousness. What originally would have been a shop-lifting became more serious because of the altercation between the clerk and the appellant.",21 year old appellant was convicted of armed robbery pursuant to ss. 343(d) and 344 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment and a ten year s. 100 order. He tried again to leave the store with some of the submarine sandwiches while holding a pocket-knife. The Crown conceded this was a 'technically robbery' and put the sentence on the low end of the scale of seriousness. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed and a sentence of 1 year incarceration was imposed along with a 10 year section 100 Order. 1)The Crown conceded the incident was technically robbery and that the robbery was at the lower end of that scale. 2)The Court of Appeal was of the view the Crown was correct in characterizing the incident as 'a robbery'. 3)The Conviction Appeal was therefore dismissed and the sentence appeal allowed.
9_1998canlii1737.txt,"The plaintiff paid its municipal property taxes as assessed for three years. On appeal it was held to be entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total amount of $420,000. The plaintiff, pursuant to s. 41(I) of the Judicature Act, sought payment of interest on this amount from the date of the payments. Awarding 5 months interest, that the date from which interest is calculated in this type of action is upon completion of the appeal process. An appropriate interest claim under s. 41(I) therefore only exists for the five month period between the Court of Appeal's assessment determination and the refund of the property tax five months later.","The plaintiff municipal tax payer paid its property taxes as assessed for the years 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 but on appeal was held entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total of $420,177.13.  The plaintiff sought interest pursuant to s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra on the refund from the date it made the overpayments in response to HRM's tax invoices requiring payment of those amounts on the due dates. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld the Utility and Review Board's assessment determination which translated into $420 million overpayment of taxes. HRM paid the refund of overpaid real property taxes to Canada Trust, pursuant to S. 90 of the Assessment Act, and sought an interest rate of 8.75% being a rate equatable to the interest charged by HRM on overdue taxes (prime plus 4.75%). HRM was under a direct mandatory statutory obligation, under s. 90, to refund any amount overpaid as soon as the appeal process concluded. It sought a refund of the overpayment as well as on the unpaid interest until September 7, 1997. The plaintiff appealed the reduced assessment and was awarded a judgment for overpayment. In this action, HRM claimed interest at a rate equal to 5% on the principal amount for the five month period between the Nova Scotia court of appeal assessment determination in March 1997 and the payment of the property tax refund in September 1997 and on unpaid interest from September 6, 1997 to the date of judgment. Canada Trust sought to recover interest on this amount. HELD: 1)The Court found the trial judge found an obligation to refund excess taxes in 1994 but awarded a prejudgment interest back to 1988 for the date when the overpaid health taxes were first remitted. The date when it could be said to be an over payment of taxes does not change or revert back to an earlier date when tax payments were remitted because the appeal effort has concluded. 2)An appropriate interest claim did exist under s./41(i)(i)of the Judicial Act. 3)The court found there was no cause of action for return of any overpaymentof taxes until after the appeal provisions of the assessment had been exhausted. The Court could not bring an action to recover an overpayment when there was a hearing or for recovery of the debt or damages."
9_2000skca87.txt,"An appeal under s.33.1 of the Municipal Board Act from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board, one in a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor (MAF) to assessments for municipal tax purposes. In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed. Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision. The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case. The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.  4)There was no order as to costs as success was divided.","The appellant appealed a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board which held that the use of the MAF to be used in calculating the assessed value of a shopping centre was justified. Appeal allowed on the same basis as those in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon. The issues raised in this case were exactly the same as those dealt with in another judgment, issued concurrently with this one in respect of the assessment of Midtown Plaza in Saskatoon: Cadillac FairVIEW and T. Eaton v. City of Saskatoon; and created as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city of Saskato. HELD: The appeal was allowed on this basis in respect to the 1997 assessment of Market Mall for municipal tax purposes of the shopping centre called Market Mall. 1)There was no error in law. The definition of abnormal functional obsolescence does not appear to apply to an add-on type of construction but rather vintage buildings when design standards were different and building has seen its day. The present method of assessing the common area is reasonable. 2)The issues raised by the appellant in regard to MAF were exactly same as the issues dealt in Cadillac fairview. 3)Each of the issues raised and dealt with was dealt with with in Cadillac. The same reasoning applies in Cadillac and the similar judgment. 4)The appeal must be allowed on a same basis to respect the same grounds of appeal. The ground of appeal to the Committee was unique to this case as it was confined to whether the committee had erred in law by saying that the definition of functional obsolescentence did not apply to either add on type construction or by finding that there must be an inability of an improvement to perform the function for which it is used. The decision was decided on the evidence or lack thereof."

The confrontation between the accused and the complainant was one continuing episodic event and the complainant's actions were provoked by the accused.

The complainant was the boyfriend of another tenant. The parties had been drinking in the basement and had stumbled into a fight in the living room. The accused, who had invited the complainant to join them in the fight, advanced and struck the complainant in the face. HELD: The accused was convicted of assault causing bodily harm. The Court found that the accused could not rely on the Criminal Code s.34(1) for his defence as he did not have the means to do so. The evidence suggested that the complainant had a hostile attitude towards the accused and that he was afraid of the accused. Therefore, the Court concluded that the assault was motivated by a desire to hurt the complainant and not by any other reason."

There were four grounds of appeal: 1) an application to admit new evidence on appeal; 2) a constitutional challenge seeking a declaration that the bylaw was ultra vires for uncertainty; 3) the significance of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw; and 4) the meaning of the word 'livestock' in the bylaw. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) New evidence will not be admitted on an appeal if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial. Further, new evidence will be admitted only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial. Neither of these requirements is met. 2) The constitutional challenge is not properly before the Court as notice is required when the constitutionality of a bylaw is impugned. In any event, the uncertainty on which the appellants rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist. 3) The appellants misunderstand the use of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw. 4) Whatever definition of 'livestock' is used, the definition always includes cattle.","At a June 2, 2006 trial in Provincial Court, the appellants were found guilty of breaching a bylaw of the Rural Municipality of Vanscoy No.345. The trial justice convicted them of breaching Bylaw 2-1995, which provides that no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned hamlet. The appellants did not lead evidence at trial. They did not dispute that they were keeping cattle on their property. Their defence related to points of law. HELD: The application to admit new evidence was dismissed. 1)The appellants had not given notice under the Constitutional Questions Act. Notice is required when the constitutionality of bylaw is questioned. 2)The uncertainty suggested by these appellants does not exist. Under the no livestock policy no livestock is permitted in the district. Cattle are livestock, and so cattle are not permitted in that district. The three bylaws tendered by the appellans do not bear upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue at the trial. The amendments to the zoning bylaw do not relate to any issue in this matter. The letter from Saskatchewan Government Relations and Aboriginal Affairs did not bear on a decisive issue. The references to proposed amendments in the letter would not establish that there had been any amendments. The proposed amendments relate to the basic planning statement, not to the bylaw under which the appellant were convicted. 3)There was no basis on the trial decision as to how anyone can know what 'livestock' is, within the meaning of the Bylaw. The uncertainty suggested that the word is uncertain and that it can be defined so broadly as to be either meaningless or unenforceable. 4)Application to admit a new evidence dismissed. 5)The evidence that had come into the possession of the appellant after the trial and that they had admitted were not properly before me. Notice was required under the CQA to review documents tendered for admission. 6)The respondents did not provide any necessary due diligence.

The plaintiff brought an application for mandamus to compel the defendant to hold a new hearing and filed two affidavits providing some detail and background information as to its reasoning for its failure to attend the hearing and the parties' differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan. The defendant brought an application to strike certain of the affidavits filed by the plaintiff on the basis that they were an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not forming part of the record. Application to strike affidavits dismissed; the Rules do not preclude the admission of affidavits on an application and, in the present circumstances, reason and fairness militated against ruling the affidavits inadmissible.

The applicant also sought to have two affidavits struck as being attempts to put the evidence into evidence on matters that were not in the Record. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The affidavits filed by the applicants were found not to be admissible. 2)The Court had an inherent jurisdiction to control all inferior tribunals, not in an appellate capacity but in a supervisory capacity, and its control extends not only to seeing that the inferior tribulations keep within their jurisdiction, but also to observing the law. The control is exercised by means of power to quash any determination by the tribunal, which on the face of it, offends the law and is therefore inappropriate and contrary to case precedent. 3)The affidavit evidence was admissible but was not admissible on an application for certiorari. 4)The applicant failed to show that the record was incomplete, that the conviction omitted the evidence of one of the witnesses, or that the applicant could not be paid the money to which he was entitled. 5)There must be an ongoing and clear dispute with respect to the authority of the Board to suspend and deal with various natural products and the authority it has delegated to the various boards it is charged with overseeing the production and operation of those natural products.

The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother.

The father was directed to perfect his appeal and the stay of proceedings arising from Court of Appeal Rule 15(4) was also lifted.","The applicant mother sought a lifting of the stay of execution on the judgment of the trial judge pursuant to s. 8(a)(i) of The Children's Law Act. HELD: The application was granted and the stay was lifted in accordance with the factors set out in s.8(a) of the Act. The court found that it would be in the child's best interests to lift the stay on the basis of the evidence as to the father's lack of involvement with the mother and his seeming inability to facilitate access to his mother and sister, especially where access had been ordered by the court, that the lifting of this stay would allow the child to settle into routine and schedule during the school year.

b_1997canlii11375.txt,"The plaintiff, a specialty seed marketing company, claimed damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. Johnson Seeds entered contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting to secure product for resale. After extended negotiations the defendant eventually signed and mailed the standard form contract but never received an executed copy. The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993. The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price. HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action. 1)There was a valid contract between the parties. Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract. 2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract. The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone. There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94. The formal contract did not expressly set forth these conditions. Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.  4)Farr took a calculated risk and sold the seed which alleviated his immediate cash-flow problem. Johnson Seeds waited until the last possible day under the written contract terms to call the contract in an effort to position itself to claim increased damages for breach of contract.","The plaintiff Seeds sought damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. The plaintiff entered into a verbal contract with the defendant that required the defendant to pay 10 per pound on the first day of seeding. The contract was not executed but the defendant knew at the time that it would be done. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $50,000.00 in damages. 1)The plaintiff did not receive an executed copy of the contract. In fact, the defendant never received a fully executed copy. The post office was a legitimate agent of Johnson Seeds for the purpose of communicating the acceptance of the offer and the letterhead indicated that it was the price the plaintiff wanted to receive. 2)The defendant knew that the plaintiff had a contract with Johnson Seeds and he made calculated risk by selling the canary seed. He took calculated risk and sold the seed. 3)Although it may have been in the reasonable contemplation of the plaintiff that he would receive back a fully- executed copy, there was no doubt that in the telephone conversations he had with the producer he confirmed that a contract had been executed. The defendant confirmed that such a contract did exist. 4)In the instant case, the plaintiff received a copy of a letter signed by the defendant in November and December 1993 and at the post office in December 1993 it was confirmed that the contract was valid. 5)In addition to the fax and the telegraph, Johnson Seeds retained a fully copy of its contract on their file. The copy was never sent to the plaintiff.  6)It is impossible to say that the defendant verbally confirmed that he had signed the contract and that the terms of the document were identical. 7)It would be unfair to deprive the plaintiff of the opportunity to redeem the contract for a better price than what it paid in 1993. 8)It was unnecessary for the plaintiff to insist that the term in the contract had to be expressly stated."
b_1999canlii13927.txt,"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the Court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial in the trial proper and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so, and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)It is in the interest of conducting an orderly trial that the trial judge is entitled to insist and should insist that defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial. All issues of notice to the Crown and sufficiency of disclosure can be sorted out at that time.  2)This can quite properly occur by the application of some or all of the evidence which is already before the court and on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of that evidence can be reserved pending the determination of the Charter issue on its merits and the application for s.24 remedy, if any. 3)The application to exclude evidence will be brought by the accused, and the Crown will have the onus of demonstrating on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled, on a review of the substantive issue on the merits, to assert entitlement at the earliest possible point of trial. In such circumstances, the court would not suggest that the Crown examine the witnesses-in-chief, first, and then the defence cross-examine them. In light of these observations, and what has been said in the cases, one cannot see any justification for the procedure presently proposed. In Provincial Court it will be for the court to decide what procedure should be followed, but at least, counsel should give timely notice to Crown counsel of the charter issue, and at trial, counsel for the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which an application for exclusion is made. There is not in the common sense proposition that objections to admissiblilty of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered. In this sense, it follows that in a Provincial Court trial there will be instances where the defence can't afford to sit back and hope that something will emerge from the Crown's case to create a Charter argument or assist in one counsel is already prepared to make. This is where fairness requires that the accused be"
b_2002nspc32.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit and impaired driving. After being involved in an accident, the accused was taken to hospital where a blood demand was given and eventually acceded to. The accused challenged the validity of the blood demand and argued that his right to counsel was violated. Accused guilty of operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit; there was no violation of the accused's right to counsel. The officer had valid grounds to make the demand, having been advised that the accused was in an accident, that someone had said the accused was either high or intoxicated, having smelled a mild odour of alcohol on the accused and the accused having advised him that he only had three beer. Even if the accused's claim to amnesia for all the events around that time was believed, there was no medical evidence to suggest that he could not understand what the officer said to him at the hospital. Although his degree of alertness may have fluctuated, he displayed an understanding of the situation by showing appropriate concern for how much he had been drinking and asking questions which showed an understanding of his situation and what speaking to counsel would entail.","The defendant was charged under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code with operating a motor vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit. The Court found that the accused had sufficient understanding of the circumstances surrounding his offence and that his condition at the time of the incident was such that if the accused did not understand his right to counsel when informed of the blood demand, the onus has to be on him to prove that he asked for the right but it was denied or denied any opportunity to even ask for it. HELD: The accused was granted s. 10(v) Charter rights at time when he was capable of appreciating and understanding the rights and that the evidence showed that he appreciated and appreciated the rights.  1) The accused demonstrated an understanding of his situation through words and actions spanning a significant period of time.  2) His level of alertness may have been fluctuating but he nevertheless displayed an understanding through actions and words that span a significant time. 3) The Court discounted the weight of the accused's evidence considerably as it relates to his ability to comprehend events at the hospital.  4) There is no evidence of mechanical defects or failures in the defendant's vehicle. The medical technician at the RCMP Forensic Laboratory testified that he could smell liquor on the defendant’s breath and he thought the driver had hit the gravel on the shoulder of the road and then lost control of the vehicle. 5) There was no other evidence from medical personnel at the scene.  6) The medical evidence showed the defendant had only had three beer in the brief time he was in the hospital and no observations regarding the smell of alcohol. 7) The officer was aware of poor road conditions, weather conditions, or any unusual hazards that might contribute to an accident of this sort. The accused had been in the vehicle for only 1:00 before it hit the shoulder and left the road. 8) The evidence tends to show that the drinking took place throughout that one-half hour period. 9) The Certificate of Qualified Medical Practitioner and certificate of an analyst were awarded to the accused for valuing the evidence. 10) Although the accused’S physical condition may have affected his assessment of his rights at the outset, his statements and actions during the relevant time period gave him an honest and reasonable understanding of what was going on.  10) The information in the possession of the police officer gave him a valid waiver and the accused understood that he was required to prove the following things: 1) the breath and the three"
b_2002skpc50.txt,"An application for a DNA warrant on the basis s.487.05 (the general warrant provision) of the Criminal Code with respect to DNA warrants does not refer to a form. The applicant suggested a tape recording would avoid the potential problems in bringing the application before a Provincial Court Judge. HELD: These concerns were raised in the January 21 decision concerning potential prejudicial or negative effects, which outweigh any requirement to swear the Information before a judge. An oath taken before a commissioner or notary is as valid as it is before a provincial court judge and avoids all the possible problems that relate to personal attendance. The intention is to make protocol work as flexible as possible, not impeding the police in their legitimate role, while making sure the court maintains its independence. Form 5.01 is specifically set out in the Code. Section 487.1 does not have a form, but even if it did and used the same words 'taken before me', that would elevate form over substance in a significant way.","The applicant Provincial Court Judge swore the Information to Obtain a search warrant. The applicant had applied under Provincial Court Rule 487.1 which required that the Information be sworn before the Provincial Court judge. The judge had refused on the grounds of personal attendance that it would result in prejudicial or negative effects of a personal attendance before the judge. Granting the application, that the officer was allowed to swear the Information on the application. The court reviewed the procedure for this application and found that personal attendance is not the issue here. It seems to me that the better practice is to put as much as you can in the Information and to use it in the manner prescribed by the Code. This is not a practical issue to deal with in an ordinary warrant application."
b_2006nssc221.txt,"Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement. Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The applicant applied to vary spousal support provisions of the Corollary Relief Judgment. Although the parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation, the divorce settlement and the agreement incorporated the terms of the parties' settlement of the property division issue, the applicant had previously obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1992 and her Masters in 1994. The respondent moved from the matrimonial home and was divorced in February 2003. The parties exchanged financial disclosure and provided the court with their affidavits and financial statements and both counsel were given the opportunity to cross-examine the opposing parties. Application allowed; the onus is on the applicant to satisfy the Court that the Agreement was not in substantial compliance with the objectives of the Divorce Act and that the Respondent did not take advantage of any vulnerability of the applicant. Although both parties were expecting retirement and were trying to avoid the necessity of future court proceedings, the Agreement provided for an approximately equal division of assets and debts. The rental income from the sale of a home and a bank account was double the amount paid by the respondent. The Respondent assumed responsibility for the mortgage and the student loans, a significant portion of which were borne by the applicant as part of her university education and a significant sum of money borrowed on line of credit, using her home as security and to purchase mutual funds as an investment. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The Agreement was sound when it was signed and there have been no changes in circumstances since it was executed. There was no pressure exerted upon the applicant and no oppression during the course of the negotiations or the signing of the Agreement and the rental income more than covers the mortgage payment. 2)There was no evidence of coersion or anything of that nature. The Agreement was voluntary. The applicant had the assistance of very experienced counsel and financial advice. The court was able to take into account a number of factors including the respondent's age, his health and his reasonable expectation of retirement. 3)There had been no material change in the circumstances of either party. The Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and should not be relied upon lightly. There were no errors by either party in the negotiations. 4)The agreement was binding and the applicant was bound by its objectives. 5)The applicant was awarded a lump sum of $1,535.00 for the costs of preparing the report and preparing the judgment and the application for variation. 6)Costs were met."
b_2007nsca75.txt,"A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway. When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed. Appeal dismissed. At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit. It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit. Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.","The defendant was charged with second degree murder and was tried in the Court of Appeal's chambers on the ground that the defendant's affidavit was inadmissible. The chambers judge found that the plaintiff had met the burden placed upon him in the application for summary judgment and dismissed the application. The issues on appeal were whether the chambers judge erred in his application, whether the judge properly considered the affidavit, whether there was a genuine issue of fact requiring trial, and whether the plaintiff met the onus of showing that there was no such issue. HELD: The summary judgment application was dismissed with costs. 1)The affidavit was severely deficient and did not comply with the law in Nova Scotia respecting the form and contents of affidavits. 2)The affidavits of the defendant and the plaintiffs were appended to the exhibit set out in the motion. 3)The chambers judge did not refer at all to the real chance of success test. The affidavit was properly vetted and accepted by the court. 4)The court was bound by the decision of the Chamber of Commerce which held that the requirement for leave to appeal an interlocutory order is found in Judicature Act s.60.11. The test was well established and has been proven in Milbury v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), 2007 NSCA 52 (Q.L.) (NSCA). 5)The Court was able to distinguish between the two parts of the test and found that, in the case of the second step, there was at least a genuine issues of fact, which should be left to the trial judge to decide the application on the merits."
b_2010nssc125.txt,"The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","The plaintiff's employer suspended him from work without pay following the laying of criminal charges. They offered, however at their expense, the use of their legal counsel to defend the plaintiff. The plaintiff objected to the admission of the video re-enactment and the still photographs, as well as the opinions given by the RCMP Traffic Analyst regarding the amount of time that someone would have had to see the Chrysler and stop their vehicle. At trial, the plaintiff argued that the Crown's theory of the accident was fatally flawed and that its evidence should not have been introduced by the Crown, nor should counsel have referred to the theory in summation. Defence counsel should have raised a timely objection. The court found that the context of the manner in which the video was used at trial was one of factors that led it to conclude that the expert's opinion, although not admitted into evidence, was not properly considered at the time of trial and constituted breach of the appropriate standard of care."
b_2010skqb343.txt,"A class action was certificated at Queen's Bench on the basis of breaches of The Consumer Protection Act and a breach of duty of care. The defendants were granted leave from the Court of Appeal to appeal the portion of the certification order dealing with alleged breaches of The Consumer Protection Act only. The certification on the basis of duty of care was upheld. As a result, a situation existed where the class action process could continue on only part of the claim until the appeal of consumer protection act issues was heard. HELD: Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules is engaged and the entire certification judgment is stayed pending the disposition of the appeal. If the plaintiffs wish to apply to lift the stay they must do so to a judge of the Court of Appeal.","The defendants sought leave to appeal the certification order of the Consumer Protection Act (CPA) pursuant to s. 39(3)(a) of the Class Actions Act. They applied to leave the matter to proceed concurrently with the appeal on the CPA cause of action. A conference call was convened to address the issue of the next steps that should be taken. A decision on the leave application was rendered on August 26, 2010 and the matter was moved to a later stage of the conference call. The conference call convened in September 2010 at which time the parties were given the opportunity to speak to the topic of whether it was appropriate to move the matter forward at this time given that there is an appeal pending on only one aspect of the certification certificate. The plaintiffs sought to stay the action on the basis of an interlocutory decision. HELD: 1)Leave was granted to appeal. Steps can now be taken to move this matter forward concurrently with or on the appeal of the CACA certification order. Steps were granted to proceed on the remaining issues of the leave petition. 2)The situation was that the class action would definitely advance, although until after the appeal concerning the CAA cause of Action is finally determined, it is not known whether the class actions will proceed on a basis of one cause of actions or two. Steps could be taken at this stage given the current situation. Steps had been granted in relation to the breach of the duty of care cause, but steps were still pending on the entire CPA certificate. 3)The plaintiffs sought leave on the sole portion of the portion of that certification order that pertained to alleged breaches of the CFP Act relating to alleged breach of of duty. All other aspects were dismissed."
b_2011skpc30.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care and control of a motor vehicle and care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.","The accused was charged with two counts being driving over.08 contrary to s. 253 of the Criminal Code and one count being impaired by alcohol. The accused was granted leave to cross-examine on the information to obtain blood samples as a condition of being free from unreasonable search and seizure. The issues before the court were whether the Information to Obtain Blood samples contained sufficient grounds to warrant a search warrant, whether the information contained in the information was a reasonable grounds for the belief that the accused had committed an offence under s.253, and whether the Certificate of Analyst and the report were evidence of probative value. HELD: 1) The information was not sufficient to establish on a balance of probabilities that the warrant to seize the accused's blood would be invalid. 2) The officer did not depose that he believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle. The information to disclose did not include the source of his belief in the driver's belief that Francis was the only occupant in the vehicle and the rest of his body was slumped across the passenger's seat. 3) The warrant to search for blood was invalid. 4) The accused's s. 8 rights were breached. 5) The Court reviewed the whole of the material presented and determined that the officer had failed to provide sufficient detail in the document to permit the Justice of the Peace to determine that reasonable grounds exist for the warrant. The officer's testimony during the voir dire was not supported by the material contained therein.  6) The evidence heard at trial was not a technical error and was not fatal to the warrant, but rather a breach of the accused’s s.8 rights. The Certificate of Analysis was not included in the evidence. 7) The Information totain did not contain any details of the accident except for the fact that the sole occupant was unconscious. 8) There were witnesses at the scene of the crash. 9) There was a relatively narrow basis for exclusion as the officer failed to communicate the basic information required of a warrant to be issued. 10) Finally, there was a high standard of review in R. v. Garafoli (1993), [1993] S.C.R. 607 (the Supreme Court of Canada) which established that a warrant may be issued for blood samples obtained in a manner that infringed or violated a person’S s.7 Charter right. 11) The defendant was granted reasonable grounds to believe that the person he was photographing, operating the vehicle at the time of the collision, that Francis had been"
b_2016skqb297.txt,"HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made. The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.",HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that were not addressed that: 1) the petitioner had not established that there was a risk of harm based upon her allegations that the respondent had anger management problems that made her and their daughters fearful of him and addictions to pornography and masturbation that made it impossible for them to continue to reside in the same home; and 2) that the petitioner's allegations were not statements of fact. The evidence did not support the conclusion that increased contact between the respondent and the children would in fact be beneficial. The Court also concluded that the absence of such evidence would result in an artificial relationship between the parties and that increased access would in the best interests of the children. The harm test was not accepted.

The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application. Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court, that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation. The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances. Accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to vary awards of lump sum child support made pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Family Court, which held that a lump sum payment made under the Family Maintenance Act could not be varied after payment.

A custody investigation conducted in 1990 when the mother had first commenced this application had recommended that the existing arrangement be continued. The Father now intended, however, to move with the children to Ontario to take additional education. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Judge found that the move to Ontario was a sufficient change of circumstances to permit a variation application to proceed. She therefore proceeded to consider if the move was in the best interests of the children. 2)The Judge reviewed recent authorities from across Canada dealing with whether a custodial parent should be permitted to move with the children. 3)In the circumstances of this case the Judge was convinced that the move was reasonable and was not motivated by any desire on the part of the Father to thwart the Mother's access.","An application for variation of the January 1990 judgment, which gave judgment for divorce and joint custody to the parents of two boys born April 22, 1984 and June 3, 1986.

The father applied to vary the judgment in 1990 claiming joint custody, residence with the mother and generous access to the father.

The court found that the mother's reasons for moving were not unreasonable if the course he wished to take was not offered at the Dental College of the University of Saskatchewan. 2)The father was granted generous access. The circumstances now appeared to be that he wanted to take the boys to live with his new wife, rather than the mother. 3)There was no dispute that the father had, together with his present wife, the day to day care of the children from their early years onward, except when they were exercising the access to mother. 4)The fact that existing custodial arrangements showed that the best interests of the child lie with the them being with the custodial parent and that the move would not be in the best interest of the boys if the sole custody was granted to the mother or a joint custody order was made with respect to access in the province. 5)It was reasonable to expect that an incident of custody included the determination by the custodian parent of where the parent and child shall live and provisions for possible access in Hawaii if the move was necessary.

When his federal government management position was declared redundant, the applicant received a retiring allowance of $75,646 in May 1997. The respondent opposed the application on the basis there had been no change in circumstances since the judgment was granted; she had no other income than the support payments and child tax credit; alternatively, there were special provisions in the parties' separation agreement which would permit the court to award an amount that differs from the amount prescribed by the Guidelines.HELD: 1)The judgment the applicant sought to vary was made after the coming into force of the Guidelines. It did not however include a determination of child support made in accordance with the Guidelines. There was no change in the childrens' or mother's circumstances.

She was also ordered to repay any outstanding mortgage debt of $19,000 which had been paid by the parties in the interim order made in June 1996. 3)The parties agreed to a'special provision' of $20,000, which the husband was not obliged to repay other than for the payment of RRSPs. 4)No order as to costs."
c_1999skqb178.txt,"Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute. The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in the proceeding, there were also questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial. HELD: The tapes were admitted to their entirety and the court found them to have the opposite effect. They spoke volumes about the father's character and motivations while shedding little light on the mother. The tapes had the opposite affect. They speak volumes about what the father’s character, motivations and psychological well-being were based on. They shed little light upon the mother’ s.  Condition was granted to the father on the condition that they went in unedited."

The first language of the respondent mother and the child is Inuktitut. The child, born in 1993, lived with the mother in Nunavut until 1999, when he moved to Nova Scotia to be with the father by agreement of both parties. This arrangement was not to exceed one year unless agreed to by the mother. Determining that the courts in both Nunavut and Nova Scotia have jurisdiction to deal with the issue of custody, that it was in the best interests of the child to remain in Nova Scotia and for the custody hearing to be held in Nova Scotia.","This was an application for custody of the child. The mother had been unable to obtain a translator in Nova Scotia and had spent considerable time trying to contact the father. The father had recently moved away from Nunavut and had difficulty obtaining a translator. The child had been in the mother's home all the time and was doing well in school. An order issued in November 1999 confirming the mother was not giving up her parental rights, ordered that the child be sent to Nova Scotia to live with his father and that an interim agreement be agreed to for a period of time to allow for the adoption of a new child. Counsel for the father called a number of witnesses and testified to some of the difficulties the mother had had in finding a permanent place to live. Awarding custody to the father, who can provide the financial and environmental factors more satisfactorily while the mother has the cultural aspects such as an Inuit extended family and physical environment to enhance this and the Inuktitut language, was in the best interests of the young child."

The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused. The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand to provide a sample of his breath by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to enable proper analysis of my breath to be made by means of an approved screening device. The accused argued that the 'ride along' had no duties and was simply with the accused. He chose not to disclose in his disclosure information the name of theride along nor even that there was a ride along. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The accused's testimony was preferred over that of the officer. 2)The officer's lack of cander in giving his testimony raised doubts in the mind as to his forthrightness in respect to other important details in this matter.  3)The evidence of the accused who argued that he was not intentionally trying to avoid providing an adequate sample was accepted. He was attempting to supply sample as directed by the officer and to provide adequate sample instructions to the officer so that he could get an adequate Sample. The officer did not understand why the accused was not getting a proper sample. 4)The mental element of the offence of refusal created by s.254(5) of The Code consists of intentional non-compliance. The police officer was not trying to evade providing an inadequate sample. The only reason he was asked to provide sample was because he was having three beers the whole night. The last call came when they were at the pines just north of Prince Albert. The second test was performed as directed. The first time the accused blew outside the mouthpiece of the vehicle. He blew three times in all. The vehicle swerved to the right-hand side of the highway more than necessary as he approached it. The officers had to engage the emergency lights on the vehicle and he stopped the vehicle to check the driver's license and registration. The next time the officer engaged his emergency lights he was driving at an excessive speed and was in the middle of nowhere. He did not provide any instructions as to what to do with the sample.

Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review. The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt. It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence.","A cocaine fuelled encounter between the appellant and the woman with whom he was living resulted in his conviction for assault and sexual assault. He appealed the conviction submitting that it was unreasonable, was based on misapplication of the burden of proof and that the judge's reasons were so deficient as to constitute an error of law. The appeal was dismissed as there was ample evidence which supported the conviction.

Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with the exception that the wife is to be given immediate access to her personal belongings; both applications to introduce fresh evidence dismissed; on the sparse record before him, the trial judge did not err in his division of assets and did not offer the husband unwarranted assistance as a self- represented litigant. Faced with two competing claims as to the amount of the proceeds of sale, if any, of one of the parties' properties, the trial judge committed no error in finding the amount owed to be half-way between the two claims and then setting it off against the amount owed to the other party.","The parties were married for four years and had two children. The wife sought a more favourable division of assets and an entitlement to health insurance. The husband sought to have the matrimonial home divided into two equal parts: a camp property and an adjoining 100 acre lot. The parties separated in 2001. The primary contest related to the disposition of the 'camp property' and its value. The trial judge found that the value of the assets retained by the wife exceeded those retained by husband; this resulted in credit to the husband for the home purchase and the sale of the adjacent property. The judge found no palpable or overriding error in this regard. The evidence, if available, should have been rendered at trial. There was no basis for the Court to exercise de novo trial functions for the consideration of evidence which was available for the trial."
c_2005nsca7.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. Both parties appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract. The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation. Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","The plaintiff brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misstatement. It claimed that the defendant had negligently estimated the quantities of coal to be handled under the contract and, as a result, induced the plaintiff to enter a contract from which it was unable to derive anticipated profits and operating losses. The defendant also alleged various breaches of contract including wrongful termination. The plaintiff appealed. Appeal dismissed; the plaintiff's claim for damages for negligent misrepresentation was dismissed; defendant's appeal dismissed. Although the plaintiff failed to provide the approximate tonnages sought in the tender and the defendant's breach was not proven, the trial judge made an error in understanding the contractual obligations of the plaintiff and found that the plaintiff could not rely on the exclusion of liability clause relating to its estimates."

The defendant applied to strike the pleadings, for summary judgement and for costs and disbursements. The originating notice action was filed July 21, 2003 and therefore the new tariff of September 29, 2004 does not apply. The plaintiff filed a notice action in July 2004 and therefore, the old tariff does notapply. In many applications where the results bring finality the court has utilized Tariff A. The sale price of the property which was approximately $2,000,000 was not, in the view, the appropriate amount involved. The hearing was less than 2 hours in duration and there were a number of steps taken prior to the application including filing a list of documents, exchange of documents and apparently two days of discovery. The defendants made an offer of settlement in the amount of $5,000 inclusive of costs, which take to be an attempt to have the action simply go away due to the heavy costs of litigation. However, the sale price in this application was not the appropriateamount involved and it was very difficult and in fact impossible for the court to really get a handle on what amount of loss of profits was being pursued or to what extent the plaintiff were monetarily at risk.

At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment. It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her. In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal. Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.  2) The contract of employment was a term contract extending from May to August 31, 2004. The plaintiff was dismissed on July 12. But for her dismissal, she would have worked for the rest of July and for the month of August or 36 days. 3) In this case the plaintiff made reasonable effort to seek and maintain employment.

The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions. The plaintiff is a councillor. The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act. There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council. The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions.

While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council. The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents.

This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care.

The defendant is not liable to the applicant pursuant to the tort of misfeasance in public office.  1)The dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant was a political one.

c_2006skqb335.txt,"FIAT: The former vice-president of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan. He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour. He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application. Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart. It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart. The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart. HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed. The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.  1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit. This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility. The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents. 2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents. There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.  3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart. Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations. Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart. However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them. Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias. To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy. That is not good enough.","FIAT. Wal-Mart brought three applications. The first motion was brought by the applicant Wal-mart Canada Corp. which sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and Rule 673 prohibiting the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board as presently constituted from hearing and/or making any orders involving Wal-Marts. The second motion by the union applied for an order striking and removing virtually all of the material filed in support of the application by Wal- Mart. In the other motion the Union applied for a order striking virtually all the material and making an order dismissing Wal-marts' motion. Wal Wal- mart argued that the actions of the Unions, the interference by the Government and the presence of certain publications demonstrate that the SRB is biased or, at the very least, there is a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal-WalMart. HELD: The relief sought by the Union should be granted and the application brought by Walmart should be dismissed. Although there is no admissible evidence before the court, the Store Manager's account is accurate and Wal Wal Mart's application to strike or to strike portions of several of the materials filed by the plaintiff was dismissed. 1) There is no necessity for their admission. The applicant must be available to swear an affidavit. The critical allegations originate with him. Absent any explanation for his absence, there was no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proferred documents as evidence. At no time have the allegations been tested for accuracy and truthfulness. In reality, contradictions are found within the very documents. 2) The affidavits of the union members filed in opposition to the application were admissible. The statements of claim in Walter Matkowski v. Government of Saskatchewan et al. filed in Saskatoon are admissible but, in the circumstances, are not to be admitted into evidence on the basis of necessity and reliability. 3) The statements in the articles of record filed by Wal Mart are admissible. There is nothing more under oath. Since everything attributed to the Matkowski has an aura of self-interest, it does not generate confidence in its reliability. The truth will not be known until there has been a trial."

Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make.

The amendment will not interfere with the date set for filing the appeal book or result in any wasted effort to address the appeal as originally framed. As, in the sense relevant to this application, the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice. Leave to amend is granted on the condition that the appeal be filed on or before January 15, 2007. The parties' arguments in opposition to the amendment relate to the merits of the point raised by it. HELD: Leave was granted. 1)The amendment was reasonably necessary to the presentation and will do not occasion any prejudice. The argument in opposition was not the only ground of appeal advanced by way of amendment as it was not limited to the points raised by the ground. 2)Leave to amend was granted in the cause. Leave must be reserved for the parties' submission of the issues at the hearing. 3)Leave was not required to rule on the substantive merit of the arguments. The arguments were for the panel and, therefore, not chambers judges to consider; and 4)The arguments were not for a chamber judge to decide. The panel did not have to rule in the issues advanced by them."

She had completed her studies to become a teacher 13 years ago and had erroneously been advised that a consumer proposal would discharge these loans. Although both she and her husband had good incomes, it would still take several more years to discharge the loans without prejudicing her family's reasonably frugal lifestyle. Relief granted; to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties. The bankrupt had acted in good faith and had been unable to service the loans in the early years when she did not have permanent employment. Compromising the debt and requiring her to only pay half of it was not an available option.","The Bankrupt, who had outstanding student loans of about $39,000, applied for relief under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. She had applied for interest relief in the amount of $2,000.00. Although she had good income, it would still take several years to discharge the loans without prejudicing the reasonable frugal lifestyle she and her family enjoy. To expect them to pay in a shorter period would be a continuation of financial difficulty which prevented her from paying the loans. Any period longer would be too long. It would also protract the burden of these loans in a manner inconsistent with the overall objectives of the BIA."
c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accused’s stepmother had called the accused prior to the search of their home and the accused was charged with possession of a prohibited firearm. The evidence at trial had revealed that the accused had constructive and/or joint possession of the firearms at the home with the accused. At issue was the validity of the Crown”s s. 8 Charter application and whether the accused could assert a privacy interest in order to obtain protection of s.8 of the Charter and then, when that application went badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1) The evidence led by the Crown had established that the phone with the number 229-4400 was the accused“s. 8”. 2) The accused had not obtained a Part VI authorization to possess firearms and ammunition. The intercepts were also of significant importance to the firearms trafficking charges. 3) There was nothing to suggest that the guns and ammunition introduced as evidence in this trial were not the ones located in the deceased” s. 2 home.  4) The Crown had not resorted to evidence of reasonable expectation of privacy in the Samsung cell phone in determining the phone was his. 5) The Court was unable to accept that the guilty pleas of the accused were relevant to the issue of the criminal liability on the firearms possession charges. They did not associate him with the phone and it entitles him at trial to demand that the Crown prove the phone is his."

The defendant appealed asking if the plaintiff was prepared to do only portion of the seeding and to'seed along side us'. HELD: Leave to appeal was denied. 1)Leave to appeal should not be granted to the defendant company. 2)The trial judge did nothing improper in this regard.

As a person who was given a grant in probate, he is obligated to carry out the directions contained in the Will. By making the application he has effectively stating that he is not prepared to give effect to those directions. The affidavit evidence satisfies the Court that this is something that Evan will not do.  3) The court ordered the respondent to be removed as a executor."
d_1990canlii4118.txt,"In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice. The plaintiff had correctly interpreted the clause as relating to the termination of the agreement, not of his employment. The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta. The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months. He was also awarded the loss resulting from the difference in vacation and loss of an auto allowance for the 15 months. For emotional trauma, which lasted only briefly, he received $500.","This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff was assigned to work for the defendant company as an expatriate for four years. He received a salary of $60,000. In return, the defendant offered him a position in the private sector, which he refused, saying he had a number of things to settle up with. The defendant refused to give him three months notice of termination. He went on to become a senior surveyor for several years, until he became redundant and then transferred to Halifax. Halifax was a good location for the plaintiff, but his employment there was limited to five months notice. He applied to the Federal Civil Service for a position as regional manager in Nova Scotia, but was denied. He claimed the dismissal letter was never sent to him, and that he had no right to ask for it. Dismissing the action for dismissal without reasonable notice, that the defendant had not expressly and clearly stated that the contract would terminate on 30 days notice. This was not sufficient to abrogate the doctrine of law that reasonable notice must be given."

He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company (STC). The plaintiff was the former president and chief executive officer of the provincial Crown corporation. STC awarded damages against the corporation in the amount of $165,000. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as were either earned or should have beenearned in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum; and third, that all of the plaintiff's Crown corporation service had been for one year rather than three, or two instead of five or even ten. The plaintiff resisted the attribution on pragmatic grounds arguing that the company had not paid any salary, that there was no guarantee the company was going to earn profit, that it needed working capital, and that it was mere fledging."

d_1995canlii4259.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the trial judge arising out of an interpleader application by the respondent Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owing by the Band under a construction contract entered into by the Respondent with the respondent Francis for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. The Respondent had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specified to the various claimants. The respondent had made several assignments to entities other than the Indian Band under the construction contract. In one of these assignments, Francis assigned to the respondent the sum of $101,636.33 to be held at the Council Office in trust. The Chambers judge found that s. 89(1) of the Indian Act was applicable and ordered that the sum be paid to the Eskasoni Band. Another appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal, that the Chambers judge erred in his interpretation of s.89(1). The Act does not either expressly or impliedly confer any greater right upon an assignee of a chose in action that he had before. When an Indian is in business he holds and deals with his or her business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all other Canadians. The protection afforded by s.(1)of the Act was limited to the amount owing to Francis from the time of registration."

The sellers, unrepresented by legal counsel, prepared the transfer of the property and title issued without the words 'joint tenants'. The error describing the purchasers went unnoticed by their lawyer. The respondent had been married to the deceased when he died intestate in 1998. As the title stood an undivided one-half interest was owned by the estate and would devolve to the respondent pursuant to the Intestate Succession Act. HELD: The Land Titles Office Registrar was to amend the existing certificate of title by inserting 'joint tenants' after the names of the registered owners. 1)The requirements set out in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Rochon were satisfied. There was an obvious mistake which required rectification. The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did. 2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other.","FIAT.

d_2002skqb80.txt,"The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion.","The applicant Credit Union loaned the respondent $37,700 upon a security of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer. The respondent's wife had apparently been the person who used the vehicle under the registration agreement but she was never the registered owner of the vehicle until she acquired it from her husband's estate. Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made the respondent aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period between September 11, 2001, to November 14, 2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The wife sought to defeat the securityinterest upon the ground that she was at all times the real owner of her vehicle, had made the payments and was always in possession of it.

d_2003skpc56.txt,"The accused was charged with driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","At the conclusion of the Crown's case, the defence brought a motion to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, such evidence flowing from an invalid approved screening device demand, which infringed the accused's s.8 and s.9 Charter rights. The Crown conceded that if such Charter breaches were found, the appropriate remedy would be to exclude them. At issue was whether the arresting officer formed the requisite belief necessary to make a roadside demand pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Charter, or whether the officer's opinion, so formed, could be objectively upheld on the evidence leading to such a demand. HELD: 1) The words 'had consumed alcohol' are insufficient insufficient for the court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in his body at the time of the ASD demand. 2) Evidence of consumption manifested by physical observation and/or through dialogue with the motorist may well provide such a reasonably reasonable suspicion. The threshold is far lower than the required belief to make the formal breath demand. 3) The wording of the section, however, is clear and unambiguous. It does not leave a trier of fact with the necessity of drawing inferences that consumption of alcohol at some point in itself equates to having alcohol in the body. 4) The importance of noting such material aspect as alcohol coming from the vehicle in this type of investigation is vital. The absence of any reference to it in all five documented reports raises potential disclosure issues at least, which compels the Court to conclude the officer may well be mistaken in this regard. 5) The accused's admission that she had consumed alcohol and that she was unable to produce driver's licence or registration for the vehicle, together with the other evidence he had on hand, could not be relied upon to formulate the required reasonable suspicion, which was the defence's position. 6) The Court was also unable to find sufficient reasons to permit the Certificate to be excluded."

He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","The appellant father was ordered to pay maintenance for his son pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act. The issues on appeal were: 1) whether the father had withdrawn and was unable to withdraw from his parent's charge; 2) whether there was any evidentiary basis upon which the judge could conclude that the Guideline amount was inappropriate and therefore depart from it; and 3) whether it was the father's intention to further his education at a post-secondary educational institution. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs payable by the appellant to the mother in the amount of $2,000; and 4) that the judge erred in law in finding that the child was no longer a dependent child pursuant to s. 2(c) of the Maintenance Act and in ordering maintenance. The father had not withdrawn nor was unable, in fact, to withdraw completely from the charge at the time of the accident; the child had not made firm plans on course of study but was taking a hiatus before continuing his education; and 5) that there was no evidentiary foundation upon which he could have concluded that the support was inappropriate. It was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order."

There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","The appellant appeals his conviction by Crawford, J.P.C. on a charge of sexual assault. The appellant testified at trial denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant says that his conviction is a miscarriage of justice because the judge based her rejection of his testimony on material misapprehensions of the evidence. HELD: The conviction is set aside and a new trial ordered. 1) The court found that the judge's reasons for rejecting the appellant's evidence were based on misapprehendions of evidence. 2) The appellant's arguments were substantial and material. The judge ascribed to the evidence about the involvement of Children's Services, relevance that it simply could not have, and the inference drawn from this evidence could not be more unjustified. 3) The judge misapplied the evidence by failing to give proper effect to it.  4) The trial judge's evidence about not being left alone with the children as a group was substantial. It was not evidence of its truth. The inference drawn by the judge drew from it was not supportable in law or logic. 5) The Court found a pattern of reasoning which was not available to the judge or in logic on this record and therefore the court concluded that it was necessary to set aside the convictions."

Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.","The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence that there were no brake lights on the vehicle, it had to consider the issue of contributory negligence. The plaintiff also argued that it would be a haphazard guess to determine what proportion of her damages might be recovered. Application for summary judgement granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; the plaintiff was making a significant claim yet when one listens to the defendant's counsel and reads the material attached to the plaintiff’s affidavit, one concludes there is a significant amount of other factors relating to the health of the plaintiff."

Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent, who challenged the validity of a search warrant issued by a judge who excluded evidence obtained in the search of her home. The Crown alleged the judge erred in law by failing to apply the proper standard of review. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the judge misapplied the standard upon which he was to review the decision. The court found the warrant was quashed in error. The warrant had been valid, the search was lawful and there was no allegation that it was otherwise unreasonable. However, the evidence obtained as a result of the search had been wrongly excluded and the result would not have been the same. Therefore, the appeal was allowed and ordered a fresh trial.

HELD: The matter will be remitted to the Rentalsman for a rehearing upon proof of service of the Notice of Hearing on all of the tenants.  1) The tenants who are named in the decision are Vernon and Ivy. There is no reference to Richie whose name appears on the tenancy agreement. 2) Even though the decision states that the Notice of Hearing was properly served, that cannot be the end of the matter given that there is nothing in the file which would indicate any directions having been given to the landlord with respect to service other than personal service. Ivy and Richie did not appear at the hearing and the decision does not even identify Richie as being one of the tenants. More is required to ensure service of and notice to all the tenants. 3) There are no notes nor is there anything in the decision which would permit the Court to conclude that the issue of service on Ivy and Richie was ever considered by the Rentalsman.

The issues were whether all the tenants had proper notice of the termination of the tenancy and the hearing, whether the landlord could give notice of termination without any cause, and whether the Rentalsmans could refuse to grant writ ofossession when there was an outstanding order from the Office of the Rentalalsman. HELD: The matter was remitted to the landlord to rehearse on proof of service of the Notice of Hearing on all of the tenants. 1)The landlord failed to vacate the premises in accordance with s.25(1) of the Act. 2)The tenant failed to bring an application pursuant to the Act concerning certain repairs to the premises. 3)The issue of service on the two tenants was not considered.  4)Although the notice of hearing was properly served, there was nothing in the file that would indicate any directions having been given with respect to service other than personal service.  5)The matter must be returned for rehearing upon proof of the service of a notice of disposal on all tenants.  6)The material available for review was limited to the notice served from the notice filed by the appellant and the documents filed. 7)The issues of service were whether the tenant must prove on a balance of probabilities that the issuance of a requested writ of possess was just and equitable.  8)It was not concluded that service on either tenant was ever considered."
d_2007skqb266.txt,"FIAT: The primary issue is whether the father should pay for tutoring expenses. HELD: 1) The father is not opposed to Kody receiving some additional educational assistance. However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400.","FIAT: The Court ordered a number of orders regarding child support and an order regarding summer access. The remaining issues were whether the father should pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children; what, if any, retroactive support should be ordered in this matter; what if any retroactive spousal support was ordered; interim spousals should be payable by the father to the wife; what the cost of the child's school fees was; the Sylvan Learning Centre expenses were necessary and reasonable. The father was to pay his proportionate share of the costs in accordance with his s. 7(1)(d) order; the costs of one child for the summer of 2007 at $1,261, $2,522 and the mother's application for retroactive child support was made pursuant to s. 15.3(1) of the Divorce Act. HELD: 1)The father was ordered to contribute $4300 per month. The mother's evidence that the father will be stretched was considered. The costs of the Childview program, with childcare costs of $7,800 per year, Sylvan learning centre costs at $960 per year and the $3,000 in Sylvan fees were all considered. 2)The Sylvan Education expenses would be reasonable. 3)The mother's claim for interim child support is made pursuant s.7(1).

d_2009nssm48.txt,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","This was an appeal by the landlord from an order of the Director which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy, but also denied the landlord's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the tenant effectively refused to renew for another year. The Landlord appealed. Appeal allowed; the tenancy has not been converted into a Month to Month tenancy because the landlord refused his consent in a timely manner for reasons beyond the control of either the landlord or the tenant. The landlord has the advantage of the Landlord's undertaking to accept an early termination on any date from May 31, 2010 (his undertaking refers to 2009), or perhaps he would have had the option to vacate immediately. The tenant requested an earlier date, given that he has acted in good faith and had no way of knowing that his effort to convert the tenancy into month a month would be thwarted. The Tenant requested that an earlier time be set given that, given the landlord’s written reasons and no finding that the reasons were either arbitrary or unreasonable, they were neither arbitrary nor unreasonable."

Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so. While a dismissal of the criminal appeal is a serious remedy, since it means it will never be heard on its merits, the appellant has made it clear that she cannot provide certified transcripts unless the court orders the respondents to pay. The court has already declined to do so. There is no suggestion a further extension of time will result in the appellant perfecting the appeal.","The appellant appealed the June 29, 2011 decision of the Criminal Appeal Court dismissing her two appeals and ordering the respondents to pay the cost of certifying the 1,700 pages of transcript she had put before the court. At the time of her appeal, the appellant had filed a notice of appeal in the Provincial Court and was in the process of filing a notice for date and directions. At that time, the Registrar of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant's motion to consolidate both appeals and to have the respondents pay to certify the transcripts. The Chambers judge dismissed both appeals for failure to perfect. The respondents' motions to dismiss both appeals were granted. The court dismissed both of the appellant’s motions for dismissal on the basis that they were not related to the same issues and that the appellant was not prepared to pay for the transcript certification. The matter was remitted for trial in 2012 and no dates had been set for the filing of the required materials or the hearing of the appeal. The appellant had submitted that she could not provide certified transcripts because, as she alleged, she had been assaulted by an RCMP officer and she was not criminally responsible for the offence of public mischief. The Court dismissed both applications for dismissal and ordered the respondents’ production and distribution of the transcripts by the end of November. The respondent motion was granted on the same grounds."

MLG was unable to explain how cross-examination would assist the Court.

The court emphasized the importance of providing a proper evidentiary record for the resolution of the issues raised by the application, including clarification of ambiguous evidence, expanding or narrowing the scope of what is said in an affidavit, or exploring matters going to the credibility of the affiant. The fundamental questions were not raised in the affidavits but in the brief of law. The affidavits were not filed in relation to an application for certification.

The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay. As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered. The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay. The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable.","The accused, charged with 56 offences, including conspiracy to commit the indictable offence of fraud by printing and/or cashing forged cheques, defrauding or attempting to defraud contrary to s. 380(1)(b) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession of a counterfeit mark contrary to section 376(2)(b). The accused alleged that his right to a fair trial had been infringed. He sought a judicial stay of proceedings alleging that his rights to a review of material obtained as a result of the charges had been violated.

The children had been in the care of the Minister at various times and parent aides provided help to the parents when there was child or children at home. The Minister called 18 witnesses. HELD: All three children were committed permanently to the Minister. 1)The mother appeared to be more anxious about excusing the father, who was an abusive alcoholic, than about protecting the children. The mother was unable to parent any of the children on her own. It was concluded under s.11(b) of the Act that there was no adult person able and willing to provide for the children's needs and physical or emotional harm may come to the children if it had not already. 2)The father had recently pleaded guilty to sexual assault on an eight year old girl which could, depending on the facts be a ground under s.11(a)(iii) of the Act for a finding of need for protection.","The Minister of Social Services sought an order permanently committing to the Minister all three of the children of the Department permanently committing them to their mother.

The mother, who had been diagnosed as having Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and had been placed on medication, had shown signs of some improvement in some areas of her ability to manage her children. For the past six years, the Department had struggled to overcome the dysfunction in the family and the risks to the children that it would bring if the mother were to be removed from the home and returned to her abusive and neglectful former husband. The father had been physically abused and had continued to be in denial of this or to excuse it. The foster parents had called 18 witnesses to testify, some of whom had been found to be bad people. HELD: 1)The mother was found to have a domino effect as she did not have the competency to parent all three children on her own.  2)The evidence showed that the mother was incapable of supervising or protecting the children and that the children were exposed to domestic disharmony and violence that was part of the ongoing pattern of living of and L. 3)The father could not have been more wrong. The evidence also showed that she had not been able to take steps to protect her children from the abuse.

The original written decision granted release with conditions, pending the appeal scheduled to be heard January 26, 2000. An amended order in October 1999 issued granting the release with condition. The Crown applied to the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal for a written decision granting release. The Chambers judge refused to review the 679 application. Counsel for the Crown argued this was a case of first impression and that the judge misinterpreted the definition of custody. They sought to re-examine the decision of the Chambers judge and found it was within the jurisdiction of the Crown. HELD: 1) The appeal was rescheduled several times due to delay in obtaining the transcript for the appeal book.  2) The Crown relied upon its submission that the petitioner, who was on day parole at the time of his application, was not in custody, therefore, the court misinterpreted its definition. 3) After reviewing the decision the Crown sought a review of the decision and without any new precedents being provided by the Crown following an opportunity to do so, the judge issued a written Decision. The decision was based upon the facts cited in the 678 decision. The court reviewed the case law in a different form on October 20, 1999 and amended order changing several of the conditions was dated October 26, 1999. 4) Counsel were given additional time and claimed they could not find any other cases on this issue. 5) The court concluded that the decision was misinterpreted and that it should be returned to the Chambers Judge for a reconsideration. 6) Counsel sought to conclude that the court had a responsibility to return the matter back to the chambers judge for a decision on the direction of the Chief Judge on the application.

The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 771 for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into the the accused in the respect of a twelve year old girl. The accused was charged with four criminal matters, of sexual assault under s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, uttering a threat, sexual touching under s.(151) and unlawfully having a weapon. The surety denied any wrongdoing and contended the accused did not have a criminal record. HELD: The applications for forfeiture were dismissed. 1) The accused had no concept of his obligations under the recognizee. He mistakenly believed that his responsibilities or liability ended with the accused's first appearance in Court following his release. Certainly he was not aware that he himself could be subject to imprisonment under s773 in the event of default and was not made aware of that fact.  2) The evidence in the case of the surety was that he failed to have an opportunity to read the recognizer before signing it. He stated that after it had been filled out by the justice of peace it was handed to him by the clerk of the court that the document was not explained to him and his obligations as surety were not explained. As is the practice he had not been given a copy of the document. He had no idea it was going to be issued. 3) It would not be just and appropriate to order forfeiture on the part of the accused. He should have had the opportunity to see it before signing. He was suffering from severe arthritis and was unable to work outside the home. 4) The court found that the accused had a reasonable prospect of rehabilitation, employment, and rehabilitation, which would enable him to move to the United States in the near future."

The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln. Fair was convicted of trafficking in marijuana and possession for the purpose of trafficking and Brooks was found not guilty on both counts. The Crown alleged that Brooks consented to the Crown's submission being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture pursuant to S. 20(4) of The Controlled Drugs and Substance Act. Brooks had been the registered owner of the vehicle at the time of the offence and had resided in it for the night. She had stayed in hotel with her husband the night before and was in the front seat when the police stopped the vehicle. Brooks was driving the vehicle and was with Fair when the search of the trunk was conducted. The parties were travelling together when the vehicle was stopped by the RCMP. Brooks deposed that she had seen something on the floor of the car and that it had been used to transport drugs. Brooks did not dispute the assertion by the Crown that the crumbs had not been found in the vehicle but were not in any way connected to the offence. HELD: The application was dismissed. The sentence imposed was grossly disproportionate to the time the Lincoln was seized and the forfeiture provisions were necessary to achieve a valid penal purpose. The societal purpose of the Act and s. 20 (4) permits any person who claims an interest in property forfeited under s.16(1)(a, (b) or (c) to apply for relief. The only person who might have been eligible to apply was an accused of common sense and common sense, whereas the common sense component of the criminal justice system did not apply."

There is no basis in this proceeding to exercise such discretion. 2) There has not been been established the applicants were directly affected. The recommendation from the School Review Committee, that the 79 students would be transferred from Notting Park to Northbrook, permits it to be said the applicant are remote when there is nothing before me but the evidence of only recommendation that the Board establish a school advisory council for each of the sixteen high schools in the area is that there is a significant amount of space that is essentially vacant.

The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The plaintiff had been in the produce department of the store at around 3:45 pm. She had been to the store's maintenance department at around 4:00 pm. The maintenance department had been cleaned at around 5:30 pm. On April 7, 2000, the plaintiff was taken to the Pasqua Hospital Emergency Department where she was bandaged, given painkillers and advised to rest and see her family doctor if her injuries did not improve. She subsequently consulted her family physician, who prescribed more potent painkillers, and recommended physiotherapy. Some of the injuries were at least in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff. 2)The plaintiff did not know the water was there but did know that water and other substances could be on the floor of the produce store and also knew that reasonable steps must be taken to safeguard against the very type of accident experienced by the defendant. 3)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water or produce on the Floor of a grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. The defendant did not knowingly know the waters were there but knew that water, vegetables and other materials could be in the floor and who would be assumed to be willing to assist that party. 4)The evidence conflicted with the affidavits and medical reports filed in evidence and with information elicited during cross-examination. 5)There were inconsistencies in the physician notes, medical reports and the evidence elicited at cross- examination. Some injuries appeared to have been aggravated pre- existing conditions. 6)Costs were awarded to the plaintiff for the costs of the appeal."

The Court concluded that the evidence was weak to the point where there was virtually no choice but to acquit."

At issue was whether there a change of circumstances, which would warrant a variation of the 2002 child support order; whether the 18 year old continued to be a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act; does the father have an obligation to contribute to his daughter's riding lessons; the father's income for child support purposes; should the 17 year old son's s.7 expenses be increased; costs. HELD: 1)The daughter had ceased to be a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and the father's obligation to provide on-going support and his contribution for s.7 expenses relating to her riding lesson terminated in March 2003. 2)The father shall pay $308 per month for support of his son commencing April 1, 2003 and every month thereafter so long as he remains a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 3)The mother's application to increase the father's contribution for the son's extracurricular activities was dismissed. The father shall pay $54 per month for hockey expenses commencing June 2003 and every month thereafter. 4)The mother was to forthwith pay costs of the application fixed at $250.","FIAT. The husband applied to vary the May 2002 support order on the basis that his income had decreased, the parties' oldest child was no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act and his s. 7 expenses had not been incurred for more than a year. The wife opposed the application arguing the layoff was only temporary and that the child continued to be a child of the marriage within the means of the Act. HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to contribute to the child's riding lessons was terminated effective March 31, 2003. 2)The wife's application to increase the husband's contribution for her son's extracurricular activities was dismissed. 3)If the wife followed through with her plan and if she did not, the child may requalify as a 'child of themarriage' within s. 14 of the Guidelines. However, costs were warranted in this case because of the unreasonableness of the wife's position. The unfavourable economic circumstances had not resulted in a change in circumstances. The parties' current income had increased from $23,945 per annum to $37,219 and the husband had been laid off his employment by the time the order was granted. It was not clear if the wife had any knowledge of when the husband would be rehired or if he received employment insurance benefits in 1999 and 2000. The family law judge found that the wife was not entitled to costs of this application."
e_2004nspc8.txt,"The defendant applied for a stay of proceedings on the basis of a violation of his right to be tried in a reasonable time. There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial. Stay of proceedings granted. At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.",This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter. The accused was charged with exceeding the Breathalyzer and impaired driving. He was arraigned on the information and requested the first available date for trial. The Defense had verballyized an intention to raise s. 8 and s. 9 Charter motions and lead evidence. The Crown objected and the accused waived his right to a fair trial. HELD: The application was stayed.  1)The length of the delay was well outside the 8-10 month guideline established in Morin. 2)The applicant asserted his rights to a speedy trial by requesting a first available trial date. He retained counsel and was prepared to fight the merits of the case at trial. It cannot be said that he deliberately or otherwise was attempting to escape trial on the merits. 3)Prejudice can be inferred on the basis of the length of delay as it may interfere with the quality of evidence tendered given the passage of time that has occurred since the charges were filed.
e_2004skca31.txt,"This was an application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules. HELD: The Court declined to lift the stay. While a chambers judge acting under s. 20 of The Court of Appeal Act may not have the independent authority to make a maintenance order, a chambers judge has the authority to stay a judgment in its entirety in the Court of Queen's Bench in certain cases as long as doing so does not decide the appeal. The Court of Appeal stayed the decision of Klebuc J., which left the order of Wright in place, which maintained the existing maintenance obligation.","HELD: On this application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 on the judgment of Klebuc J. dated February 25, 2004, the Court declined to do so for these reasons. The application parallels that of Gerwing J.A., who decided on February 25th, prior to the final reasons being filed, not to lift or to maintain the schedule existing prior to their decision under appeal. Since oral argument, when the mother assumed that maintenance would be paid, the father's counsel filed a detailed brief arguing that staying the execution of Klebbuc J.'s judgment did not revive the prior maintenance order and that a Court of Appeal chambers judge does not have the authority to make such an order. HELD: The application to stay the execution by Rule15 on the judgement of Kleebuc J., which gives the mother custody of the children for slightly more than 50% of the time, leaves the effect of the order declining to lift it. The Court of Queen's Bench Chambers judge cannot make a determinative decision in light of the relatively short time period between the appeal date and the time the matter should be heard."
e_2004skpc82.txt,"The accused youth is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions. However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.","The accused was charged that he did operate a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug, contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges.  1)The Court found that the accused was not displaying any symptoms of impairment. The only signs of impairment were his blood alcohol consumption, a very strong smell of alcohol and a flushed face. 2)On the Crown evidence, the accused did not display slurred speech. He appeared to fully comprehend his rights and obligations in his communications with the peace officer and legal aid duty counsel. However, his response in stopping was somewhat delayed and he braked abruptly. The opportunity to make the observations was only during roughly 2 minutes. 3)The accused suggested that his bloodshot or watery eyes may have been the result of his previous consumption of alcohol or drugs. 4)The court concluded that in the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for these tests, the proper method of application and to comment on their reliability, it was not appropriate for the court to rely upon them on the issue of guilt or innocence, to the prejudice of the accused."

HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict. 2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant. The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered. The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct. The offence of dangerous driving was established and the accused was found guilty. 4) The accused was found guilty of two counts of assault.","HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused was guilty of both charges. The Court believed that the evidence of the accused who had been assaulted by the complainant and had been drinking and the victim of a domestic dispute had been found to be unreliable. Therefore, the Court found the accused guilty."
e_2005skpc8.txt,"The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged that he committed a sexual assault on the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1) The complainant was employed as clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and although she testified that she knew of the accused in 1999, it was much more likely that she met him in the spring of 2002 after he assumed his duties as Justice of the Peace in the same building. The Court found that the accused had not been detained and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) had been infringed. 2) The accused's evidence was examined. It was clear that the complainant had been approached by the accused who had been in the general counsel's office and that he had asked her to take a position in the courtroom. The accused had responded by saying that he was crazy, that he could get into trouble and that the police investigation was underway. 3) There was some consistency as to the incidents that occurred prior to August 21/2003. The complainant gave her evidence in an honest and straightforward fashion. She was vigorously cross-examined. While her recollection was not perfect, she believed that she had been given an indication that she didn't want this touching to occur and that she continued to pursue it. 4) The evidence showed that the defendant had a general integrity and intelligence, the witness's powers to observe and the relationship that the witness had with the accused. 5) It was necessary that certain findings of credibility be made in this case.  6) The Court held that the Crown should not be permitted to use the statement as evidence and, in that manner, to allow the Crown to split its case."

The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties. The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action. Corrigendum received dated July 20, 2006 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff applies for certification of this action pursuant to the Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight being chartered by Air Canada. The flight was delayed for about an hour and half at the Punta Cana airport as a result of several evolving mechanical difficulties referred to by the pilot as 'creeping delay'. The defendants opposed the certification application on the basis that none of the five criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act had been met by the applicant. The plaintiff states that the plaintiff was negligent in not taking proper precautions and should have made alternate arrangements or taken additional precautions to ensure that there were no excessive delays. Regarding the plaintiff's claim for damages against Air Canada, the Court notes that Air Canada has incorporated into its Act the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. In addition, Air Canada and Air Canada have entered into an agreement whereby Air Canada will pay damages to the passengers of the departing flight. In this action, the plaintiff seeks damages against the defendants for negligence, breach of contract or unlawful confinement. The defendants deny any negligence, fraud, breach or other non-compensatory damages. HELD: The Court held that although the plaintiff had no cause of action on its own, it would have been high onus to satisfy the Court that the pleadings disclose a cause for action. The test to be applied in certification applications is similar to those used in applications to strike a statement of claim as disclosing no cause. The Court should be reluctant to deny a plaintiff his or her day in court. Although the Court would have dismissed the certification applications on the sole basis of not meeting the criteria as outlined in the Act, the court found that the plaintiffs pleadings would only be struck if it was plain and obvious that the defendant cannot succeed. The generous approach to be adopted on this application is specifically spelled out in S. 4(2)(b) of The CAA which provides that the court may adjourn the application for certification to permit the parties to amend their materials or pleadings or to permit further evidence to be introduced.

e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. The only evidence led in the voir dire at the trial was that of the police officer who stopped the respondent in a routine traffic stop of vehicles entering Saskatoon from the east. After the officer determined that he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the respondent was operating his motor vehicle while impaired, he arrested the respondent, read the respondent his right to retain counsel and gave the requisite police warning. The Certificate of Analysis was excluded. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge failed to address the real issue of whether the respondent had a waiver of the right to consult with a lawyer on a free and open basis, and he failed to provide unequivocal advice to the Crown as to the extent that the waiver could have been obtained by any reasonable person. The Crown did not demonstrate a waiver was required by law. 2) The lack of Prosper warning does not mean the respondent’s waiver was not valid. The Court must examine the evidence to determine whether the Crown had met the burden of establishing that respondent gave an unequivocal waiver when he changed his mind about seeking legal counsel. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the Respondent was frustrated. Impatient, probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about 5 minutes. The breathalyzer certificate in this case was excluded as it was a direct result of the breach. The police were required to tell the detainee of his right and reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and of the obligation on the part of the Police during this time to refrain from having them participate in any process that would incriminate him. 4) The holding-off requirement in this application flows logically from the two implementation duties of s. 7 and s. 8 of the charter. The trial court concluded that the failure of the Crown to provide an unequivococal waiver to the respondent on this issue was of no consequence to the appellant. 5) The failure of Crown to disclose the existence and availability of the applicable systems of duty counsel and Legal Aid in that jurisdiction was a serious breach of the appellant” s. 9(b). The Crown was not required to disclose this information to the accused. 6) The respondent was clearly frustrated and agreed to provide the sample without first talking to a lawyer after these attempts."
e_2006skqb534.txt,"The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.","The respondent applies to vary the child support orders of the Chief Justice of the Divorce Act and/or the alleged agreement struck by the petitioner and the respondent in or about July 2003. The respondent seeks this variation pursuant to s. 17(1) of thedivorce act and pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act. HELD: 1) The Court does not find the petitioner's conduct blameworthy. To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, represents a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner’s category. 2) The respondent has not engaged in blameness. The parties negotiated through their lawyers, as well as the respondent, in the course of reviewing child support. 3) There is no evidence that an agreement was struck as the petitioner failed to disclose her tax return. 4) There was no agreement or obligation to disclose. The petitioner was content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children.  5) The petitioner did not seek a variation in any event.  6) The court reviewed the relevant circumstances and found that the respondent did not fail to comply with his or her obligations under the 2003 agreement. The court found that it would be unfair to the respondent to require her to pay $380 when there was no evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children in this time period."

There were daycare costs when the wife worked, and the applicant's transportation costs were high (but reasonable). The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards. The applicant did not have any credit either. Their home had little, if any, equity. The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan.

e_2009nssc204.txt,"An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment. The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","The appellant was a student at a university when he sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the professor did not take the content of the attachment as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to cause death to the professor. The appellant contended the Crown had not properly explained the sender's intent and that the sender was a computer program. The Crown alleged the sender sent the email to the student in the Math Resource Centre in Nova Scotia and that it was intended to intimidate the student and to get reaction from the student. The trial judge dismissed the evidence, finding that the evidence was rife with hearsay and very prejudicial to the appellant's credibility. The appeal proceeded on the basis that the trial judge failed to address the admissibility of evidence, unfair and prejudicial cross-examination of the appellant and a failure to give due consideration to a conditional discharge. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The trial judge did not address any of the instances of prejudicial or hearsay evidence that came in through the witness' testimony. 2)The evidence was part of the 'narrative' and the Crown was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements of the offence. The evidence was properly presented and the court found that the appellant had not shown that he intended the student to read the contents of the e-mail and that he had not de-bugged it. The only reasonable inference that one could draw was that the student thought that someone was monitoring what he was typing and he did not run it as he did de-Bugge it. 3)There was no evidence that the accused intended to kill the student or that the message was meant to intimidate or be taken seriously. There was sufficient evidence that would permit a reasonable trier of fact, properly instructed and acting reasonably, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on those elements. 4)The accused was found guilty and sentenced immediately following the conclusion of his trial to an 18 month suspended sentence, and placed on probation with conditions."
e_2009skca40.txt,"This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","This was an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant sought to set aside the transaction under various heads of contract law including duress, undue influence, unconscionability, equitable fraud and mistake. The facts briefly are that the appellant, a widow, agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including a residence and some grain bins, to the respondents, the Clements, by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000 allocated $100,000 for the land and $20,000. The terms were indeed favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over 7 years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. The trial judge found that the respondent McLaughlin was not shown to have breached or failed any professional obligation. Allowing the appeals, that the central facts of the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and conduct of Clements were supported by probative evidence and no possible attack on the contract exists. On these facts no possible attacks on thecontract exist."
e_2010skca79.txt,"The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. The appellant appealed his convictions and his sentence, arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter was too severe. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons.  1) The issues identified by the appellant do not operate to make his convictions unreasonable. The trial judge warned the jury about the dangers of eye witness identification evidence. She underscored that an honest and apparently convincing witness can be mistaken on identification issues. 2) When the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not in any way left with the impression that, if it was the appellant who was driving the white Tempo, it somehow followed the driver of the other vehicle. The evidence raised by the trial judge clearly indicated that it could not be drawn on the basis of her assessment of the appellant's veracity. It was open to the jury to consider on a common sense basis whether it was likely that the appellant could have outrun the police officer. 3) The appellant's arguments were not misplaced. The jury was alerted to them and were not misled. The appeal court was unable to conclude that the verdict reached by the Jury was one that properly instructed a trier of fact, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered."
e_2011skqb134.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of using credit card data to fraudulently obtain services contrary to s. 342(3) of the Criminal Code, one count of fraud over $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1) of the Criminal Code for defrauding Sasktel of telephone services and one count of fraudulently personating various persons with intent to gain advantage for himself contrary to s. 403(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences. The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names. He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services. The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44. The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items. The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18. The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail. He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders. In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities. He plead guilty. HELD: A fit sentence in global terms for these offences would be 8 years and 6 months. The accused was given credit for 4 years and 9 months for the time he spent in custody. The accused was sentenced to 2 years and 3 months for the s. 342(3) offence, 1 year and 6 months consecutive for the offence under s. 380(1) and 2 years concurrent for the personation offence under s. 403(a). The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","The accused was charged with two counts of fraud. The Crown stayed the count and imposed a global sentence of eight years and six months. The accused plead guilty to three counts of theft. The sentences were varied to correspond to the gravity of the offence, the time actually served on remand. HELD: The global sentence was reduced to four years and nine months from the total of 10 years and 9 months. 1) The accused pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud Saskatchewan Telecommunications of services and goods of a value exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and two counts for fraudulently obtaining goods and services by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means contrary to ss. 403(a) and (b). 2) The Court imposed a combined sentence of 8 years and 6 months, which was eight years six months and the credit for time spent in custody was reduced accordingly. 3) The discretion to grant the credit remains with me despite s. 719(3) and s.719(4) of The Criminal Code because the offences were committed and the charges brought before enactment of the section. 4) The offence was very high because of a number of aggravating circumstances. The dollar value of goods and the total deprivation inflicted was $25,915.44. 5) The two schemes were pursued over a lengthy period of time and involved scores of transactions. There were many individuals and businesses subjected to embarrassment and anxiety.  6) There were a further three counts, one of which dealt with the value of the goods. 7) The Crown provided a credit of four years nine months for time served in custody. The credit should be one for one, or put otherwise, the amount actually served while he was incarcerated. The Credit should be four years, nine months, and the global sentence should be reduced accordingly, as he had no income for some time."
e_2011skqb244.txt,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","The appellant appeals his conviction for impaired care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit of.08 contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argued that the learned trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count, namely that the central Crown witness provided exculpatory evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The trial judge did not err in his treatment of the evidence. The Crown did not object to the appellant's observations concerning slurred speech. The appeal court relied on the evidence of the breathalyzer operator (who testified that he noted the appellant appeared to have been drinking, that he had been in the motor vehicle earlier, and that he smelled alcohol on his breath). 2) The appellant was not excluded from his rights to appeal. He was in good standing with the court in this case."
e_2011skqb444.txt,"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and common assault. The court found that the accused’s actions were done in self-defence. Given that the video evidence and the testimony of corrections officers, it was not legally necessary to establish that the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the injuries caused to the victim fell within the definition of wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life. The accused”s position in the trial was based on the premise that the charges were based on an incident captured on security video. The Crown had established that the assault was done in a fashion that reflected the reality that the victim was on a “gang range” and that the members of the group were acting in concert for the purpose of “defence”. In this case, the Crown established the existence of an actual assault by establishing that the events leading up to the assault were motivated by a common sense sense sense of justice and were motivated in part by the victim” s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code. The three elements of the accused were determined: 1) the subjective perception of the situation was subjective; 2) the accused reasonably believed that the defendant was being assaulted; and 3) that he believed on reasonable grounds that he could not otherwise preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm at the hands of the defendant. The terms “aiding’ and “abetting” have similar meanings. The term “insurance” under s. 21(1)(b) means to assist or assist. The requirement of an objective analysis ensures that the criminal law encourages reasonable and responsible behaviour. In all of the circumstances, the court established that bodily harm was objectively foreseeable by the accused as a consequence to the plot to which he was party. The defendant admitted to the actions of his group and said that they believed on a reasonable basis that he did not have to tell the police. The judge concluded that the three elements were met: the accused was jointly responsible for the assault; the accused had a specific plan; the defendant communicated with the inmate that he was going to throw hot liquid in his face; and the defendant had a distinctive jacket; and Finally, the defendant admitted that he and his group moved in unison to attack the victim."
e_2012skpc161.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","The accused pleaded guilty to aggravated assault thereby endangering the life of a Metis youth contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence that he report to his youth worker, contrary to the s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The Crown applied under section 42(9) for a determination that the aggravated assault be designated as a serious violent offence. The accused was sentenced to a secure custodial sentence of 24 months to be followed by a period of probation with credit for pre-sentence detention, 6 months of community supervision and 6 months community supervision. On the offences of breach of undertaking (including a weapons offence) and breach of probation (including breaching a promise to provide a DNA sample and a weapons prohibition), the sentence was increased to a total of 40 months, followed by 12 months of custody and community supervision (which would total 24 months). The accused will be permanently disabled by the time he is sentenced. The offence was committed in a secure facility and the accused did not oppose the Crown's application. HELD: The court sentenced the accused to 24 months imprisonment followed by 6 months probation. On each of the offences, the accused was given credit for an additional period of time (12 months) consisting of 12 months in closed custody followed by 1 year of probation. The sentence was adjusted to reflect the time spent in pre- sentencing detention and to include an additional 12 months for community supervision, which would total 40 months.

e_2013skca1.txt,"The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The chambers judge dismissed the application and certified the action as a class action against all defendants. The proposed appellants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 for an order granting them leave to appeal from the chambers judge's certification order and his dismissal of their Rule 173(c) application. They argued that the Chambers judge erred in law in failing to apply the Ann's test, by conflating foreseeability with proximity, in the first leg of the test, and by failing to consider and apply the policy considerations which may preclude or negate the finding of duty of care under the second leg of that test. They also raised the ground that the respondent did not establish a common issue which met the commonality requirements of the Class Actions Act. Dismissing the application with the exception of the Rule 173c application, that the Chamber judge did not apply the test in Re: Collections Inc. v. Toronto Dominion Bank (CanLII), when there was no conflict between the affidavits of the Messrs. Friedman and Scott as to what had transpired between them and there was, in fact, the evidence of the parties' involvement in the mining industry, and the tax opinions provided by the respondent. The Chambers judge made no errors in law, nor in his interpretation of the law applicable to the facts before him, but in his analysis of the common law issues affecting individual members of a class, and in his conclusion that there was a lack of commonality between the practicants and the clients, which may have been the basis of his decision to dismiss the application."
e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent seeks to expunge child support arrears that have accumulated as a result of his not paying child support for many years. He is 72 years old and practising internal medicine in the United States. The petitioner is disabled and the father is looking to retire in the next few years. HELD: 1) The respondent will have a few lean years until he has paid off the arrear. But not an undue hardship. Almost every dollar that was applied to child support was taken from the petitioner by garnishment process or the interception of federal government monies directed to him. He should receive the full amount that, but for his dodging his obligations, would have been available to him when she was raising their children.  2) The arsars owed by the respondent are $183,746. 3) The petitioner has struggled for 25 years to get the respondent to pay child support. She is on long term disability. She has been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression. The father's child support obligation under the 2001 order has continued even though the respondent did not record it on its statement. He has violated the 2001 Order by putting money away for his children's care. He overstates the case based on his 2011 income and expenses. It appears that he is trying to prepare for his retirement. The Court takes into account the fact that his children are children of the marriage and that he has not paid child support in the past 12 years. 4) The Court finds that the respondent does not have the ability to pay the child support owed. It is repugnant to even suggest that reducing the arsors."

The court imposed numerous conditions on her, including that she could not have or consume alcohol and should report to a probation officer, receive addiction counselling, participate in AA meetings and provide proof of her attendance to her probation officer. Her driver’s license was cancelled and she was prohibited from driving for two years.","The accused entered guilty plea to one count of driving a motor vehicle while her blood alcohol content was over 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and asked to be granted a curative discharge pursuant to s. 255(5) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The Court found that the accused was in need of treatment to deal with her alcohol consumption and addiction. Based on the evidence and the able arguments of the parties, a conditional discharge would not be contrary to the public interest. 1)Given the two prior convictions for drinking and driving, the accused had been through the Impaired Driver Treatment Centre (IMADA) and was in good standing with the public. 2)She had demonstrated good sobriety and was motivated to continue treatment. 3)Given her 2 prior convictions (1 for driving while over the legal limit and 1 for impaired driving), her conduct over the last 18 months suggested that it was probable that she would not drink and drive again. The Court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that her case was the exceptional case contemplated in Ashberry and Ahenakew and that a curatorial discharge would be best served than a fine or custodial sentence."
e_2017skqb219.txt,"HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent. They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.","The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother of the two children. The grandmother argues she is person of sufficient interest with respect to the children and that the father should have joint custody with the children but her home should be the children's primary residence. The father seeks an order that he have custody of the children. HELD: 1) There is an interim order designating the grandmother as a personof sufficient interest. This designation was made pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and is applicable when a family member pursues custody. Not only does the grandmother have a blood tie to the child, but the children have lived with her for the past seven years. Her access is to be intermittent and she will provide the father with parenting time.  2) The father was granted interim access in the summer of 2017. He will have access every second weekend. There is no evidence that the grandmother has a conventional family or blood relationship with the child. The evidence from the father that the children play in the park frequently is that the mother is the primary caretaker of the four children. It is clear that the relationship between the grandmother and the children has evolved over the years. The grandparents have always been close and have been very active in supporting one another. 3) The grandmother has always been a person with sufficient interest in the children, even if her position is that she and the father need to have custody to allow the father to have reasonable and liberal access. She should have received an order for substitutional service on the father prior to the mother moving out.  4) The grandparents are persons of sufficient interests. The proper focus of an inquiry in relation to the “sufficient interest question” is the nature of the relationship. The nature of their relationship, the relationship, and the child's best interests does not enter the analysis at that point. In determining whether non-family applicant is person With sufficient Interest, the court must consider a variety of factors including the extent or degree of the grandmother's involvement, the duration of the involvement, what parenting arrangement would be in the best interests of thechildren, what child support should be payable by the father and the grandmother. The issues must be determined whether the grandmother can show a settled commitment to and an intention to be continuing and meaningful presence in the life of the child and the issues of the parties. The issue of access is the grandmother’ s.6 designation pursuant to S.6 of the Act. The designation of the"
